management overview 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world had an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition since the first quarter of 2020 the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have implemented and continue to implement a variety of containment measures including travel restrictions bans and advisories instructions to practice social distancing curfews quarantine advisories including quarantine restrictions after travel in certain locations “shelterinplace” orders required closures of nonessential businesses vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees’ vaccination status and other restrictions while the process of vaccinating their residents against covid19 is underway in many countries with various levels of success the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines the unavailability of vaccines in many regions the impact of vaccine hesitancy as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants of the virus may all contribute to delays in economic recovery particularly for the travel industry 

overall the full duration and total impact of covid19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and in particular our business going forward 

general description of our business 

expedia group inc is an online travel company and our mission is to power global travel for everyone everywhere we believe travel is a force for good travel is an essential human experience that strengthens connections broadens horizons and bridges divides we leverage our supply portfolio platform and technology capabilities across an extensive portfolio of consumer brands and provide solutions to our business partners to empower travelers to efficiently research plan book and experience travel we seek to grow our business through a dynamic portfolio of travel brands including our majorityowned subsidiaries that feature a broad multiproduct supply portfolio — with approximately 3 million lodging properties available including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings and approximately 875000 hotels over 500

airlines packages rental cars cruises insurance as well as activities and experiences across most countries travel suppliers distribute and market products via our desktop and mobile offerings as well as through alternative distribution channels our business partnerships and our call centers in order to reach our extensive global audience in addition our advertising and media businesses help other businesses primarily travel providers reach a large multiplatform audience of travelers around the globe 

over 25 years ago we began operations as one of the first online travel agencies “otas” and played a significant role in revolutionizing and democratizing travel by empowering customers to manage their own travel plans we did so by building and then leveraging proprietary technology to connect partners and their respective inventory to those travelers while unlocking the marketplace for travel to other businesses as well since then the travel industry has experienced significant transformation including the material shift from offline to online travel booking this transformation led to many years of exciting growth for otas along with increased competition in order to remain innovative and competitive we made several strategic acquisitions which materially expanded the breadth and depth of our company much of our strategy leading up to the covid19 pandemic focused on our brands competing aggressively for share all the around the world each with their own offerings and benefits while this avoided potential disruptions from integrating the acquired brands it also created certain complexities and inefficiencies over time 

as a result in 2020 we shifted to a platform operating model which enabled us to deliver more scalable services and operate more efficiently for example we now manage our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio allowing us to optimize results better while running on a unified marketing technology platform has improved our performance marketing capabilities more recently we shifted to a more unified brand strategy within our retail business where we have a combined team making decisions across all our brands these changes were made in an effort to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and the operation of our business 

within our b2b business on november 1 2021 the sale of egencia to american express global business travel “gbt” was completed as part of the transaction expedia group received a minority ownership position in the combined business and entered into a 10year lodging supply agreement with gbt moreover to help streamline activities and focus on our core businesses we have closed shut down or sold a number of businesses since the beginning of 2020 the largest of which was egencia overall we have made good progress on the foundational work to help streamline and simplify the organization over roughly the past two years and therefore can now increase our focus on further improving the travel experience which was also the company’s underlying goal more than two decades ago 

market opportunity and business strategy 

expedia group is one of the world’s largest online travel companies yet our gross bookings represent a singledigit percentage of total worldwide travel spending highlighting the size of our market opportunity phocuswright estimated global travel spending inclusive of alternative accommodations at approximately 19 trillion in 2020 prior to the onset of covid19 with an increasing share booked through online channels each year 

as we endeavor to power global travel for everyone everywhere our focus is to leverage our brand and supply strength and our platform to provide greater services and value to our travelers suppliers and business partners and generate sustained profitable growth 

leverage brand and supply strength to power the travel ecosystem we believe the strength of our brand portfolio and consistent enhancements to product and service offerings combined with our global scale and broadbased supply drive increasing value to customers and customer demand with our significant global audience of travelers and our deep and broad selection of travel products we are also able to provide value to supply partners wanting to grow their business through a better understanding of travel retailing and consumer demand in addition to reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach our deep product and supply footprint allows us to tailor offerings to target different types of consumers and travel needs employ geographic segmentation in markets around the world and leverage brand differentiation among other benefits recently we shifted to more of a unified brand strategy with an increased focus on uniting our retail brands and teams under one centralized group which we believe will enable us to drive further value to travelers for example in 2021 we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform spanning all products and global brands we also market to consumers through a variety of channels including internet search metasearch and social media websites and having multiple brands appear in search results also increases the likelihood of attracting new visitors

leverage our platform to deliver more rapid product innovation resulting in better traveler experiences during 2020 expedia group shifted to a platform operating model with more unified technology product data engineering and data science teams building services and capabilities that are leveraged across our business units to serve our end customers and provide valueadd services to our travel suppliers this model enables us to deliver more scalable services and operate more efficiently all of our transactionbased businesses share and benefit from our platform infrastructure including customer servicing and support data centers search capabilities and transaction processing functions including payment processing and fraud operations 

as we continue to evolve our platform infrastructure our focus is on developing technical capabilities that support various travel products while using common applications and frameworks we believe this strategy will enable us to build in parallel because of simpler standard architecture ship products faster create more innovative solutions and achieve greater scale and ultimately we believe this will result in faster product innovation and therefore better traveler experiences which is a bigger focus for the company going forward in addition over time as we enable domains around application development frameworks we believe we can unlock additional platform service opportunities beyond our internal brands and other business travel partners 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by our virtual agent platform telephone or email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse contact centers our contact centers are located in several countries throughout the world we invested significantly in our contact center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our contact center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward in addition we have continued to invest in our conversation platform which leverages technology and artificial intelligence to provide online customer service options and selfservice capabilities to our customers through our websites and apps

we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model 

• merchant model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms alternative accommodations airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings for example we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip generally when they book the reservation the majority of our merchant transactions relate to lodging bookings 

• agency model under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler we record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing additionally we generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied and 

• advertising model under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings across several of our transactionbased websites as well as on our majorityowned metasearch site trivago 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we had total revenue of 86 billion with merchant agency and advertising media and other accounting for 64 27 a nd 9 of t otal revenue respectively 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia group in advance under our merchant model expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay under the agency model hotel collect 

in addition through various of our expedia groupbranded and other multiproduct websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately travelers typically select packages based on the total package price or by purchasing one product and receiving a discounted price to attach additional products the use of the merchant travel components in packages and multiproduct purchases enable us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers and customers that come directly to our websites we manage our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our retail segment to optimize results for the company and making decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media websites brand advertising through online and offline channels loyalty programs mobile apps and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our current traveler loyalty programs include hotelscom rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia®rewards on a wide array of brand expedia points of sale as well as orbitz rewards on orbitzcom in 2021 we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into 

table of contents 

one global rewards platform spanning all products and global brands the cost of our loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing several of our branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia hotelscom or vrbo cobranded offering or a private label website our expedia partner solutions business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

travel suppliers 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies property owners and managers large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines destination service providers and other travel partners we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

we developed proprietary technology to assist hotel suppliers in managing pricing and marketing their supply our “direct connect” technology allows hotels to upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems and to automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers proprietary marketing tools assist hotels in tailoring demand to their requirements and our revenue management product provides pricing insight based on expedia group data and analytics our suite of white label website offerings power hotel package and meeting space booking on suppliers own websites 

in addition vrbos alternative accommodation listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers which enables them to manage an availability calendar reservations inquiries and the content of the listing as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia group and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia group is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in 

table of contents 

some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation websites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property and appurtenant rights including our patents trademarks copyright rights domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are important components of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands domain names and website urls software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that support and make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate and necessary respectively we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions and obtaining licenses in patents as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us we also protect some inventions and methods by maintaining them as trade secrets either because it provides superior and potentially longertermed protection or because the invention is not patentable but provides us with a competitive advantage 

in connection with our copyrightable content we post and institute procedures under the digital millennium copyright act and similar host privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs text and other content uploaded by users however differences between statutes limitations on immunity and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the alternative accommodation industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

table of contents 

in international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

we are also subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa came into force in january 2020 which applies enhanced data protection requirements in the state of california similar to those that have existed since 2018 under the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr similar laws are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions 

compliance with these laws rules and regulation has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods however certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements may relate to our business in the future

 part i item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities if any of the following risks occur our business andor financial performance could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

covid19 pandemic and travel industry risks 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on the travel industry and our business financial performance and liquidity position 

the covid19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world had an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition 

since the first quarter of 2020 the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have implemented and continue to implement a variety of containment measures including travel restrictions bans and advisories instructions to practice social distancing curfews quarantine advisories including quarantine restrictions after travel in certain locations “shelterinplace” orders required closures of nonessential businesses vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees’ vaccination status and other restrictions during the course of the pandemic governments have implemented additional containment measures in response to new variants of the virus including mostrecently in response to the omicron variant individuals’ ability to travel has also been curtailed through border closures mandated travel restrictions and limited operations of hotels and airlines and may be further limited through additional voluntary or mandated closures of travelrelated businesses while the process of vaccinating their residents against covid19 is underway in many countries with various levels of success the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines the unavailability of vaccines in many regions the impact of vaccine hesitancy as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants of the virus may all contribute to delays in economic recovery particularly for the travel industry 

the measures implemented to contain the covid19 pandemic have at times led to significantly heightened levels of cancellations and continues to have a negative impact on the number of new travel bookings moreover we have modified our cancellation policies in light of the covid19 pandemic and will continue to adapt our cancellation policies as the situation evolves the significant increase in refunds that we experienced in 2020 and may continue to experience has led to materially negative cash flow which has and will continue to negatively impact our cash balance and overall liquidity position until travel demand begins to recover from current levels we also may be negatively impacted by the loss of opportunity to crosssell or market products and services to customers who originally booked air travel with us but who will ultimately redeem air travel credits received during the covid19 pandemic directly from the airlines we may also face inquiries and investigations from government regulators who claim that we should have refunded travelers or taken actions to otherwise provide redress to travelers who could not travel due to covid19 restrictions 

the pandemic has impeded global economic activity for an extended period and could continue to do so even as restrictions are moderated or lifted and vaccines become more widely distributed leading to a continuation of the already significant decrease in per capita income and disposable income increased and sustained unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence all of which could significantly reduce discretionary spending by individuals and businesses on travel in turn that could have a negative impact on demand for our services and could lead our partners or us to reduce prices or offer incentives to attract travelers we also cannot predict the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on our partners and their business and operations or the ways that the pandemic may fundamentally alter the travel industry in particular we may need to adapt to a travel industry with fewer and different suppliers as well as structural changes to certain types of travel 

while we have undertaken certain actions to attempt to mitigate the effects of covid19 on our business our costsavings activities may lead to disruptions in our business inability to enhance or preserve our brand awareness reduced employee morale and productivity increased attrition and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for the reasons set forth above and other reasons that may come to light as the covid19 pandemic and containment measures evolve over time it is difficult to estimate with accuracy the impact to our future revenues results of operations cash flows liquidity or financial condition but such impacts have been and will continue to be significant and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity position for the foreseeable future

we operate in an intensely competitive global environment and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors 

the market for the services we offer is intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional providers of travelrelated services including online travel agencies alternative accommodation providers wholesalers and tour operators travel product suppliers including hotels airlines and car rental companies search engines and large online portal websites travel metasearch services corporate travel management service providers mobile platform travel applications social media websites ecommerce and group buying websites and other participants in the travel industry 

online travel agencies and alternative accommodations providers in particular we face increasing competition from other otas and alternative accommodations in many regions such as booking holdings through its bookingcom and agodacom websites tripcom and airbnb any of which may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth our ota competitors are increasingly expanding the range of travel services they offer and the global ota segment continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships airbnb booking holdings and other providers of alternative accommodations provide an alternative to hotel rooms and compete with alternative accommodation properties available through expedia group brands including vrbo the continued growth of alternative accommodation providers could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and alternative accommodations furthermore airbnb has and similar providers could increasingly look to add other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional otas 

travel suppliers travel suppliers such as hotels airlines and rental car companies may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them many of these competitors have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors through favorable rates and bonus or loyal points for direct booking surcharges for booking outside of the supplier’s own website suppliers combining to establish a single search platform and other tactics to drive traffic directly to supplier websites 

search engines and large online portal websites we also face increasing competition from google and other search engines there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance to the extent that google continues to use its market position to disintermediate online travel agencies through its own offerings or capabilities refer customers directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites offer the ability to transact on its own website or promote its own competing products by placing its own offerings at the top of organic search results 

in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas for example google has continued to add features and functionality to its travel metasearch products “google travel” “google flights” and “hotel ads” which are growing rapidly and has integrated reservation functionality into the hotel ads product in addition google may be able to leverage the data they collect on users to the detriment of us and other otas search engines also may continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our brands or brands in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivago compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch websites travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of booking holdings trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia group tripadvisor skyscanner and qunar both are subsidiaries of tripcom aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch websites have looked to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise or if ota advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago’s metasearch marketplace trivago’s business and therefore our results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers by virtue of our minority ownership stake in and longterm supply 

table of contents 

agreement with gbt we compete indirectly with online and traditional corporate travel providers as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services our brands also compete to attract unmanaged business travelers 

mobile and other platform travel applications the demand for and functionality of smartphones tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

applications and social media websites applications and social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition 

ecommerce and group buying websites traditional consumer ecommerce platforms including amazon and alibaba and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market for example traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites to the extent our travelers use these websites these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

other participants in the travel industry other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services we offer to our travelers our travel industry affiliates and partners or our corporate clients for example ridesharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate to the extent any of these services gain market share over time it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or offer differentiated products and services to our travelers increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity some of our competitors may also have other significant advantages such as greater financial resources or name recognition more favorable corporate structures or a broader global presence among others 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or healthrelated events our business and financial performance are affected by the overall health of the worldwide travel industry factors that could negatively affect the travel industry in general and our business in particular potentially materially include political instability geopolitical conflicts trade disputes significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues macroeconomic concerns bans on travel to and from certain countries significant changes in oil prices continued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation reduced access to discount fares travel strikes or labor unrest labor shortages whether due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise bankruptcies or liquidations increased incidents of actual or threatened terrorism natural disasters travelrelated accidents or grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns and changes to visa and immigration requirements or border control policies our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and average daily rates “adrs” changes in airline capacity and airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

our businesses may also be negatively impacted by direct and indirect impacts of climate change direct effects may include disruptions to travel due to more frequent or severe storms hurricanes flooding rising sea levels shortages of water droughts and wildfires and indirect effects may include new travelrelated regulations policies or conditions related to sustainability and climate change concerns 

because these events or concerns and the full impact of their effects are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers and decrease demand decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity war or travelrelated health events could result in significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions and travelrelated health events provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

table of contents 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers including owners and managers of alternative accommodation properties and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular lodging suppliers airlines and gds partners for bookings made through our channels each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous supplier contracts 

no assurances can be given that travel suppliers will elect to participate in our platform or that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services for example adrs or ticket prices attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

financial risks 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may whether due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors out of our control be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

if our liquidity is materially diminished we may not be able to timely pay debts or leases or comply with material provisions of our contractual obligations although our cash flows from operations and available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet obligations and commitments to date we cannot predict how the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts could affect our liquidity in the future our substantial indebtedness the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness and market conditions may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to meet potential future liquidity needs 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or healthrelated events we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers if as was the case in 2020 our merchant hotel business declines it would likely result in further pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

our ability to raise financing depends in significant measure on characteristics of the capital and credit markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets and constraints on our liquidity we cannot guarantee that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or other actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar ratings agencies deterioration of our financial condition increase in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital including with respect to ratings downgrades the interest rate applicable to certain of our outstanding senior notes 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2021 we have outstanding longterm indebtedness excluding current maturities with a face value of 78 billion and we have revolving credit facilities with outstanding commitments totaling 20 billion which is essentially untapped risks relating to our indebtedness include 

table of contents 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

in addition our revolving credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests including a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facilities or any agreement governing our other indebtedness including the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds and our secured lenders may be able to foreclose against the assets constituting collateral for our secured debt in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business or otherwise the terms of our revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

operational risks 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we rely heavily on internet search engines such as google through the purchase of travelrelated keywords and through organic search to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the placement or cost of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch websites including kayak tripadvisor and trivago pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or display of results which could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit participation in the search query results in particular google has in the past and may continue to in the future change its algorithms or results in a manner that has negatively affected the search engine ranking paid and unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates and those of our thirdparty distribution partners which has adversely impacted our business and financial performance google has also increasingly added its own travel search functionality and content at the expense of traditional paid listings and organic search results which may continue to reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates if google or other search or metasearch companies continue to pursue these or similar strategies which is out of our control or we do not successfully manage our paid and unpaid search strategies we could face a significant decrease in traffic to our websites andor increased costs related to replacing unpaid traffic with paid traffic 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base in exist ing and emerging markets we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase and given the economic uncertainty and unpredictability around when the travel industry will recover decisions we make on investing in brands could be less effective and costlier than expected 

in recent years certain online travel companies and metasearch websites expanded their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

table of contents 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically resulting in less direct traffic and increased customer acquisition costs moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia group portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio in addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

payments regulations the processing and acceptance of a variety of payment methods is subject to various laws rules regulations legal interpretations and regulatory guidance including those governing crossborder and domestic money transmission and funds transfers foreign exchange payment services and consumer protection if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

moreover for existing and future payment options we offer to both our customers and suppliers we are and may increasingly be subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes such as the eea’s revised payment services directive “psd2” which came into effect on january 1 2021 psd2 imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a payment transaction which could result in significant costs to us and our suppliers and reduce the ease of use of our payments options 

thirdparty payment service providers we rely on agreements with thirdparty service providers to process our voluminous customer credit and debit card transactions and for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition these agreements may allow the payment processors to withhold a significant amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by provider or suspend their processing services an imposition of a holdback or suspension of payment processing services by one or more of our payment processors could materially reduce our liquidity further the software and services provided by payment processors may fail to meet our expectations contain errors or vulnerabilities be compromised or experience outages any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to process payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

payment card networks the payment card networks such as visa mastercard and american express may increase the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks and may impose special fees or assessments on such transactions our payment processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us which could significantly increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our financial performance 

in addition the payment card networks have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept payment cards and include payment card association operating rules the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss moreover the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with or costly to implement if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments and be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to paymentsrelated fraud risks 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” in addition the payment card networks have rules around acceptable charge back ratios accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms such as historically occurred with the introduction of smartphones tablet computers and inhome assistants and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity in addition we have not broadly adopted certain protective capabilities across our platform such as mobile applicationbased 

table of contents 

multifactor authentication or thirdparty identify verification which approach could result in significantly increased fraudulent activity on our platform in the future 

if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs we may also be subject to significant fines and higher transaction fees or payment card networks may revoke our access to their networks meaning we would be unable to continue to accept card payments either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial positions 

in addition we may be subject to fraudulent supplier schemes for example when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we have numerous significant commercial arrangements with business partners and we rely on thirdparty service providers for a broad ranges of key services including both external customerfacing services such as customer support and booking fulfillment and internal services related to our operations technology development and infrastructure if these partners or service providers fail to meet our requirements or legal or regulatory requirements it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions likewise if one of our thirdparty service providers were to cease operations face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and disruption to our own business operations until an equivalent alternative could be sourced or developed any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance additionally due to the covid19 pandemic most of our employees are working remotely which may strain the ability of certain technology vendors to support the increased demand for services such as remote connectivity 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences as well as the regulatory and tax landscapes of each country into which we expand could slow our growth or prevent our ability to compete effectively in certain markets for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins if the proportion of our overall revenue from these markets grow over time additionally some countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that make competition by foreign companies costly or operationally difficult in those markets 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 

table of contents 



acquisitions investments divestitures or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in divested or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future success may depend in part on such transactions any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to such transactions that may have a material impact on our business are 

table of contents 

moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired private companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

we rely on the performance of our employees and if we are unable to retain or motivate our current employees or hire retain and motivate qualified new personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization competition for wellqualified employees is intense in almost all categories including for software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals and in all geographies the competition for talent is also exacerbated by an increased willingness of certain companies to offer flexible and remote working policies which expands the pool of candidates from which our competitors may attract talent this could continue in the future due to other companies recruiting and hiring our employees an actual or perceived slower pace of recovery of the travel industry as a result of the covid19 pandemic than other industries and other factors beyond our control if we do not succeed in attracting and retaining wellqualified employees our business our ability to execute and innovate our competitive position and results of operations would be adversely affected the current labor market is highly competitive and our personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent are increasing and may increase further which may adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive peter kern our vice chairman and chief executive officer as well as other members of our travel leadership team are critical to the overall management of the company expedia group cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr kern or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our plans to increase our operational efficiencies and our restructuring efforts may adversely affect our business 

during 2019 we initiated a restructuring of portions of our global workforce in an effort to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and the operation of our overall businesses in february 2020 we announced our intention to pursue operating cost savings by further simplifying our organization streamlining priorities and operating more efficiently due to the covid19 pandemic we implemented certain additional operational cost saving actions in 2020 and 2021 that went beyond what had been originally planned 

the operational efficiencies and restructuring actions we have undertaken in the past several years as well as future actions may not achieve our targeted operational cost savings improvements and efficiencies which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements andor cost reductions these risks include among others higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans management distraction from ongoing business activities failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans damage to our reputation and brand image additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency adverse effects on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees any of these consequences could adversely impact our business 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages letters of credit and for certain of our transactions the receipt and holding of traveler payments and subsequent remittance of a portion of those payments to travel suppliers as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2021 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 37 billion and held term deposits of approximately 353 million additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 301 million as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2021 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 17 billion the fair value of which was an asset of approximately 3 million we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these term deposits or forward contracts our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets held may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or 

table of contents 

bankruptcy proceeding and the receipt and remittance of payments via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease i n addition we face significant credit risk and potential payment delays with respect to nonfinancial contract counterparties including our expedia business services and vrbo partners which may be exacerbated by economic downturns the realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar brazilian real and swiss franc currencies that revalue our cash flows monetary assets and liabilities and translate our foreign subsidiary financial results to us dollars in particular we face exposure related to fluctuations in accommodation revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay as well as the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

legal and regulatory risks 

our alternative accommodations business is subject to legal and regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

our alternative accommodations business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments that affect the alternative accommodation industry and the ability of companies like us to list those alternative accommodations online for example certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit or limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or that regulate platforms’ ability to list alternative accommodations including prohibiting the listing of unlicensed properties other domestic and foreign jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm rentals in addition many of the laws that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and the alternative accommodation industry which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

these new and evolving regulatory schemes add significant compliance risks to our business including the risk of fines for noncompliance as well as substantial internal costs and the allocation of resources to develop new internal compliance systems and processes these obligations include verification of registration status of properties and the ongoing provision of information to governments about shortterm rental owners and operators and requirements to withhold and report taxable income to governments we may also remove properties from our websites if alternative accommodation owners or operators do not provide information we require to comply with applicable regulations 

we are not in a position to eliminate risks such as personal injury robbery or other harm at alternative accommodation properties and we do not inspect or verify safety such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detectors which could result in claims of liability based on events occurring at properties listed on our platforms 

we have also experienced instances where properties listed on our sites are copied and travelers booking these properties outside of our websites are the subject of fraudulent requests for payment in other cases travelers have been asked to pay for their booking of properties listed on our website directly to the alternative accommodation operator and outside of our website resulting in loss of revenue for us and increased risk of fraud for the traveler 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our alternative accommodations business including impacting our reputation and brand as well as the results of operations of our alternative accommodations business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia group’s operations and financial results 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their enforcement of such laws rules and regulations resulting in increased audit activity and audit assessments as well as legislation including new taxes on our technology platform and digital services as such potential tax liabilities may exceed our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices and incur additional cost to comply any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits andor levied assessments asserting we are required to collect andor remit state and local sales or use taxes value added taxes or other transactional taxes related to our travel facilitation services including the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

in the past we have been required and in the future may be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments prior to contesting their validity a description of ongoing tax inquiries or audits in “paytoplay” jurisdictions is included in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

judgment and estimation are required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation taxing authorities may disagree with our crossjurisdictional transfer pricing including the amount or support for such charges we believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits may be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities potentially including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of domestic or international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations

many of the statutory laws rules and regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were enacted before the growth of the digital economy certain jurisdictions have enacted new tax laws rules and regulations directed at taxing the digital economy and multinational businesses if existing tax laws rules or regulations change by amendment or new legislation with respect to occupancy tax sales tax valueadded taxes goods and services tax digital services tax withholding taxes revenuebased taxes unclaimed property or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy or multinational businesses the result of these changes could increase our tax liabilities potential outcomes include prospectively or retrospectively additional responsibility to collect and remit indirect taxes including on behalf of travel suppliers imposition of interest and penalties multiple levels of taxation and an obligation to comply with information reporting laws or regulations requiring us to provide information about travel suppliers customers and transactions on our technology platform the outcome of these changes may have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance demand for our products and services may decrease if we pass on such costs to the consumer tax reporting and compliance obligations may result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decide not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions 

taxing authorities have focused legislative efforts on tax reform transparency and base erosion prevention as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in various jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in several jurisdictions in general changes in tax laws may affect our effective tax rate increase our tax liabilities and impact the value of deferred tax balances 

since releasing its interim report in 2018 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has proposed measures to address corporate tax challenges of the digital economy these measures include a twopillar approach endorsed by member jurisdictions globally that focuses on nexus profit allocation and minimum tax proposals the oecd continues to develop the technical and implementation details of the approach for future adoption by jurisdictions as the oecd continues its work several territories have enacted or proposed measures to impose new digital services taxes on companies however certain territories have agreed to withdraw these digital service taxes once the oecd’s twopillar approach has been implemented these taxes are incremental to taxes historically incurred by the company and result in taxation of the same revenue in multiple countries the enacted and proposed measures may have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

our tax liabilities in the future may also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of revenue and earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax balances or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with relevant governmental authorities and legislators as appropriate to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws rules and regulations however due to the increasing pace of legislative changes and the scale of our business activities any substantial changes in tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the taxes we are required to pay our financial position and results of operations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and disputes involving taxes personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions has been and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and the outcomes of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems in many areas of our business including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity marketing communications procurement payments tax collection and remittance fraud detection and administration which we must continuously improve and upgrade 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings cloud computing the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes including new devices services and home assistants and developing technologies have and will continue to require new and costly investments transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers for example we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as aws 

we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites as well as backoffice application functionality to new technology platforms such as cloud computing services to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site features 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including through spyware viruses phishing denial of service and similar attacks by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent in addition as we continue to migrate legacy systems to new or existing information technology systems we increase the risk of system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon  including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers  and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our customers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses we also face risks related to our ability to maintain data and hardware security with respect to remote working during the covid19 pandemic 

no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time 

in addition as a result of our efforts to migrate key portions of our platform functionality to aws we now depend on the availability of aws’s services and any incident affecting aws’s infrastructure and availability which have occurred a number of times in the recent past could adversely affect the availability of our platform and our ability to serve our customers which

could in turn damage our reputation with current and potential customers expose us to liability result in substantial costs for remediation cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business financial condition or results of operations we may also incur significant costs for using alternative hosting sources or taking other actions in preparation for or in reaction to events that compromise the aws services we use 

we process store and use customer supplier and employee personal financial and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use theft or destruction 

there are numerous laws regarding the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal financial and other data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of our businesses 

any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with privacyrelated legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use theft or destruction of such data may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans in addition such an event could result in violations of applicable us and international laws governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation 

we are subject to privacy regulations and compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny some us states including california have passed comprehensive privacy legislation or are considering privacy legislation in addition the general data protection regulation or gdpr that went into effect in the european union in may 2018 requires companies to implement and remain compliant with regulations regarding the handling of personal data at least 12 additional countries in asia eastern europe and latin america have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted although we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to comply with the gdpr and other privacy laws and regulations the number and variety of regulations combined with our multiproduct multibrand global businesses could nevertheless result in compliance failures  failure to meet any of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or legal liability adverse publicity andor damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

governance risks 

mr diller may be deemed to beneficially own shares representing approximately 27 of the outstanding voting power of expedia group 

as of december 31 2021 mr diller may be deemed to have beneficially owned 100 of expedia group’s outstanding class b common stock representing approximately 27 of the total voting power of all shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock outstanding in the future mr diller’s ownership percentage in expedia group could increase if he buys additional shares of expedia group common stock in open market purchases or otherwise or if expedia group repurchases shares of its common stock 

mr diller is also currently the chairman of expedia group’s board of directors and senior executive of expedia group expedia group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the chairman of the board may only be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of at least 80 of the entire board of directors which provision may not be amended altered changed or repealed or any provision inconsistent therewith adopted without the approval of at least 1 80 of the entire board of directors and 2 80 of the voting power of expedia group’s outstanding voting securities voting together as a single class 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power mr diller is in a position to influence and potentially control significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets additionally in the future another holder of the original shares might have such a position of influence by virtue of ownership interests in the original shares this concentrated ownership position could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to expedia group stockholders

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia group management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iacinteractivecorp or iac each of ms clinton and mr von furstenberg also serves as a member of the board of directors of both expedia group and iac these overlapping relationships could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for the directors or officers when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia group mr diller in particular may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between the companies 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia group who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia group because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group 

increased focus on our environmental social and governance esg responsibilities have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks and may adversely impact our reputation employee retention and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us 

institutional individual and other investors proxy advisory services regulatory authorities consumers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on esg practices of companies as we look to respond to evolving standards for identifying measuring and reporting esg metrics our efforts may result in a significant increase in costs and may nevertheless not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and evolving standards or regulatory requirements which may negatively impact our financial results our reputation our ability to attract or retain employees our attractiveness as a service provider investment or business partner or expose us to government enforcement actions private litigation and actions by stockholders or stakeholders

competition and consumer matters 

table of contents 

over the last several years the online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities “ncas” particularly in europe 

matters relating to contractual provisions with accommodations providers 

expedia group companies are or have been involved in a number of investigations by european ncas predominately related to whether certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia group entities and accommodation providers sometimes also referred to as “most favored nation” or “mfn” provisions are anticompetitive 

with effect from august 1 2015 expedia group companies waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with european hotel partners while the expedia group companies maintain that their parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law these waivers were nevertheless implemented as a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis following the implementation of the expedia group companies waivers nearly all ncas in europe announced either the closure of their investigation or inquiries involving expedia group companies or a decision not to open an investigation or inquiry involving expedia group companies however certain related matters remain ongoing including cases brought by the german federal cartel office and the italian competition authority as well as a review by a working group of 10 european ncas and the european commission legislative bodies in france austria italy and belgium have also adopted domestic antiparity clause legislation which we believe in each case violates both eu and national legal principles in addition a motion requesting the swiss government to take action on narrow price parity has been adopted in the swiss parliament the swiss government is now in the process of drafting legislation implementing the motion 

a number of ncas outside of europe have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including expedia group companies in certain of these jurisdictions including australia brazil hong kong south korea and new zealand the concerns were resolved with expedia group companies’ waiver of certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with hotel partners in the respective jurisdictions in other cases expedia group companies are in ongoing discussions with ncas for example in april 2019 the japan fair trade commission “jftc” launched an investigation into certain practices of a number of online travel companies including expedia group companies expedia group is cooperating with the jftc

regulatory authorities in europe including the uk competition and markets authority or “cma” australia and elsewhere have also initiated legal proceedings andor undertaken market studies inquiries or investigations relating to online marketplaces and how information is presented to consumers using those marketplaces including practices such as search results rankings and algorithms discount claims  disclosure of charges and availability and similar messaging in response we agreed to offer certain voluntary undertakings with respect to the presentation of information on certain of our uk and european union consumerfacing websites in order to address the regulatory authorities’ concerns 

on august 23 2018 the australian competition and consumer commission or accc instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law or acl relating to trivago’s advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s australian site trivago’s strikethrough pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivagos australian website the matter went to trial in september 2019 and on january 20 2020 the australian federal court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the acl on october 18 and 19 2021 the australian federal court heard submissions from the parties regarding penalties and other orders in its submissions the accc proposed a penalty of at least au 90 million and an injunction restraining trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the australian federal court to be in contravention of the acl trivago submitted that an appropriate penalty for the court to impose would be in the order of up to au 15 million the parties await a ruling we recorded an estimated probable loss of approximately  11 million with respect to these proceedings in a previous period an estimate for the reasonable possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made 

we are cooperating with regulators in the investigations described above where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect such actions will have on our business industry practices or online commerce more generally

trends 

the covid19 pandemic and measures to contain the virus including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders have had a significant negative impact on the travel industry covid19 has negatively impacted consumer sentiment and consumer’s ability to travel and many of our supply partners particularly airlines and hotels continue to operate at reduced service levels 

as the spread of the virus has been contained to varying degrees in certain countries during different times travel restrictions have been lifted and consumers have become more comfortable traveling particularly to domestic locations this led to a moderation of the declines in travel bookings and in cancellation rates at certain points in 2021 however travel bookings remain below and cancellation rates still remain elevated compared to precovid levels due largely to the most recent omicron variant 

the degree of containment of the virus and the recovery in travel has varied country by country during the recovery period there have been instances where cases of covid19 have started to increase again after a period of decline which in some cases impacted the recovery of travel in certain countries additionally there continues to be uncertainty over the impact of the omicron or other new variants of the virus including the efficacy of the vaccines against such variants which has contributed and may continue to contribute to delays in economic recovery covid19 has also had broader economic impacts including an increase in unemployment levels and reduction in economic activity globally which if covid19 starts to increase again could lead to a reduction in consumer or business spending on travel activities which may negatively impact the timing and level of a recovery in travel demand broader sustained negative economic impacts could also put strain on our suppliers business and service partners which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions 

our financial and operating results for 2021 were significantly impacted due to the continued decrease in travel demand related to covid19 the full duration and total impact of covid19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and in particular our business 

additionally further healthrelated events political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and natural disasters are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

prior to the onset of covid19 we began to execute a cost savings initiative aimed at simplifying the organization and increasing efficiency following the onset of covid19 we accelerated execution on several of these cost savings initiatives and took additional actions to reduce costs to help mitigate the impact to demand from covid19 and reduce our monthly cash usage while some cost actions during covid19 are temporary and intended to minimize cash usage during this disruption we expect to continue to benefit from the majority of the savings when business conditions return to more normalized levels in 2021 we successfully achieved the previously outlined annualized runrate fixed cost savings of 700 to 750 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 exit rate as well as the greater than 200 million in variable costs savings at 2019 volume levels we also believe we have improved our marketing efficiency and continue to evaluate additional opportunities to increase efficiency and improve operational effectiveness across the company 

table of contents 

as a result of these cost savings initiatives we expect adjusted ebitda margins to increase compared to historical levels when revenue returns to more normalized levels

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet has continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures online penetration is higher in the us and european markets with online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions historically lagging behind those regions the emerging market penetration rates increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business while also attracting many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google evidenced by continued product enhancements including new trip planning features for users and the integration of its various travel products into the google travel offering as well as further prioritizing its own products in search results competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom owned by booking holdings trivago in which expedia group owns a majority interest as well as tripadvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools further airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services in addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry businesses such as airbnb vrbo previously homeaway which expedia group acquired in december 2015 and bookingcom owned by booking holdings have emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market many other competitors including vacation rental metasearch players continue to emerge in this space which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their websites 

the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia group facilitates both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agencyonly contracts as well as our hybrid etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

in 2020 we shifted to managing our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our retail segment to optimize results for the company and making decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment over time intense competition historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins during 2020 we increased our focus on opportunities to differentiate brands across customer and geographic segments increase marketing efficiency drive a higher proportion of transactions through direct channels and ultimately improve the balance of transaction growth and profitability for more detail see part i item 1a risk factors  we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing” and “our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally” 

lodging 

lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2021 lodging accounted for 75 as a result of the impact on travel demand from the covid19 outbreak room nights grew 35 in 2021 as compared to a decline 55 in 2020 and a growth of 11 in 2019 the timing of recovery in consumer sentiment on travel and on staying at hotels will be a factor in our level of room night growth and as noted above we expect that to vary by country adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites decreased 1 in 2019 increased 3 in 2020 and increased 20 in 2021 during 2021 and 2020 the increase in adrs for our vrbo business remained elevated compared to years prior to the covid19 outbreak vrbo carries a higher adr than hotels and has accounted for a higher percentage of room nights due to the faster recovery and shift to alternative accommodations during these periods 

the uncertain environment as a result of covid19 including travel restrictions and shifts in consumer behavior the mix of our lodging bookings across geographies and types of accommodations and general variability in supply and demand make it difficult to predict adr trends in the nearterm 

table of contents 

as of december 31 2021 our global lodging marketplace had approximately 3 million lodging properties available including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings and approximately 875000 hotels 

hotel we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings after rolling out etp globally over a period of several years during which time we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs our relationships and overall economics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment however due to covid19 current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states are at reduced levels in addition other factors could pressure adr trends including the continued growth in hotel supply in recent years and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory further while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups in the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on thirdparty websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi 

alternative accommodations with our acquisition of vrbo previously homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group vrbo has transitioned from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology vrbo offers hosts subscriptionbased listing or payperbooking service models it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings in addition we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global retail services as well as directly add alternative accommodation listings to our offerings to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers 

air 

the airline industry has been dramatically impacted by covid19 as a result of the significantly reduced air travel demand due to government travel restrictions and the impact on consumer sentiment related to covid19 airlines have been operating with less capacity and passenger traffic has declined significantly while we experienced some improvement in air bookings during 2021 versus 2020 it continues to lag lodging bookings and is still meaningfully below 2019 levels the recovery in air travel remains difficult to predict and may not correlate with the recovery in lodging demand according to the transportation security administration “tsa” air traveler 7day average throughput declined 95 in april 2020 compared to prior year levels the declines moderated to approximately 50 by the end of 2020 and further improved in 2021 with throughput down approximately 20 at the end of the year compared to 2019 levels 

in addition there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue given current volatility it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine certain supply agreements renew and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets 

air ticket volumes increased 7 in 2019 declined 63 in 2020 and increased 43 during 2021 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2021 air accounted for 3 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch website and expedia group media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2021 we generated 603 million of advertising and media revenue a 49 increase from 2020 representing 7 of our total worldwide revenue given the decline in travel demand related to covid19 online travel agencies dramatically reduced marketing spend including on trivago and given the uncertain duration and impact of covid19 it is difficult to predict when spend will recover to normalized levels in response in 2020 trivago significantly reduced its marketing spend and took additional actions to lower operating expenses which continued throughout 2021 we expect trivago to continue to experience pressure on revenue and profit until online travel agencies and other hotel suppliers see consumer demand that warrants increasing in their advertising spend with trivago 

table of contents 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter since revenue for most of our travel services including merchant and agency hotel is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business historically vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago have typically been experienced in the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring summer and winter holiday travel as a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the growth of our international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix including the growth of vrbo may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

impacts from covid19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings revenue profit and cash flows during 2020 and 2021 significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes particularly in the first half of 2020 resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels booking and travel trends improved during the second half of 2020 and in 2021 this resulted in working capital benefits and positive cash flow more akin to typical historical trends it remains difficult to forecast the seasonality for the upcoming quarters given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

deferred loyalty rewards 

we currently offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our travelers such as our hotelscom rewards program our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on various brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation 

table of contents 

packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide in 2021 we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform spanning all products and global brands as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points net of expected breakage as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors including fluctuations in reward value product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred during 2020 as a result of the significant turmoil related to covid19 we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform multiple interim impairment assessments in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and if applicable record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units except for trivago which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivagos stock price a level 1 input adjusted for an estimated control premium 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 

table of contents 

over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

for additional information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2021 and 2020 see note 3 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense 

we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates all deferred income taxes are classified as longterm on our consolidated balance sheets 

we account for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority including resolution of any appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of the position if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy and other taxes  some states and localities impose taxes eg transient occupancy accommodation tax sales tax andor business privilege tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in most jurisdictions we do not collect or remit taxes nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services we are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe are similarly not liable for such taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

table of contents 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 10000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in eight lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes andor ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

for additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 50 million as of december 31 2021 and 58 million as of december 31 2020

certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

other jurisdictions we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities some of which including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes may impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court

segments 

we have the following reportable segments retail b2b and trivago our retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world vrbo orbitz travelocity wotif group ebookers cheaptickets hotwirecom carrentalscom and expedia cruises our b2b segment is comprised of our expedia business services organization including expedia partner solutions which offers private label and cobranded products to make travel services available to travelers through thirdparty company branded websites and through its sale in november 2021 egencia a fullservice travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are reduced for cancellations and refunds revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

1 trivago which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transactionbased websites does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin however thirdparty revenue from trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin 

the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2021 compared to 2020 reflected improvements in the travel environment 

revenue margin in 2021 was lower than 2020 due in part to significant lodging cancellations in the prior year period which reduced gross bookings creating an unusual mix of bookings and revenue 

results of operations 

revenue 

similar to the gross bookings increase revenue increased 65 in 2021 compared to 2020 our retail b2b and trivago segments revenue all increased compared to prior year with the growth reflecting improvements in travel trends during 2021 

 

1 includes thirdparty revenue from trivago as well as our transactionbased websites 

lodging revenue increased 59 in 2021 on a 35 increase in room nights stayed and an 18 increase in revenue per room night across hotel and alternative accommodations revenue per room night in 2021 benefited from higher adrs driven by an increase in regional rates and a higher mix of us hotels 

air revenue increased 141 in 2021 driven by an increase in air tickets sold of 43 as air travel demand improved as well as the prior year impact of certain significant covid19 related accruals that did not repeat in 2021 

advertising and media revenue increased 49 in 2021 due to increases at both trivago and expedia group media solutions all other revenue which includes car rental insurance destination services fee revenue related to our corporate travel business through egencias sale in november 2021 and bodybuildingcom through its sale in may 2020 increased 103 in 2021 from growth in travel insurance products as well as car 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

the increase in merchant revenue in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in merchant hotel revenue driven by an increase in room nights stayed an increase in vrbo merchant alternative accommodations revenue and the growth in travel insurance products 

the increase in agency revenue in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in agency hotel car and air revenue 

advertising media and other increased 12 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue partially offset by declines related to our prior year sale of bodybuildingcom and certain miscellaneous other declines 

in the below discussion we reclassified certain prior period information to conform to the current period presentation primarily related to the classification of licensing and maintenance costs within our operating expenses these prior period reclassifications did not alter our discussion of year over year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 which can be referenced in our 2020 form 10k for additional information see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of direct costs to support our customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors credit card processing including merchant fees fraud and chargebacks and other costs primarily including data center and cloud costs to support our websites supplier operations destination supply certain transactional level taxes costs related to bodybuildingcom during our period of ownership as well as related personnel and overhead costs including stockbased compensation 

cost of revenue decreased 127 million during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense which was significantly elevated in 2020 due to the initial impacts of covid19 decreased customer service and personnel costs and the absence of expenses related to bodybuildingcom which was disposed of in the second quarter of 2020 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in merchant fees resulting from recovering transaction volumes 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our various brands and global supply organization as well as stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses increased 17 billion during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in direct costs as marketing spend increased in response to improved demand the change in indirect costs reflect lower personnel costs in connection with previously announced cost savings initiatives partially offset by higher stockbased compensation expense of 48 million 

technology and content 

technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead including stockbased compensation as well as other costs including cloud expense and licensing and maintenance expense 

technology and content expense increased 6 million for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflecting higher stockbased compensation of 48 million partially offset by lower license and maintenance expense as well as personnel and related costs in connection with previously announced cost savings initiatives 

table of contents 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions and related stockbased compensation as well as fees for external professional services 

general and administrative expense increased 116 million in 2021 compared to 2020 mainly due to an increase in stockbased compensation of 107 million 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation decreased 24 million in 2021 compared to 2020 amortization of intangible assets decreased 55 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets or sold entities as well as the impact of definitelived intangible impairments in the prior year 

impairment of goodwill intangible and other longterm assets 

during 2021 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 14 million and intangible and other longterm asset impairment charges of 6 million related to our b2b segment during 2020 as a result of the significant negative impact related to covid19 which has had a severe effect on the entire global travel industry we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 799 million as well as intangible asset impairment charges of 175 million see note 3 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other primarily consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other for year ended december 31 2021 included a charge for certain other legal reserves mostly offset by net reductions to our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes during 2020 we recorded a 25 million gain in relation to a legal settlement which was partially offset by changes in our reserves related to occupancy and other matters 

restructuring and related reorganization charges 

in 2020 we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies which have resulted in headcount reductions and office consolidations as a result we recognized 55 million and 231 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2021 and 2020 we continue to actively evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we may incur additional reorganization charges

operating income loss 

in 2021 we had operating income of 186 million compared to operating loss of 27 billion in 2020 the improvement in 2021 was primarily due to growth in revenue in excess of operating costs as well as the absence in 2021 of the significant prior year goodwill and intangible impairment charges mentioned above 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

 

1 includes operating results of egencia through its sale in november 2021 

2 includes immaterial operating results of bodybuildingcom subsequent to our acquisition in july 2019 through its sale in may 2020 

3 adjusted ebitda is a nongaap measure see definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda below for more information 

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric see note 19 — segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income loss attributable to expedia group inc for the periods presented above during the fourth quarter of 2021 we consolidated our divisional finance teams into one global finance organization which resulted in the reclassification of expenses from retail and b2b into our corporate function we have reclassified prior period segment information to conform to our current period presentation 

our retail b2b and trivago segments all experienced improvements in adjusted ebitda in 2021 as a result of the recovering travel environment as well as impacts of the costs saving initiatives implemented in 2020 

our retail b2b and trivago segment adjusted ebitda significantly declined during 2020 compared to 2019 resulting from impacts of the covid19 pandemic which drove meaningful revenue declines partially offset by a decline in direct sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue unallocated overhead costs decreased 130 million during 2020 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses 

interest income and expense 

interest income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of lower rates of return interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 largely as a result of prior year interest expense related to the outstanding revolving credit facility 

table of contents 

as a result of debt refinancing transactions during 2021 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 280 million which included the payment of early payment premiums and fees as well as the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs see note 7 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

gain loss on sale of business net 

in 2021 we had a net gain on sale of businesses of 456 million compared to a net loss on sale of businesses of 13 million in 2020 in november 2021 we completed the sale of egencia to gbt and as a result we recognized a 401 million gain on the sale additionally in 2021 we completed the sale of certain of our smaller businesses within our retail segment which resulted in net gains of 57 million for additional information on these and other transactions see note 16 – divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

during 2020 losses on minority equity investments net included 134 million of impairment losses related to a minority investment as well as 6 million of marktomarket losses related to our publicly traded marketable equity investment despegar see note 3 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2021 was higher than the 21 federal statutory income tax rate due to excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation release of valuation allowance and research and experimentation credits partially offset by nondeductible compensation measured against a pretax loss our effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the 21 federal statutory income tax rate due to valuation allowances and nondeductible impairments measured against a pretax loss 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities during the fourth quarter of 2019 the internal revenue service “irs” issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years the proposed adjustments would increase our us taxable income by 696 million which would result in federal tax of approximately 244 million subject to interest we do not agree with the position of the irs we filed a protest with the irs for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and appeals returned our case to exam for further review we are also under examination by the irs for our 2014 to 2016 tax years subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years 

for additional information see note 10 — income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations we 

table of contents 

endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters which may ultimately be settled in cash and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above in the legal proceedings section as well as the notes to the financial statements the nongaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to expedia group inc adjusted for 1 net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 provision for income taxes 3 total other expenses net 4 stockbased compensation expense including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans 5 acquisitionrelated impacts including i amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment ii gains losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements if any and iii upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree if any 6 certain other items including restructuring 7 items included in legal reserves occupancy tax and other 8 that portion of gains losses on revenue hedging activities that are included in other net that relate to revenue recognized in the period and 9 depreciation 

the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future ongoing performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments in addition we believe that by excluding certain items such as stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated impacts adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 

the reconciliation of net income loss attributable to expedia group inc to adjusted ebitda is as follows 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations cash available under our credit facilities as well as our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 43 billion and 34 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 our credit facilities were essentially untapped at december 31 2021 and 2020 

as of december 31 2021 the total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 676 million 375 million in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries and 301 million in majorityowned subsidiaries the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the unites states and for which future distributions could be taxable was 69 million as of 

table of contents 

december 31 2021 the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the us federal income tax consequences of these earnings was 18 million as of december 31 2021 

managing our balance sheet prudently and maintaining appropriate liquidity have been high priorities during the covid19 pandemic in 2020 in order to best position the company to navigate our temporary working capital changes and depressed revenue we took a number of actions to bolster our liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in 2021 we continued certain of these actions including suspension of our share repurchases and quarterly common stock dividends but with an improvement in market condition and trends in the current year we were able to complete the following actions to reduce our cost of capital 

• 0 convertible notes issuance in february 2021 we completed our private placement of 1 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured 0 convertible senior notes due 2026 the “convertible notes” the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes was approximately 983 million after deducting debt issuance costs the convertible notes will mature on february 15 2026 unless earlier converted redeemed or repurchased the convertible notes will not bear regular interest the convertible notes have an initial conversion rate of 39212 shares of common stock of expedia group with a par value 00001 per share per 1000 principal amount of convertible notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately 25502 per share of our common stock the conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends and payment of cash dividends 

• 295 senior notes issuance in march 2021 we privately placed 1 billion of senior unsecured notes that are due in march 2031 that bear interest at 295 the “295 notes” the 295 notes were issued at a price of 99081 of the aggregate principal amount interest is payable semiannually in arrears in march and september of each year beginning september 15 2021 and the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on certain ratings events the net proceeds from the issuance of the 295 notes was approximately 982 million after deducting the discount and debt issuance costs 

• extinguishment of high cost debt in march 2021 we used the net proceeds from the convertible notes and 295 notes and completed the redemption of all of our outstanding 70 notes as well as settled the tender offer to purchase 956 million in aggregate principal of our 625 notes which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of 280 million in 2021 comprised of early payment premiums and fees associated with the tender offer as well as the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs 

• repayment of preferred stock  in may 2021 we completed the prepayment of 50 of the outstanding series a preferred stock at a price equal to 103 of the preference amount plus accrued and unpaid distributions as to the redemption dates using cash onhand in october 2021 we prepaid the remaining 50 of the outstanding series a preferred stock under the same terms as the may prepayment using cash onhand 

on february 1 2022 notice was provided to the holders of the company’s 25 notes due 2022 that the company will redeem all of the €650 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes on march 3 2022 the redemption price for the notes will be equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2021 moody’s rating was baa3 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “negative” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited access to capital markets and interest rates on the 625 notes issued in may 2020 the 36 and 4625 notes issued in july 2020 as well as the 295 notes issued in march 2021 will increase which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in note 7 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant lodging business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us typically the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows generally during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative during 2020 impacts of covid19 disrupted our typical working 

table of contents 

capital trends significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes particularly in the first half of 2020 resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow although travel volumes remain materially lower than historic levels booking and travel trends normalized during the second half of 2020 and during 2021 have increased from 2020 levels resulting in working capital benefits and positive cash flow in the current period more akin to typical historical trends however it remains difficult to forecast the working capital trends for the upcoming quarters given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery 

prior to covid19 we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency in response to covid19 we took several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from covid19 and continue to improve our longterm cost structure in addition certain capital expenditures were deferred in 2020 including temporarily halting construction on several real estate projects in 2021 as economic conditions improved we substantially completed the construction of our new headquarters and the project was within the expected total project spend of approximately 900 million for 2022 we expect total capital expenditures for the full year to increase over 2021 spending levels 

our cash flows are as follows 

in 2021 net cash provided by operating activities was 37 billion compared to cash used in operating activities of 38 billion for 2020 in the prior year period impacts from the covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant use of cash to fund working capital changes and operating losses compared to a current year cash benefit from working capital the largest driver of the swing in working capital relates to a significant use of cash in the prior year for deferred merchant bookings as refunds for cancelled bookings exceeded new bookings compared to a meaningful increase in booking volumes and deferred merchant bookings in the current year period 

in 2021 668 million more cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net purchase of investments of 178 million in 2021 compared to net sales and maturities of investments of 476 million in 2020 partially offset by lower capital expenditures including those related to our new headquarters as our construction winds down 

cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily included payments of approximately 2 billion related to the extinguishment of debt and 12 billion for the redemption of preferred stock both discussed above as well as 165 million of cash paid for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and 67 million in preferred stock dividends these uses of cash were largely offset by approximately 2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 295 notes issued in february and march 2021 respectively as well as 503 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included 39 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in may and july 2020 11 billion of net proceeds from our private equity issuance as well as 319 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans these sources of cash were partially offset by the august 2020 repayment of 750 million of 595 notes cash paid to acquire shares of 425 million including the repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2020 and treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and cash dividend payments of 123 million 

our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors have authorized share repurchases under authorized programs as disclosed above these programs were temporarily halted in early 2020 but repurchases prior to that time were as follows 

   

1 amount excludes transaction costs 

table of contents 

as of december 31 2021 there were approximately 233 million shares remaining under prior repurchase authorizations there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases 

during 2021 while we didnt pay common stock dividends we did pay 67 million or 7496 per share of series a preferred stock of dividends on the series a preferred stock during 2020 the total dividend payment of 123 million included a common stock dividend of 034 per share for the first quarter of 2020 as well as 75 million or 6247 per share of series a preferred stock of dividends on the series a preferred stock at this time we do not expect to make future quarterly dividend payments on our common stock future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2021 of 177 million reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar during the year foreign exchange rate changes resulted in increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2020 of 61 million reflecting a net appreciation in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar during the year 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments our material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business 

• principal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments the company had senior notes and convertible notes as described in note 7 — debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of 85 billion with 735 million payable within 12 months based on current stated fixed rates and current exchange rates if applicable future interest payments associated with the senior notes total approximately 16 billion with approximately 304 million payable within 12 months 

• our operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations including imputed interest of 504 million with 91 million payable within 12 months and 

• purchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use the company had purchase obligations of 824 million with 589 million payable within 12 months 

in addition we had 275 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31 2021 for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 

see note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of december 31 2021 related to letters of credit and guarantees other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2021 

in our opinion our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs there can be no assurance however that the cost or availability of future borrowings including refinancings if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facilities derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 in september 2017 we issued 1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 38 in september 2019 we issued 125 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 325 in may 2020 we issued 2 billion of senior unsecured notes due may 2025 that bear interest at 625 of which 956 million in aggregate principal was subsequently repaid in 2021 in july 2020 we issued 500 million of senior unsecured notes due december 2023 that bear interest at 36 and 750 million of senior unsecured notes due august 2027 that bear interest at 4625 in march 2021 we issued 1 billion of senior unsecured notes due march 2031 that bear interest at 295 the 25 36 45 625 50 4625 38 325 and 295 senior unsecured notes are collectively the “senior notes” in february 2021 we issued 1 billion of convertible senior unsecured notes due february 2026 with a fixed rate of 0 the “convertible notes” as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates additionally the senior unsecured notes issued in may and july 2020 and march 2021 are subject to interest rate adjustments should our credit ratings be adjusted downwards which would result in increased interest expense in the future the total estimated fair value of our senior notes and convertible notes was approximately 92 billion and 91 billion as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes by approximately 200 million 

we maintain revolving credit facilities of 2 billion which bear interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities we had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china the united kingdom and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had a net forward asset of 3 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of 14 million included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities respectively we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 13 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2021 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 48 million 37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 71 million 2 million gain excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 34 million 34 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

covid19 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and is continuing to have an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry the various government measures implemented to contain the covid19 pandemic such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forgo their time outside of their homes initially led to unprecedented levels of cancellations and continues to have a negative impact on the number of new travel bookings while many countries have begun the process of vaccinating their residents against covid19 the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccines against new variants of the virus may contribute to delays in economic recovery 

overall the full duration and total impact of covid19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and in particular our business going forward 

market opportunity and business strategy 

expedia group is one of the world’s largest online travel companies yet our gross bookings represent a singledigit percentage of total worldwide travel spending highlighting the size of our market opportunity phocuswright estimated global travel spending inclusive of alternative accommodations at approximately 19 trillion in 2020 prior to the onset of covid19 with an increasing share booked through online channels each year

leverage our platform over the last year expedia group shifted to a platform operating model with more centralized technology product data engineering and data science teams building services and capabilities that are leveraged across our business units to serve our end customers and provide valueadd services to our travel suppliers this model enables us to 

deliver more scalable services and operate more efficiently all of our transactionbased businesses share and benefit from our platform infrastructure including customer servicing and support data centers search capabilities and transaction processing functions including payment processing and fraud operations 

as we continue to evolve our platform infrastructure our focus is on developing technical capabilities that support various travel products while using common applications and frameworks we believe this strategy will enable us to build in parallel because of simpler standard architecture ship products faster create more innovative solutions and achieve greater scale over time as we enable domains around application development frameworks we believe we can unlock additional platform service opportunities beyond our internal brands and other business travel partners 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by our virtual agent platform telephone or email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse contact centers our contact centers are located in several countries throughout the world we invested significantly in our contact center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our contact center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward in addition we have continued to invest in our conversation platform which leverages technology and artificial intelligence to provide online customer service options and selfservice capabilities to our customers through our websites and apps 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have 24hour monitoring and engineering support these data centers have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities additionally we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model 

• merchant model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms alternative accommodations airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings the majority of our merchant transactions relate to lodging bookings 

• agency model under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler and 

• advertising model under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings across several of our transactionbased websites as well as on our majorityowned metasearch site trivago 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we had total revenue of 52 billion with merchant agency and advertising accounting for 63 24 and 13 of total revenue respectively 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia group in advance under our merchant model expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay under the agency model hotel collect 

in addition through various of our expedia groupbranded and other multiproduct websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately travelers typically select packages based on the total package price or by purchasing one product and receiving a discounted price to attach additional products the use of the merchant travel components in packages and multiproduct purchases enable us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and 

increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers and customers that come directly to our websites we now manage our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our retail segment to optimize results for the company and making decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media websites brand advertising through online and offline channels loyalty programs mobile apps and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include hotelscom rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia®rewards on over 40 brand expedia points of sale as well as orbitz rewards on orbitzcom the cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing several of our branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia hotelscom or vrbo cobranded offering or a private label website our expedia partner solutions business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

travel suppliers 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies property owners and managers large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines destination service providers and other travel partners we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

we developed proprietary technology to assist hotel suppliers in managing pricing and marketing their supply our “direct connect” technology allows hotels to upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems and to automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers proprietary marketing tools assist hotels in tailoring demand to their requirements and our revenue management product provides pricing insight based on expedia group data and analytics our suite of white label website offerings power hotel package and meeting space booking on suppliers own websites 

in addition vrbos alternative accommodation listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers which enables them to manage an availability calendar reservations inquiries and the content of the listing as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia group and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia group is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators 

and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation websites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property and appurtenant rights including our patents trademarks copyright rights domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are important components of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands domain names and website urls software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that support and make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate and necessary respectively we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions and obtaining licenses in patents as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us we also protect some inventions and methods by maintaining them as trade secrets either because it provides superior and potentially longertermed protection or because the invention is not patentable but provides us with a competitive advantage 

in connection with our copyrightable content we post and institute procedures under the digital millennium copyright act and similar host privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs text and other content uploaded by users however differences between statutes limitations on immunity and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or 

merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the alternative accommodation industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

in international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

we are also subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa came into force in january 2020 which applies enhanced data protection requirements in the state of california similar to those that have existed since 2018 under the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr similar laws are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions 

compliance with these laws rules and regulation has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods however certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements may relate to our business in the future

covid19 response 

the covid19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented disruption to the global travel industry as the impact of the pandemic spread globally in 2020 our employees banded together and responded quickly to widespread travel cancellations and significant spikes in customer support call volumes at the same time substantially all of our offices were closed to protect the health of our employees who transitioned to working from their homes subsequently we have opened certain of our global offices where it is safe to do so we continue to actively monitor regional health guidance from local governments as it pertains to potential office openings and closures the impact of the global pandemic also resulted in further headcount reductions through the course of 2020 as well as the implementation of furloughs and reduced work week programs for select impacted volumebased teams we also took a number of actions to provide additional support to our employees during the pandemic including 

• a temporary voluntary reduced work week program for employees who are parents and caregivers or who have other personal needs

 part i item 1a risk factors   

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities if any of the following risks occur our business andor financial performance could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

covid19 pandemic and travel industry risks 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on the travel industry and our business financial performance and liquidity position 

the covid19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and is continuing to have an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry in response to the pandemic the governments of many countries states cities and other geographic regions have implemented containment measures such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forgo their time outside of their homes governments may continue implementing containment measures in response to new variants of the virus individuals’ ability to travel has been curtailed through border closures mandated travel restrictions and limited operations of hotels and airlines and may be further limited through additional voluntary or mandated closures of travelrelated businesses while many countries have begun the process of vaccinating their residents against covid19 the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants of the virus may contribute to delays in economic recovery particularly for the travel industry 

the measures implemented to contain the covid19 pandemic initially led to unprecedented levels of cancellations and continues to have a negative impact on the number of new travel bookings moreover we have modified our cancellation policies in light of the covid19 pandemic for example except as otherwise required by relevant law on nearterm hotel bookings with nonrefundable rates impacted by covid19 we have been providing refunds where hotels agree to make the booking refundable otherwise we have offered customers credit toward a future booking we continue to adapt our cancellation policies as the situation evolves the significant increase in refunds that we experienced in 2020 and may continue to experience has led to materially negative cash flow which has and will continue to negatively impact our cash balance and overall liquidity position until travel demand begins to recover from current levels we also may be negatively impacted by the 

loss of opportunity to crosssell or market products and services to customers who originally booked air travel with us but who will ultimately redeem air travel credits received during the covid19 pandemic directly from the airlines moreover any additional measures or changes in laws or regulations whether in the united states or other countries that further impair the ability or desire of individuals to travel including laws or regulations banning travel requiring the closure of hotels or other travelrelated businesses such as restaurants or otherwise restricting travel due to the risk of the spreading of covid19 may exacerbate the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity position we may also face inquiries and investigations from government regulators who claim that we should have refunded travelers or taken actions to otherwise provide redress to travelers who could not travel due to covid19 restrictions 

the pandemic has impeded global economic activity for an extended period and could continue to do so even as restrictions are lifted leading to a continuation of the already significant decrease in per capita income and disposable income increased and sustained unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence all of which could significantly reduce discretionary spending by individuals and businesses on travel in turn that could have a negative impact on demand for our services and could lead our partners or us to reduce prices or offer incentives to attract travelers we also cannot predict the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on our partners and their business and operations or the ways that the pandemic may fundamentally alter the travel industry in particular we may need to adjust to a travel industry with fewer and different suppliers as well as structural changes to certain types of travel for example there is uncertainty over whether and how corporate travel will rebound given the increase in remote working and use of video conference technology in addition to safety concerns related to business travelers’ health 

while we have undertaken certain actions to attempt to mitigate the effects of covid19 on our business our costsavings activities may lead to disruptions in our business inability to enhance or preserve our brand awareness reduced employee morale and productivity increased attrition and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for the reasons set forth above and other reasons that may come to light as the covid19 pandemic and containment measures evolve over time it is difficult to estimate with accuracy the impact to our future revenues results of operations cash flows liquidity or financial condition but such impacts have been and will continue to be significant and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity position for the foreseeable future 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional providers of travelrelated services including online travel agencies alternative accommodation providers wholesalers and tour operators travel product suppliers including hotels airlines and car rental companies search engines and large online portal websites travel metasearch services corporate travel management service providers mobile platform travel applications social media websites ecommerce and group buying websites and other participants in the travel industry 

online travel agencies and alternative accommodations providers in particular we face increasing competition from other otas and alternative accommodations in many regions such as booking holdings and its subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom tripcom which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth and airbnb our ota competitors are increasingly expanding the range of travel services they offer and the global ota segment continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships airbnb booking holdings and other providers of alternative accommodations provide an alternative to hotel rooms and compete with alternative accommodation properties available through expedia group brands including vrbo the continued growth of alternative accommodation providers could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and alternative accommodations furthermore airbnb and similar providers could increasingly look to add other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional otas 

travel suppliers travel suppliers such as hotels airlines and rental car companies may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them many of these competitors have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors through favorable rates and bonus or loyal points for direct booking surcharges for booking outside of the supplier’s own website suppliers combining to establish a single search platform and other tactics to drive traffic directly to supplier websites 

search engines and large online portal websites we also face increasing competition from google and other search engines there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance to the extent that google uses its market position to disintermediate online travel agencies through its own offerings or capabilities refer customers directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites offer the ability to transact on their own website or promote their own competing products by placing their own offerings at the top of organic search results 

in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas for example google has continued to add features and functionality to its travel metasearch products “google travel” “google flights” and “hotel ads” which are growing rapidly and has integrated reservation functionality into the hotel ads product in addition google may be able to leverage the data they collect on users to the detriment of us and other otas search engines also may continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our brands or brands in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivago compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch websites travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of booking holdings trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia group tripadvisor skyscanner and qunar both are subsidiaries of tripcom aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch websites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise or if ota advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago’s metasearch marketplace trivago’s business and therefore our results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express global business travel gbt as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile and other platform travel applications the demand for and functionality of smartphones tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

applications and social media websites applications and social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition 

ecommerce and group buying websites traditional consumer ecommerce platforms including amazon and alibaba and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market for example traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites to the extent our travelers use these websites these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

other participants in the travel industry other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services we offer to our travelers our travel industry affiliates and partners or our corporate clients for example ridesharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate to the extent any of these services gain market share over time it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or healthrelated events our business and financial performance are affected by the overall health of the worldwide travel industry factors that could negatively affect the travel industry in general and our business in particular potentially materially include political instability geopolitical conflicts trade disputes significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues macroeconomic concerns bans on travel to and from certain countries significant changes in oil prices continued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation reduced access to discount fares travel strikes or labor unrest bankruptcies or liquidations increased incidents of actual or threatened terrorism uncertainties and effects of brexit natural disasters travelrelated accidents or grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns changes in regulations policies or conditions related to sustainability and climate change and changes to visa and immigration requirements or border control policies our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and average daily rates “adrs” changes in airline capacity and airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

because these events or concerns and the full impact of their effects are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers and decrease demand decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity war or travelrelated health events could result in significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions and travelrelated health events provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers including owners and managers of alternative accommodation properties and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular lodging suppliers airlines and gds partners for bookings made through our channels each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous supplier contracts 

no assurances can be given that travel suppliers will elect to participate in our platform or that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services for example adrs or ticket prices attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

financial risks 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may whether due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors out of our control be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

although our cash flows from operations and available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet obligations and commitments to date we cannot predict how the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts could affect our liquidity in the future our substantial indebtedness particularly following the transactions completed in response to the impacts of covid19 the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness and market conditions may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to meet potential future liquidity needs if our liquidity is materially diminished we may not be able to timely pay debts or leases or comply with material provisions of our contractual obligations 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and other potential pandemic or healthrelated events we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers if as was the case in 2020 our merchant hotel business declined further it would likely result in further pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

our ability to raise financing depends in significant measure on characteristics of the capital and credit markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets and constraints on our liquidity we cannot guarantee that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or other actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar ratings agencies deterioration of our financial condition increase in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital including with respect to ratings downgrades the interest rate applicable to certain of our outstanding senior notes 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2020 we have outstanding longterm indebtedness excluding current maturities with a face value of 83 billion and we have revolving credit facilities with outstanding commitments totaling 20 billion which is essentially untapped risks relating to our indebtedness include 



the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 



in addition our revolving credit facilities require that we meet certain financial tests including a minimum liquidity test and starting at the end of 2021 a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness including the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds and our secured lenders may be able to foreclose against the assets constituting collateral for our secured debt in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business or otherwise the terms of our revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify in addition the interest rate payable on our 12 billion of 95 series a preferred stock could increase by 100 to 300 basis points if as a result of additional borrowings our leverage ratio under the credit agreement exceeds 5 to 1 

operational risks 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we rely heavily on internet search engines such as google through the purchase of travelrelated keywords and through organic search to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the placement or cost of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch websites including kayak tripadvisor and trivago pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or display of results which could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit participation in the search query results in particular google has in the past and may continue to in the future change its algorithms or results in a manner that has negatively affected the search engine ranking paid and unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates and those of our thirdparty distribution partners which has adversely impacted our business and financial performance google has also increasingly added its own travel search functionality and content at the expense of traditional paid listings and organic search results which may continue to reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates if google or other search or metasearch companies continue to pursue these or similar strategies which is out of our control or we do not successfully manage our paid and unpaid search strategies we could face a significant decrease in traffic to our websites andor increased costs related to replacing unpaid traffic with paid traffic 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base in exist ing and emerging markets we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase and given the economic uncertainty and unpredictability around when the travel industry will recover decisions we make on investing in brands could be less effective and costlier than expected 

in recent years certain online travel companies and metasearch websites expanded their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically resulting in less direct traffic and increased customer acquisition costs moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia group portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio in addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks 

payments regulations the processing and acceptance of a variety of payment methods is subject to various laws rules regulations legal interpretations and regulatory guidance including those governing crossborder and domestic money transmission and funds transfers foreign exchange payment services and consumer protection if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services 

moreover for existing and future payment options we offer to both our customers and suppliers we are and may increasingly be subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes such as the eea’s revised payment services directive “psd2” which began being enforced on january 1 2021 psd2 imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a payment transaction which could result in significant costs to us and our suppliers and reduce the ease of use of our payments options 

third party payment service providers we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these payment processors under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these payment processors may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of payment processing services by one or more of our payment processors could materially reduce 

our liquidity further the software and services provided by payment processors may fail to meet our expectations contain errors or vulnerabilities be compromised or experience outages any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to process payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected  

payment card networks the payment card networks such as visa mastercard and american express may increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks and may impose special fees or assessments on any such transaction our payment processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us which could increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our financial performance 

in addition the payment card networks have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept payment cards and include payment card association operating rules the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss moreover the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with or costly to implement if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments and be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are subject to paymentsrelated fraud risks 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” in addition the payment card networks have rules around acceptable charge back ratios accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones tablet computers and inhome assistants and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks and our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we have numerous significant commercial arrangements with business partners and we rely on thirdparty service providers for a broad ranges of key services including both external customerfacing services such as customer support and booking fulfillment and internal services related to our operations technology development and infrastructure if these partners or service providers fail to meet our requirements or legal or regulatory requirements it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions likewise if one of our thirdparty service providers were to cease operations face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and disruption to our own business operations until an equivalent alternative could be sourced or developed any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance additionally due to the covid19 pandemic most of our employees are working remotely which may strain the ability of certain technology vendors to support the increased demand for services such as remote connectivity 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences as well as the regulatory and tax landscapes of each country into which we expand could slow our growth or prevent our 

ability to compete effectively in certain markets for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time additionally some countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that make competition by foreign companies costly or operationally difficult in those markets 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 



acquisitions investments divestitures or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in divested or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on such transactions any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to such transactions that may have a material impact on our business are 





moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired private companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and peter kern our vice chairman and chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company expedia group cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr kern or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees for example restrictions on travel related to the covid19 pandemic may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our plans to increase our operational efficiencies and our restructuring efforts may adversely affect our business 

during 2019 we initiated a restructuring of portions of our global workforce in an effort to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and the operation of our overall businesses in february 2020 we announced our intention to pursue operating cost savings by further simplifying our organization streamlining priorities and operating more 

efficiently and due to the covid19 pandemic we implemented certain additional operational cost saving actions beyond what had been originally planned 

the operational efficiencies and restructuring actions we undertook in 2019 and 2020 as well as future actions may not achieve our targeted operational cost savings improvements and efficiencies which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements andor cost reductions these risks include among others higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans management distraction from ongoing business activities failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans damage to our reputation and brand image additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency adverse effects on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees any of these consequences could adversely impact our business 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages letters of credit and for certain of our transactions the receipt and holding of traveler payments and subsequent remittance of a portion of those payments to travel suppliers as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2020 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 31 billion additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 214 million and held term deposits of approximately 73 million as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2020 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 14 billion the fair value of which was a liability of approximately 14 million we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these term deposits or forward contracts our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets held may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding and the receipt and remittance of payments via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease i n addition we face significant credit risk and potential payment delays with respect to nonfinancial contract counterparties including our expedia business services and vrbo partners which may be exacerbated by economic downturns the realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies that revalue our cash flows monetary assets and liabilities and translate our foreign subsidiary financial results to us dollars in particular we face exposure related to fluctuations in accommodation revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay as well as the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

legal and regulatory risks 

our alternative accommodations business is subject to regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

our alternative accommodations business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments that affect the alternative accommodation industry and the ability of companies like us to list those alternative accommodations online for example certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit or limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or that regulate short term rental platforms’ ability to list alternative accommodations including prohibiting the listing of unlicensed properties other domestic and foreign jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm rentals in addition many of the laws that 

impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and the alternative accommodation industry which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our alternative accommodations business and results of operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia group’s operations and financial results 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and alternative accommodation licensing and listing requirements the provision of travel packages the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection licensing and regulations relating to the offer of travel insurance and related products anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security the provision of payment services and privacy for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services additionally some jurisdictions have implemented or are considering implementing regulations that restrict or could restrict access to city centers and p opular destinations as well as impact our ability to offer accommodations such as by limiting the construction of new hotels or renting of alternative accommodations also compliance with the european economic community “eec” council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours could be costly and complex and could adversely impact our ability to offer certain packages in the eec 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations antimoney laundering and anticorruption laws across industries as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities for example on may 17 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with ofac regarding 2221 potentially noncompliant cubarelated travel transactions that occurred between 20112014 which we voluntarily disclosed to ofac in 2014 in connection with the settlement agreement we made significant enhancements to our economic sanctions compliance program and associated controls ofac agreed to release us without any finding of fault from all civil liability in connection with the potential violations in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries or legal proceedings from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with economic sanctions consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia group and the presentation of information to consumers as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  competition and consumer matters the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities given a focus on revenue generation taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their enforcement of such laws rules and regulations resulting in increased audit activity and audit assessments and legislation including new taxes on our technology platform and digital services as such potential tax liabilities may exceed our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices and incur additional cost to comply any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits andor levied assessments asserting we are required to collect andor remit state and local sales or use taxes value added taxes or other transactional taxes related to our travel facilitation services including the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

in the past been we have been required and in the future may be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay substantial tax assessments prior to contesting their validity a description of recent significant “paytoplay” payments and refunds as well as ongoing tax inquiries or audits in other “paytoplay” jurisdictions is included in note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation taxing authorities may disagree with our crossjurisdictional transfer pricing including the amount or support for such charges we believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits may be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities potentially including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of domestic or international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

many of the statutory laws rules and regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were enacted before the growth of the digital economy certain jurisdictions have enacted new tax laws rules and regulations directed at taxing the digital economy and multinational businesses if existing tax laws rules or regulations change by amendment or new legislation with respect to occupancy tax sales tax valueadded taxes goods and services tax digital services tax withholding taxes revenue based taxes unclaimed property or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy or multinational businesses the result of these changes could increase our tax liabilities potential outcomes include prospectively or retrospectively additional responsibility to collect and remit indirect taxes including on behalf of travel suppliers imposition of interest and penalties multiple levels of taxation and an obligation to comply with information reporting laws or regulations requiring us to provide information about travel suppliers customers and transactions on our technology platform the outcome of these changes may have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance demand for our products and services may decrease if we pass on such costs to the consumer tax reporting and compliance obligations may result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decide not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions 

taxing authorities have focused legislative efforts on tax reform transparency and base erosion prevention as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in various jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in several jurisdictions in general changes in tax laws may affect our effective tax rate increase our tax liabilities and impact the value of deferred tax balances 

since releasing its interim report in 2018 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has proposed measures to address corporate tax challenges of the digital economy these measures include “pillar one and pillar two” reports that focus on nexus profit allocation and minimum tax proposals as the oecd continues its evaluation of these proposals several territories have enacted or proposed measures to impose new digital services taxes on companies these taxes are incremental to taxes historically incurred by the company and result in taxation of the same revenue in multiple countries the enacted and proposed measures may have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

our tax liabilities in the future may also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of revenue and earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax balances or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with relevant governmental authorities and legislators as appropriate to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws rules and regulations however due to the increasing pace of legislative changes and the scale of our business activities any substantial changes in tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the taxes we are required to pay our financial position and results of operations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and disputes involving taxes personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions has been and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and the outcomes of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from all forms of copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites and mobile applications rely on content brands trademarks domain names and technology much of which is proprietary we establish and protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark domain name copyright trade secret and patent laws in the us and other jurisdictions license and confidentiality agreements and internal policies and procedures in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information and intellectual property even with these precautions however third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or confusingly similar trademarks or domain names without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark domain name copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems in many areas of our business including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity marketing communications procurement payments tax collection and remittance fraud detection and administration which we must continuously improve and upgrade 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings cloud computing the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes including new devices services and home assistants and developing technologies have and will continue to require new and costly investments transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers for example we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services 

we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms such as cloud computing services to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site features 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including through spyware viruses phishing denial of service and similar attacks by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent in addition as we continue to migrate legacy systems to new or existing information technology systems we increase the risk of system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon  including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers  and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our customers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause 

losses we also face risks related to our ability to maintain data and hardware security with respect to remote working during the covid19 pandemic 

in addition no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time 

we process store and use customer supplier and employee personal financial and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use theft or destruction 

there are numerous laws regarding the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal financial and other data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of our businesses 

any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with privacyrelated legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use theft or destruction of such data may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans in addition such an event could result in violations of applicable us and international laws governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation 

we are subject to privacy regulations and compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny some us states including california have passed comprehensive privacy legislation or are considering privacy legislation in addition the general data protection regulation or gdpr that went into effect in the european union in may 2018 requires companies to implement and remain compliant with regulations regarding the handling of personal data at least 12 additional countries in asia eastern europe and latin america have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to comply with the gdpr and other privacy laws and regulations failure to meet any of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or legal liability adverse publicity andor damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

governance risks 

mr diller may be deemed to beneficially own shares representing approximately 29 of the outstanding voting power of expedia group 

as of december 31 2020 mr diller may be deemed to have beneficially owned 100 of expedia group’s outstanding class b common stock representing approximately 29 of the total voting power of all shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock outstanding in the future mr diller’s ownership percentage in expedia group could increase if he buys additional shares of expedia group common stock in open market purchases or otherwise or if expedia group repurchases shares of its common stock while it is possible that mr diller may at some point in the future beneficially own more than 50 of the outstanding voting power of expedia group the provisions of the governance agreement and expedia group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that subject to limited exception no current or future holder of original shares may participate in or vote in favor of or tender shares into any change of control transaction involving at least 50 of the outstanding shares or voting power of capital stock of expedia group unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration or election right and the same participation rights for shares of expedia group class b common stock and shares of expedia group common stock additionally the governance agreement does not provide mr diller with any consent rights over corporate actions or matters 

mr diller is also currently the chairman of expedia group’s board of directors and senior executive of expedia group expedia group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the chairman of the board may only be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of at least 80 of the entire board of directors which provision may not be amended altered changed or repealed or any provision inconsistent therewith adopted without the approval of at least 1 80 

of the entire board of directors and 2 80 of the voting power of expedia group’s outstanding voting securities voting together as a single class 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power mr diller is in a position to influence and potentially control significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets additionally in the future another holder of the original shares might have such a position of influence by virtue of ownership interests in the original shares this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to expedia group stockholders 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia group management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iacinteractivecorp or iac each of ms clinton and mr von furstenberg also serves as a member of the board of directors of both expedia group and iac these overlapping relationships could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for the directors or officers when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia group mr diller in particular may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between the companies 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia group who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia group because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group 

risks related to ownership of our stock 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other risks the risks described in this item 1a as well as

in the ordinary course of business expedia group and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings and claims involving property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights and other claims the amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage 

rules of the sec require the description of material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incident to the registrant’s business and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts exclusive of interest and costs not individually exceeding 10 of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in the judgment of management none of the pending litigation matters that the company and its subsidiaries are defending including those described below involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude the litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or results of operations based upon the standard set forth in the sec’s rules

competition and consumer matters 

over the last several years the online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities “ncas” particularly in europe 

matters relating to contractual provisions with accommodations providers 

expedia group companies are or have been involved in a number of investigations by european ncas predominately related to whether certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia group entities and accommodation providers sometimes also referred to as “most favored nation” or “mfn” provisions are anticompetitive 

with effect from august 1 2015 expedia group companies waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with european hotel partners while the expedia group companies maintain that their parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law these waivers were nevertheless implemented as a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis following the implementation of the expedia group companies waivers nearly all ncas in europe announced either the closure of their investigation or inquiries involving expedia group companies or a decision not to open an investigation or inquiry involving expedia group companies however certain related matters remain ongoing including 

• the german federal cartel office against the expedia group companies’ contractual parity provisions with accommodation providers in germany remains open but is still at a preliminary stage with no formal allegations of wrongdoing having been communicated to the expedia group companies to date 

• the italian competition authoritys case closure decision against bookingcom and expedia group companies was subsequently been appealed by two italian hotel trade associations ie federalberghi and aica the aica appeal was cancelled for lack of interest of the aica on december 12 2019 the federalberghi appeal remains at an early stage and no hearing date has been fixed 

• a working group of 10 european ncas belgium czech republic denmark france hungary ireland italy netherlands sweden and the united kingdom and the european commission was established by the european competition network “ecn” at the end of 2015 to monitor the functioning of the online hotel booking sector following amendments made by a number of online travel companies including bookingcom and expedia group companies in relation to certain parity provisions in their contracts with hotels this working group has stated its intention to keep the sector under review and reassess the competitive situation in due course 

• legislative bodies in france july 2015 austria december 2016 italy august 2017 and belgium august 2018 have also adopted domestic antiparity clause legislation expedia group believes each of these pieces of legislation violates both eu and national legal principles and therefore expedia group companies have challenged these laws at the european commission in addition a motion requesting the swiss government to take action on narrow price parity has been adopted in the swiss parliament the swiss government is now in the process of drafting legislation implementing the motion 

a number of ncas outside of europe have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including expedia group companies in certain of these jurisdictions including australia brazil hong kong and new zealand the concerns were resolved with expedia group companies’ waiver of certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with hotel partners in the respective jurisdictions 

in other cases expedia group companies are in ongoing discussions with ncas for example in april 2019 the japan fair trade commission “jftc” launched an investigation into certain practices of a number of online travel companies including expedia group companies and in february 2020 the korean fair trade commission “kftc” issued a request for information relating to hotel contracts entered into by expedia group companies expedia group is cooperating with both authorities 

matters relating to online marketplaces 

regulatory authorities in europe including the uk competition and markets authority or “cma” australia and elsewhere have initiated legal proceedings andor undertaken market studies inquiries or investigations relating to online 

marketplaces and how information is presented to consumers using those marketplaces including practices such as search results rankings and algorithms discount claims  disclosure of charges and availability and similar messaging 

in june 2018 the cma announced that it will be requiring hotel booking websites to take action to address concerns identified in the course of its ongoing investigation after consulting with the cma we agreed to offer certain voluntary undertakings with respect to the presentation of information on certain of our uk consumerfacing websites in order to address the cma’s concerns which became effective in september 2019 and the cma subsequently confirmed that as a result of the undertakings offered it has closed its investigation without any admission or finding of liability following additional inquiries from other ncas in the european union expedia group companies subsequently made similar commitments with the consumer protection cooperation network that became applicable in the european union in october 2020 

on august 23 2018 the australian competition and consumer commission or accc instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law or acl relating to trivago’s advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s australian site trivago’s strikethrough pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivagos australian website see note 15 — commitments and contingencies for additional information on this matter 

we are cooperating with regulators in the investigations described above where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect such actions will have on our business industry practices or online commerce more generally

trends 

the covid19 pandemic and measures to contain the virus including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders have had a significant negative impact on the travel industry covid19 has negatively impacted consumer sentiment and consumer’s ability to travel and many of our supply partners particularly airlines and hotels continue to operate at reduced service levels 

as the spread of the virus has been contained to varying degrees in certain countries some travel restrictions have been lifted and consumers have become more comfortable traveling particularly to domestic locations this has led to a moderation of the declines in travel bookings and in cancellation rates compared to the march and april 2020 time period however travel booking volume remains significantly below prior year levels and cancellation levels remain elevated compared to precovid levels 

the degree of containment of the virus and the recovery in travel has varied country by country during the recovery period there have been instances where cases of covid19 have started to increase again after a period of decline which in some cases impacted the recovery of travel in certain countries while many countries have begun the process of vaccinating their residents against covid19 the large scale and challenging logistics of distributing t he vaccines as well as uncertainty over the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants of the virus may contribute to delays in economic recovery covid19 has also had broader economic impacts including an increase in unemployment levels and reduction in economic activity which could lead to recession and further reduction in consumer or business spending on travel activities which may negatively impact the timing and level of a recovery in travel demand broader sustained negative economic impacts could also put strain on our suppliers business and service partners which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions 

our financial and operating results for 2020 were significantly impacted due to the decrease in travel demand related to covid19 we expect the impact to the overall travel market and our business to continue into 2021 the full duration and total impact of covid19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and in particular our business 

additionally further healthrelated events political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and natural disasters are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

prior to the onset of covid19 we began to execute a cost savings initiative aimed at simplifying the organization and increasing efficiency following the onset of covid19 we accelerated execution on several of these cost savings initiatives and took additional actions to reduce costs to help mitigate the impact to demand from covid19 and reduce our monthly cash usage while some cost actions during covid19 are temporary and intended to minimize cash usage during this disruption we expect to continue to benefit from the majority of the savings when business conditions return to more normalized levels overall we now expect annualized runrate fixed cost savings of 700 to 750 million and we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to increase efficiency and improve operational effectiveness across the company in addition to the actions to reduce fixed costs we are executing initiatives to reduce certain variable costs and improve our marketing efficiency 

as a result of these cost savings initiatives we expect adjusted ebitda margins to increase compared to historical levels when revenue returns to more normalized levels

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet are driving rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2019 approximately 45 of us and european leisure and unmanaged corporate travel expenditures occurred online this figure was estimated to reach approximately 50 in 2020 prior to the outbreak of covid19 online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of the united states and europe these penetration rates increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business while also attracting many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google evidenced by continued product enhancements including new trip planning features for users and the integration of its various travel products into the google travel offering as well as further prioritizing its own products in search results competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom owned by booking holdings trivago in which expedia group owns a majority interest as well as tripadvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools further airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services in addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry businesses such as airbnb vrbo previously homeaway which expedia group acquired in december 2015 and bookingcom owned by booking holdings have emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market many other competitors including vacation rental metasearch players continue to emerge in this space which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their websites 

the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia group facilitates both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agencyonly contracts as well as our hybrid etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

we have recently shifted to managing our marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio in our retail segment to optimize results for the company and making decisions on a market by market and customer segment basis that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment over time intense competition historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins during 2020 we have increased our focus on opportunities to differentiate brands across customer and geographic segments increase marketing efficiency drive a higher proportion of transactions through direct channels and ultimately improve the balance of transaction growth and profitability for more detail see part i item 1a risk factors  we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing” and “our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally” 

lodging 

lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2020 lodging accounted for 78 as a result of the impact on travel demand from the covid19 outbreak room nights declined 55 in 2020 as compared to growth of 11 in 2019 and 13 in 2018 the timing of recovery in consumer sentiment on travel and on staying at hotels will be a factor in our level of room night growth and as noted above we expect that to vary by country average daily rates “adrs” for rooms booked on expedia group websites increased 5 in 2018 decreased 1 in 2019 and increased 3 in 2020 during 2020 the yearoveryear increase in adrs for our vrbo business remained elevated compared to years prior to the covid19 outbreak and vrbo which carries a higher adr than hotels accounted for a higher percentage of room nights due to the faster recovery in alternative accommodations during this period this was partially offset by declines in hotel adrs 

the uncertain environment related to covid19 and the potential for a higher degree of discounting activity due to the lower travel demand could result in continued hotel adr declines for a period of time similarly fluctuations in supply and 

demand for alternative accommodations could impact adrs for vrbo in addition travel restrictions and shift in consumer behavior during covid19 that impact the mix of our lodging bookings across geographies and types of accommodations could impact total adrs given these dynamics it is difficult to predict adr trends in the nearterm 

as of december 31 2020 our global lodging marketplace had over 29 million lodging properties available including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings and approximately 880000 hotels 

hotel we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings after rolling out etp globally over a period of several years during which time we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs our relationships and overall economics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment however with certain travel restrictions and quarantine orders implemented due to covid19 current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states are at significantly reduced levels and adrs could decline for a period of time in addition other factors could pressure adr trends including the continued growth in hotel supply in recent years and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory further while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups in the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on thirdparty websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi 

alternative accommodations with our acquisition of vrbo previously homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group vrbo has transitioned from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology vrbo offers hosts subscriptionbased listing or payperbooking service models it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings in addition we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global retail services as well as directly add alternative accommodation listings to our offerings to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers 

air 

the airline industry has been dramatically impacted by covid19 as a result of the significantly reduced air travel demand due to government travel restrictions and the impact on consumer sentiment related to covid19 airlines have been operating with less capacity and passenger traffic has declined significantly during the third and fourth quarter of 2020 air passenger traffic declines further moderated and remained stable but continue to lag the recover in lodging bookings the recovery in air travel remains difficult to predict and may not correlate with the recovery in lodging demand according to the transportation security administration “tsa” air traveler 7day average throughput declined 95 in april 2020 compared to prior year levels the declines moderated to down 73 in midjuly 2020 and have largely stabilized in the 60 to 65 range since midoctober in addition as of late november the international air transport association “iata” expected airline passenger traffic to increase approximately 55 in 2021 compared to 2020 levels representing a decline of nearly 40 compared to 2019 levels 

in addition there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue given current volatility it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine certain supply agreements renew and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets 

air ticket volumes increased 5 in 2018 and 7 in 2019 and declined 63 in 2020 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2020 air accounted for 2 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch website and expedia group media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2020 we generated  405 million of advertising and media revenue a 63 decline from 2019 representing 8 of our total worldwide revenue given the decline in travel demand related to covid19 online travel agencies have 

dramatically reduced marketing spend including on trivago and given the uncertain duration and impact of covid19 it is difficult to predict when spend will recover to normalized levels in response trivago has significantly reduced its marketing spend and taken additional actions to lower operating expenses we expect trivago to continue to experience significant pressure on revenue and profit until online travel agencies and other hotel suppliers begin to see consumer demand that warrants an increase in marketing spend 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel services including merchant and agency hotel is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business historically vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago have typically been experienced in the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring summer and winter holiday travel as a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the growth of our international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix including the growth of vrbo may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

due to covid19 which led to significant cancellations for future travel during the first half of 2020 and has impacted new travel bookings for the majority of 2020 we have not experienced our typical seasonal pattern for bookings revenue and profit during the past year in addition with the lower new bookings and elevated cancellations in the merchant business model our typical seasonal working capital source of cash has been significantly disrupted resulting in the company experiencing unfavorable working capital trends and material negative cash flow during the first half of 2020 when we typically generate significant positive cash flow seasonal trends were more normalized during the second half of the year but it is difficult to forecast the seasonality for the upcoming quarters given the uncertainty related to the duration of the impact from covid19 and the shape and timing of any sustained recovery in addition we continue to experience shorter booking windows in our lodging businesses which could also impact the seasonality of our working capital and cash flow 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

deferred loyalty rewards 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom rewards program our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on over 40 brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points net of expected breakage as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors including fluctuations in reward value product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred during 2020 as a result of the significant turmoil related to covid19 we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform multiple interim impairment assessments in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and if applicable record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units except for trivago which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivagos stock price a level 1 input adjusted for an estimated control premium 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

for additional information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2020 see note 3 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense 

we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimatesall deferred income taxes are classified as longterm on our consolidated balance sheets 

we account for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority including resolution of any appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of the position if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy and other taxes  some states and localities impose taxes eg transient occupancy accommodation tax sales tax andor business privilege tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we 

calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in most jurisdictions we do not collect or remit taxes nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against vrbo for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on vrbo’s services vrbo is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 10000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in nine lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes andor ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

for additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 58 million as of december 31 2020 and 48 million as of december 31 2019 

certain jurisdictions including without limitation the states of new york new jersey north carolina minnesota oregon rhode island maryland pennsylvania hawaii iowa massachusetts arizona wisconsin idaho arkansas indiana maine nebraska vermont the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel andor other accommodations andor car rental in addition in certain jurisdictions we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state andor local taxing jurisdictions we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including without limitation the states of new york new jersey south carolina north carolina minnesota georgia wyoming west virginia oregon rhode island montana maryland kentucky maine pennsylvania hawaii iowa massachusetts arizona wisconsin idaho arkansas indiana nebraska vermont the city of new york and the district of columbia as well as certain other jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity for additional information see note 15 — commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings  paytoplay in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other jurisdictions we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities some of which including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes may impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

segments 

beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we have the following reportable segments retail b2b and trivago our retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world vrbo orbitz travelocity wotif group ebookers cheaptickets hotwirecom carrentalscom cruiseshipcenter and classic vacations our b2b segment is comprised of our expedia business services organization including expedia partner solutions which offers private label and cobranded products to make travel services available to travelers through thirdparty company branded websites and egencia a fullservice travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are reduced for cancellations and refunds revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 



 

1 trivago which is comprised of a hotel metasearch business that differs from our transactionbased websites does not have associated gross bookings or revenue margin however thirdparty revenue from trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin 

the decrease in worldwide gross bookings in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the covid19 pandemic and the associated reduction in travel demand with declines across lodging air and other travel products in the current year 

revenue margin in 2020 was higher than 2019 due in part to the significant lodging cancellations which reduced gross bookings creating an unusual mix of bookings and revenue in the year current period revenue margins are not indicative of our future expectations 

results of operations 

revenue 



similar to the gross bookings decline revenue decreased 57 in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by the covid19 pandemic across all segments and lodging air and other travel products 



 

1 includes thirdparty revenue from trivago as well as our transactionbased websites 

lodging revenue decreased 52 in 2020 on a 55 decrease in room nights stayed partially offset by a 9 increase in revenue per room night revenue per room night in 2020 benefited from an increase in the percentage of room nights contributed by vrbo which has a higher revenue per room night than the rest of our lodging business and transaction revenue related to vrbos transition to merchant of record 

air revenue decreased 88 in 2020 reflecting a 63 decline in tickets sold and a 67 decrease in revenue per ticket the decline in revenue per ticket was primarily related to a shift in product mix 

advertising and media revenue decreased 63 in 2020 due to declines at trivago and expedia group media solutions 

all other revenue which includes car rental insurance destination services fees related to our corporate travel business and revenue related to bodybuildingcom during the period of our ownership of july 2019 to may 2020 decreased by 63 in 2020 resulting from declines in insurance driven by the adverse impact of contrarevenue related to customer claims created during covid19 with thirdparty insurance as well as declines in car and corporate travel business revenue 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 



the decrease in merchant revenue in 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in merchant hotel revenue driven by a decrease in room nights stayed and lower insurance revenue partially offset by an increase in vrbo merchant alternative accommodations revenue driven by vrbos transition to merchant of record 

the decrease in agency revenue in 2020 was primarily due to the decline in agency hotel and air as well as vrbo agency alternative accommodations revenue 

advertising media and other decreased 53 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in advertising revenue 

cost of revenue 



cost of revenue primarily consists of direct costs to support our customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors credit card processing including merchant fees fraud and chargebacks and other costs primarily including data center and cloud costs to support our websites supplier operations destination supply certain transactional level taxes costs related to bodybuildingcom during our period of ownership as well as related personnel and overhead costs including stockbased compensation 

cost of revenue decreased 397 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decline in merchant fees resulting from lower transaction volumes a decline in customer service and personnel costs and lower cloud expenses partially offset by higher payment processing costs related to vrbo’s transition to merchant of record and higher bad debt reserves related to future collection risk from the impact of covid19 

selling and marketing 



selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our various brands and global supply organization as well as stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses decreased 35 billion during 2020 compared to 2019 driven by a decrease in direct costs driven by a significant reduction in marketing spend starting in march 2020 and continuing throughout 2020 related to the impact on travel demand from covid19 the decrease in indirect costs was due to lower personnel and related costs including lower incentive compensation costs resulting from the shift away from cash bonuses in 2020 to equity that will vest in 2021 

technology and content 



technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead including stockbased compensation as well as other costs including cloud expense and licensing and maintenance expense 

technology and content expense decreased 216 million for 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflecting lower personnel and related costs including lower incentive compensation costs 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions and related stockbased compensation as well as fees for external professional services 

general and administrative expense decreased 218 million in 2020 compared to 2019 mainly driven by lower personnel costs including lower incentive compensation costs lower professional fees and lower stockbased compensation of 34 million in part due to the fourth quarter of 2019 acceleration of expense related to the departure of our former ceo 

depreciation and amortization 



depreciation increased 27 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to depreciation related to our new headquarters and higher internaluse software and website development depreciation partially offset by lower data center depreciation amortization of intangible assets decreased 44 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets as well as the impact of definitelived intangible impairments in the current year 

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

during 2020 as a result of the significant negative impact related to the covid19 which has had a severe effect on the entire global travel industry we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 799 million as well as intangible asset impairment charges of 175 million see note 3 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 



legal reserves occupancy tax and other primarily consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2020 we recorded a 25 million gain in relation to a legal settlement which was partially offset by changes in our reserves related to occupancy and other matters 

during 2019 we received a 10 million refund of prepaid paytoplay amounts from the state of hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation resulting in a corresponding benefit during the period which nets down increases in reserves for occupancy tax and other matters 

for additional information see note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and related reorganization charges 

in late february 2020 we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies which have resulted in headcount reductions and subsequently in 2020 the company accelerated further actions to adapt our business to the current environment as a result we recognized 231 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2020 based on current plans which are subject to change we expect total reorganization charges in 2021 of approximately 60 million however we continue to actively evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we will incur additional reorganization charges 

we also engaged in certain smaller scale restructure actions in 2019 to centralize and migrate certain operational functions and systems for which we recognized 24 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2019 which were primarily related to severance benefits and professional fees 

operating income loss 



in 2020 we had operating loss of 27 billion compared to operating income of 903 million in 2019 primarily due to significant declining revenue in 2020 resulting from the covid19 pandemic as well as the goodwill and intangible impairments and restructure charges mentioned above 

adjusted ebitda by segment 



 

1 includes immaterial operating results of bodybuildingcom subsequent to our acquisition in july 2019 through its sale in may 2020 

2 adjusted ebitda is a nongaap measure see definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda below for more information 

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric see note 19 — segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income loss attributable to expedia group inc for the periods presented above 

our retail b2b and trivago segment adjusted ebitda significantly declined during 2020 compared to 2019 resulting from impacts of the covid19 pandemic which drove meaningful revenue declines partially offset by a decline in direct sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue unallocated overhead costs decreased 119 million during 2020 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses 

retail adjusted ebitda increased 33 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses including an increase in direct sales and marketing expense 

b2b adjusted ebitda increased 106 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in revenue as well as leverage on operating expenses 

trivago adjusted ebitda increased 69 million during 2019 compared to 2018 beginning late in the second quarter of 2018 trivago started focusing on improved profitability and made significant reductions in its advertising spend as a result of this increased focus on reducing operating expenditures the negative marketing spend adversely impacted revenue growth while benefiting profitability this trend continued in 2019 

unallocated overhead costs increased 44 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as well as technology expenses 

interest income and expense 



interest income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of lower rates of return 

interest expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of additional interest on the 125 billion senior unsecured notes issued in september 2019 the 275 billion senior unsecured notes issued in may 2020 the 125 billion senior unsecured notes issued in july 2020 as well as interest expense on our outstanding revolving credit facility amounts during 2020 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 



during 2020 losses on minority equity investments net included 134 million of impairment losses related to a minority investment as well as 6 million of marktomarket losses related to our publicly traded marketable equity investment despegar see note 3 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

provision for income taxes 



our effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the 21 federal statutory income tax rate due to valuation allowances and nondeductible impairments measured against a pretax loss our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21 federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes foreign income taxed at higher than the federal statutory tax rate as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we do not record a tax benefit 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal state and foreign tax authorities during the fourth quarter of 2019 the internal revenue service “irs” issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years the proposed adjustments would increase our us taxable income by 696 million which would result in federal tax of approximately 244 million subject to interest we do not agree with the position of the irs we filed a protest with the irs for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and appeals returned our case to exam for further review we are also under examination by the irs for our 2014 to 2016 tax years subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years 

for additional information see note 10 — income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters which may ultimately be settled in cash and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above in the legal proceedings section as well as the notes to the financial statements the nongaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to expedia group inc adjusted for 1 net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 provision for income taxes 3 total other expenses net 4 stockbased compensation expense including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans 5 acquisitionrelated impacts including i amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment ii gains losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements if any and iii upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree if any 6 certain other items including restructuring 7 items included in legal reserves occupancy tax and other 8 that portion of gains losses on revenue hedging activities that are included in other net that relate to revenue recognized in the period and 9 depreciation 

the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future ongoing performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments in addition we believe that by excluding certain items such as stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated impacts adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 

the reconciliation of net income loss attributable to expedia group inc to adjusted ebitda is as follows 



financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations cash available under our revolving credit facilities as well as our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 34 billion and 38 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 

as of december 31 2020 the total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 958 million 677 million in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries and 281 million in majorityowned subsidiaries the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the unites states and for which future distributions could be taxable was 85 million as of december 31 2020 the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the us federal income tax consequences of these earnings was 22 million as of december 31 2020 

managing our balance sheet prudently and maintaining appropriate liquidity are high priorities during the current covid19 pandemic in order to best position the company to navigate our current working capital challenges and depressed revenue throughout 2020 we have taken a number of actions to bolster our liquidity and preserve financial flexibility including 

• suspension of share repurchases we have not repurchased any shares since our earnings call on february 13 2020 and have suspended future share repurchases 

• suspension of quarterly dividends we do not expect to declare quarterly dividends on our common stock at least until the current economic and operating environment improves 

• private equity investment on april 23 2020 we entered into an investment agreement with ap fort holdings lp an affiliate of apollo global management inc and an investment agreement with slp fort aggregator ii lp and slp v fort holdings ii lp affiliates of silver lake group llc to raise approximately 12 billion in gross proceeds in a private placement of shares of a newly created series of preferred stock and warrants to purchase our common stock the transaction was completed on may 5 2020 

• senior notes issuances on may 5 2020 we privately placed 2 billion of unsecured 6250 senior notes that are due in may 2025 the “625 notes” and 750 million of unsecured 7000 senior notes due may 2025 the “70 notes” and together with the 625 notes the “625 and 70 notes” the 70 notes have certain redemption provisions starting with the second anniversary of the issuance the 625 and 70  notes were issued at a price of 100 of the aggregate principal amount interest is payable semiannually in arrears in may and november of each year beginning november 1 2020 we have used and will continue to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes which included but was not limited to the repayment or redemption of our 595 senior notes in august 2020 

on july 14 2020 we privately placed 500 million of unsecured 3600 senior notes due december 2023 the “36 notes” and 750 million of unsecured 4625 senior notes due august 2027 the “4625 notes” and together with the 36 notes the “36 and 4625 notes” the 36 notes were issued at a price of 99922 of the aggregate principal amount interest is payable on the 36 notes semiannually in arrears in june and december of each year beginning december 15 2020 the 4625 notes were issued at a price of 99997 of the aggregate principal amount interest is payable on the 4625 notes semiannually in arrears in february and august of each year beginning february 1 2021 we expect to use the net proceeds to redeem outstanding shares of our 95 series a preferred stock after may 5 2021 when the redemption premium is scheduled to decrease depending on business liquidity and other trends or conditions however we may elect to use all or part of the proceeds for other general corporate purposes which may include repaying prepaying redeeming or repurchasing other indebtedness in lieu of or pending such redemption 

• revolving credit facility updates during march 2020 we increased our cash on hand by borrowing 19 billion under our then existing 2 billion revolving credit facility this existing revolving credit facility was subsequently amended in may 2020 in connection with the issuance of the 625 and 70 notes and private placement transaction to among other things provide additional flexibility under pliable covenant provisions with the amended facility initially totaling 2 billion and mature on may 31 2023 “amended credit facility” 

pursuant to the terms of amended credit facility in early august 2020 we entered into a foreign credit facility with a group of lenders “foreign credit facility” with aggregate commitments which total 855 million and maturing on may 31 2023 substantially concurrently with the establishment of the foreign credit facility the company reduced commitments under the amended credit facility in an amount equal to 855 million and prepaid indebtedness under the amended credit facility in an amount equal to 772 million which was then outstanding under the foreign credit facility 

in august 2020 we repaid the outstanding amount of 772 million on the foreign credit facility as well as 478 million under the amended credit facility in december 2020 we repaid the remaining amount outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2020 moody’s rating was baa3 with an outlook of “negative” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “negative” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “negative” april 2020 rating agency downgrades were in connection with the severe disruption to global travel caused by the covid19 pandemic changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited access to capital markets and interest rates on the 625 and 70 notes issued in may 2020 as well as on the 36 and 4625 issued in july 2020 will increase which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in note 7 — debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant lodging business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us typically the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows generally during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative with the impacts of the covid19 pandemic including the high degree of cancellations and customer refunds particularly during the first half of the year and the lower new bookings in the merchant business model these seasonal influences and the working capital source of cash to us has been significantly disrupted resulting in the company experiencing unfavorable working capital trends and material negative cash flow in the first half of 2020 with the negative cash flow moderating as booking trends improved and cancellations stabilized during the second half of 2020 the full duration and total impact of covid19 and how the recovery will unfold remains difficult to predict we expect cash flow to remain negative until the decline in new merchant bookings improves further with cancellations either remaining stable or moderating further in addition we are experiencing much shorter booking windows in our lodging businesses which could also impact the seasonality of our working capital and cash flow 

prior to covid19 we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency in response to covid19 expedia group has taken several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from covid19 and continue to improve our longterm cost structure in addition certain capital expenditures were deferred including temporarily halting construction on several real estate projects after temporarily halting 

construction on our new headquarters during the initial quarantine order we restarted construction we expect to spend approximately 900 million in total for the project of the total approximately 850 million was spent between 2016 and 2020 due to the delays related to covid19 we now expect the project to be complete in the first half of 2021 

our cash flows are as follows 



in 2020 net cash used in operating activities was 38 billion compared to cash provided by operating activities of 28 billion for 2019 impacts from the covid19 pandemic have resulted in a significant use of cash to fund working capital changes and operating losses in 2020 compared to a 2019 cash benefit from working capital the largest driver of the swing in working capital relates to a significant use of cash for deferred merchant bookings as refunds for cancelled bookings exceeded new bookings compared to an increase from deferred merchant bookings in the prior year period 

in 2020 13 billion less cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net sales of investments of 476 million in 2020 compared to net purchases of investments of 494 million in 2019 as well as lower current year capital expenditures including lower spend on our corporate headquarters 

cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included 39 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes issued in may and july 2020 11 billion of net proceeds from our private equity issuance as well as 319 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans these sources of cash were partially offset by the august 2020 repayment of 750 million of 595 notes cash paid to acquire shares of 425 million including the repurchased shares in the first quarter of 2020 and treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and cash dividend payments of 123 million cash provided by financing activities in 2019 primarily included 12 billion of net proceeds for the issuance of the 325 notes in september 2019 as well as 301 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans partially offset by 400 million payment of debt assumed in the liberty expedia transaction cash dividend payments of 195 million and cash paid to acquire shares of 743 million including the repurchased shares under the authorization discussed below as well as 24 million for repurchases with respect to the liberty expedia holdings transaction 

during 2019 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock in each of the respective years during 2018 authorized a repurchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 105 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 



   

1 amount excludes transaction costs 

as of december 31 2020 there were approximately 233 million shares remaining under the 2018 and 2019 repurchase authorizations there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases 

our common stock dividend was 034 per share for the first quarter of 2020 132 per share for 2019 and 124 per share for 2018 see note 11 — capital stock in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition during 2020 we paid 75 million or 6247 per share of series a preferred stock of dividends on the series a preferred stock the company does not expect to make future quarterly dividend payments on our common stock at least until the current economic and operating environment improves future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

foreign exchange rate changes resulted in increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2020 of 61 million reflecting a net appreciation in foreign currencies related to the us dollar during the year foreign exchange rate changes resulted in an immaterial increase of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2019 of 3 million 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facilities derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 in september 2017 we issued 1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 38 in september 2019 we issued 125 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 325 in may 2020 we privately placed 2 billion of senior unsecured notes due may 2025 that bear interest at 625 and 750 million of senior unsecured notes due may 2025 that bear interest at 70 in july 2020 we privately placed 500 million of senior unsecured notes due december 2023 that bear interest at 36 and 750 million of senior unsecured notes due august 2027 that bear interest at 4625 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates additionally the senior unsecured notes issued in may and july 2020 are subject to interest rate adjustments should our credit ratings be adjusted downwards which would result in increased interest expense in the future the total estimated fair value of our notes was approximately 91 billion and 51 billion as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized according as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes by approximately 191 million 

we maintain revolving credit facilities of 2 billion which bear interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings andor certain financial metrics because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities while we had borrowings outstanding during 2020 as of december 31 2020 consistent with december 31 2019 we had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china the united kingdom and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had a net forward liability of 14 million and 8 million respectively included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 5 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2020 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 71 million 2 million gain excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 34 million 34 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 3 million 38 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 more recently we have invested 

in migrating parts of our technology platform to the cloud as well as focused on expanding our lodging supply particularly in key international markets our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia group’s worldwide traveler base makes our websites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience to drive improvements in conversion 

product innovation each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space for more than two decades we have made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that make it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace improvements in our global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia continue to enable us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands since 2014 we have acquired travelocity wotif group and orbitz worldwide including orbitz cheaptickets and ebookers and migrated their brands to the brand expedia technology platform in addition orbitz for business customers were migrated to the egencia technology platform in 2016 we intend to continue leveraging these technology investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

channel expansion technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress innovating on its mobile websites and mobile applications contributing to solid download trends and many of our brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional pcs and an increasing percentage of transactions are coming through mobile mobile bookings continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed with a much shorter booking window than we historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods additionally our brands are implementing new technologies like voicebased search chatbots and messaging apps as mobilebased options for travelers in addition we are seeing significant crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during 2019 more than 40 of transactions across expedia group’s retail ota brands were booked on a mobile device 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model in addition our vrbo business facilitates alternative accommodation bookings earning per transaction commissions traveler service fees or a combination and provides subscriptionbased and other ancillary services to property owners and managers 

under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms alternative accommodations airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings the majority of our merchant transactions relate to lodging bookings under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia group in advance under our merchant contract expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect growth in our etp contracts has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs and as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering we have made adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions to the extent these dynamics continue we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through various of our expedia groupbranded and other multiproduct websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers typically select packages based on the total package price or by purchasing one product and receiving a discounted price to attach additional products the use of the merchant travel components in packages and 

multiproduct purchases enable us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings across several of our transactionbased websites as well as on our majorityowned metasearch site trivago 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies property owners and managers large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines destination service providers and other travel partners we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

we developed proprietary technology to assist hotel suppliers in managing pricing and marketing their supply our “direct connect” technology allows hotels to upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems and to automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers proprietary marketing tools assist hotels in tailoring demand to their requirements and our revenue management product provides pricing insight based on expedia group data and analytics our suite of white label website offerings power hotel package and meeting space booking on suppliers own websites 

in addition vrbos alternative accommodation listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers which enables them to manage an availability calendar reservations inquiries and the content of the listing as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers and customers that come directly to our websites 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media websites brand advertising through online and offline channels loyalty programs mobile apps and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include hotelscom rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia ® rewards on over 40 brand expedia points of sale as well as orbitz rewards on orbitzcom the cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing several of our branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make 

travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia hotelscom or vrbo cobranded offering or a private label website our expedia partner solutions business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

operations and technology 

we operate several technology platforms that support our brands the brand expedia technology platform supports our fullservice and multiproduct brands including brand expedia orbitz travelocity wotif group cheaptickets ebookers and expedia local expert as well as certain parts of the hotwire brand the hotelscom technology platform supports our hotelonly offering including hotelscom and expedia partner solutions in addition we operate egencia our corporate travel platform vrbo our alternative accommodations platform and trivago the metasearch platform 

all of our transactionbased brands share and benefit from our ecommerce platform infrastructure including customer support data centers and transaction processing capabilities 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located in several countries throughout the world we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward in addition we have continued to invest in technologies to provide automation powered by artificial intelligence selfservice capabilities and online customer service options to our customers through our websites and apps 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have 24hour monitoring and engineering support these data centers have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities additionally we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia group and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia group is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation websites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks copyright domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands domain names and website urls software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us we also protect some inventions and methods by maintaining them as trade secrets either because it provides superior and potentially longertermed protection or because the invention is not patentable but provides us with a competitive advantage 

in connection with our copyrightable content we post and institute procedures under the digital millennium copyright act and similar host privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs text and other content uploaded by users however differences between statutes limitations on immunity and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the alternative accommodation industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

we are also subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa came into force in january 2020 which applies enhanced data protection requirements in the state of california similar to those that have existed since 2018 under the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr similar laws are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions in addition 

certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our business

 part i item 1a risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities if any of the following risks occur our business andor financial performance could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

industry and operational risks 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional providers of travelrelated services including 



online and traditional travel agencies  we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies “otas” in many regions such as booking holdings and its subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom and tripcom which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in addition our ota competitors are increasingly expanding the range of travel services they offer and the global ota segment continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships we also compete with traditional travel agencies operating both offline and online wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers travel suppliers may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them many of these competitors such as hotels airlines and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia group sites for instance several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotel search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications some lowcost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and some airlines have attempted to apply or may apply surcharges for bookings made outside their own websites in recent years certain hotel chains have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as favorable rates increased or exclusive product availability complimentary wifi and their own bonus miles or loyalty points or in the case of airlines promote hotel supply at their websites which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours consolidation of travel suppliers may tend to exacerbate such negative effects on our businesses 

search engines and large online portal websites we also face increasing competition from google and other search engines there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance to the extent that google uses its market position to 

 in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas for example google has continued to add features and functionality to its travel metasearch products “google travel” “google flights” and “hotel ads” which are growing rapidly and has integrated reservation functionality into the hotel ads product in addition google may be able to leverage the data they collect on users to the detriment of us and other otas search engines also may continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our brands or brands in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivago compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and larger client bases than we do we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch websites travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of booking holdings trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia group tripadvisor skyscanner and qunar both are subsidiaries of tripcom aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch websites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise or if ota 

advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago’s metasearch marketplace trivago’s business and therefore our results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express global business travel gbt as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile and other platform travel applications the demand for and functionality of smartphones tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

applications and social media websites applications and social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition 

ecommerce and group buying websites traditional consumer ecommerce platforms including amazon and alibaba and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market for example traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites to the extent our travelers use these websites these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

alternative accommodations airbnb booking holdings and other providers of alternative accommodations that facilitate the shortterm rental of homes and apartments from owners provide an alternative to hotel rooms and compete with alternative accommodation properties available through expedia group brands including vrbo the continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and alternative accommodations furthermore airbnb and similar websites could increasingly look to add other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional otas 

other participants in the travel industry other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services we offer to our travelers our travel industry affiliates and partners or our corporate clients for example ridesharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate to the extent any of these services gain market share over time it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in evolving channels and platforms offering new consumer choices including inventory types and transactional models as well as increasing supplier inventory on our existing platforms if we fail to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments our business could be adversely affected our attempts to adapt our current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives different legal or tax requirements inadequate return on investments difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto our platforms as well as limiting our ability to develop new site features in addition adaptations to our business may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs and increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers in addition these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we rely heavily on internet search engines such as google through the purchase of travelrelated keywords and through organic search to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the placement or cost of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch websites including kayak tripadvisor and trivago pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or display of results which could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit participation in the search query results in particular google has in the past and may continue to in the future change its algorithms or results in a manner that has negatively affected the search engine ranking paid and unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates and those of our thirdparty distribution partners which has adversely impacted our business and financial performance google has also increasingly added its own travel search functionality and content at the expense of traditional paid listings and organic search results which may continue to reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates if google or other search or metasearch companies continue to pursue these or similar strategies which is out of our control or we do not successfully manage our paid and unpaid search strategies we could face a significant decrease in traffic to our websites andor increased costs related to replacing unpaid traffic with paid traffic 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers including owners and managers of alternative accommodation properties and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers airlines and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous supplier contracts 

no assurances can be given that travel suppliers will elect to participate in our platform or that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services for example average daily rates “adrs” or ticket prices attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels tending to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns as well as to disruptions due to other factors including those discussed below decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example during regional or global recessions domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slow spending on the services we provide and have a negative impact on our revenue growth additionally if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions andor significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the us dollar it can lead to a negative impact on our foreign denominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars 

further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance political instability including the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union brexit bans on travel from certain countries to the united states geopolitical conflicts trade disputes significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and adrs decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

other factors that could negatively affect our business potentially materially include 

 because these events or concerns and the full impact of their effects are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers and decrease demand d ecrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity war or travelrelated health events could result in significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions and travelrelated health events provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

with respect to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak specifically we currently expect that our first quarter 2020 financial results will be negatively impacted potentially to a material degree in addition as of the time of this annual report on form 10k we expect the 2019 novel coronavirus will continue to negatively impact our businesses beyond the first quarter of 2020 but the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken including mobility restrictions and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing   

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base in existing and emerging markets we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including 

 in recent years certain online travel companies and metasearch websites expanded their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically resulting in less direct traffic and increased customer acquisition costs moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia group portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio in addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we are subject to paymentsrelated and fraud risks 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity moreover there can be no assurances that the interchange rates or the fees we pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce our revenue thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

in addition credit card networks such as visa mastercard and american express have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include payment card association operating rules the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss under these rules we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use storage and security of card data we assess our compliance with the pci dss rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments and be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and our business and operating results could be adversely affected for existing and future payment options we offer to both our customers and suppliers we are and may increasingly be subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes such as the eu’s payment services directive 2 that could result in significant costs to us and our suppliers and reduce the ease of use of our payments options 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones tablet computers and inhome assistants and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia partner solutions business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of applicable laws or governmental authorities or experience information security breaches affecting our customers it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their 

actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers upon which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue has increased from 39 in 2010 to 43 in 2019 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we begin to operate in new markets and countries we must tailor our services business models and functional compliance structures to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences as well as the regulatory and tax landscapes of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 



acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired private companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends 

on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and peter kern our vice chairman are critical to the overall management of the company since the departure of the company’s chief executive officer in december 2019 messrs diller and kern have overseen the company’s executive leadership team and managed daytoday operations while the board of directors determines the longterm leadership of the company 

our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia group cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr kern or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees for example additional barriers to or restrictions on travel for professional or personal purposes such as those in the united states in early 2017 may cause significant disruption to our businesses or negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis in addition we moved our corporate headquarters from bellevue washington to seattle washington in late 2019 which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain certain employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our plans to increase our operational efficiencies and our restructuring efforts may adversely affect our business 

during 2019 we initiated a restructuring of portions of our global workforce in an effort to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and the operation of our overall businesses and in february 2020 we announced our intention to pursue operating cost savings by further simplifying our organization streamlining priorities and operating more efficiently 

we may not achieve our targeted operational cost savings improvements and efficiencies which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in addition implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements andor cost reductions these risks include among others higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans management distraction from ongoing business activities failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans damage to our reputation and brand image additionally as a result of restructuring initiatives we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge andor inefficiency adverse effects on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees any of these consequences could adversely impact our business 

legal and regulatory risks 

our alternative accommodations business is subject to regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

our alternative accommodations business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments that affect the alternative accommodation industry and the ability of companies like us to list those alternative accommodations online for example certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit or limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or that regulate short term rental platforms’ ability to list alternative accommodations including prohibiting the listing of unlicensed properties other domestic and foreign jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm rentals in addition many of the laws that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and the alternative accommodation industry which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our alternative accommodations business and results of operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia group’s operations and financial results 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and alternative accommodation licensing and listing requirements the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection licensing and regulations relating to the offer of travel 

insurance and related products anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security the provision of payment services and privacy as a result regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities or requirements for licensing 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally additionally some jurisdictions have implemented or are considering implementing regulations that restrict or could restrict access to city centers and popular destinations as well as impact our ability to offer accommodations such as by limiting the construction of new hotels or renting of alternative accommodations 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations antimoney laundering and anticorruption laws across industries us economic sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries including cuba iran north korea syria and nationals and others of those countries ukrainerussia related sanctions as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities we believe that our activities comply with ofac european union united kingdom and other regulatory authorities’ economic sanction and trade regulations as well as antimoney laundering anticorruption regulations and export controls including the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act the uk criminal finances act and the us export administration regulations as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities for example on may 17 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with ofac regarding 2221 potentially noncompliant cubarelated travel transactions that occurred between 20112014 which we voluntarily disclosed to ofac in 2014 in connection with the settlement agreement we made significant enhancements to our economic sanctions compliance program and associated controls ofac agreed to release us without any finding of fault from all civil liability in connection with the potential violations in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries or legal proceedings from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with economic sanctions consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia group and the presentation of information to consumers as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  competition and consumer matters the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us at a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new or changed interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

furthermore our future growth may be limited by antitrust or competition laws for example our business has grown and continues to expand and as a consequence increases in our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of various domestic and international income and nonincome including digital service tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities these taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues this has contributed to an 

increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities and has also resulted in legislative action including new taxes on digital services and revenue and through other indirect taxes as such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax reserves result in double taxation multiple levels of taxation or may require us to modify our business practices and incur additional cost to comply any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits andor levied assessments asserting we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy state and local sales or use taxes or other taxes including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple jurisdictions regarding the application of value addedgoods and services tax to our transactions while we believe we comply with applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we facilitate travel reservations tax authorities may conclude we owe additional taxes and issue tax assessments 

we have in the past been required and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity the payments may be substantial this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest a description of recent significant “paytoplay” payments and refunds as well as ongoing tax inquiries or audits in other “paytoplay” jurisdictions is included in note 17 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges including the amount of or basis for such charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes for example in 2019 the irs notified us of a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in connection with the examination of the 20112013 tax years although we disagree with the irs’ position and are challenging the adjustments the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results we believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations additionally jurisdictions seeking to tax the same income may disagree and relief may not be available through competent authority or other mechanisms resulting in double taxation multiple levels of taxation or additional obligations prospectively or retrospectively which could subject us to additional material tax interest and penalties 

brexit may create additional indirect tax implications for our business there is uncertainty as to the terms of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and the operation and application of relevant tax laws in the context of the withdrawal agreement scenarios depending upon the outcome we may have a material and adverse impact to our business 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of domestic or international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

many of the underlying laws rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the digital economy certain jurisdictions have enacted new tax laws rules and regulations directed at the digital economy and multinational businesses if existing tax laws rules or regulations are amended or if new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations are enacted including with respect to occupancy sales valueadded taxes digital services tax withholding taxes revenue based taxes unclaimed property or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy or multinational businesses the results of these changes could increase our tax liabilities possible outcomes include double taxation multiple levels of taxation or additional obligations prospectively or retrospectively including the potential imposition of interest and penalties demand for our products and services could decrease if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions the outcome of these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws that require online digital platforms to report user activity or collect and remit taxes from some or all of the travel suppliers listing on the online platform or for which we make remittances we periodically receive requests from tax authorities for information regarding accommodation providers listing on some of our sites as well as traveler information along with details of certain transactions booked through our sites and in some cases we have been legally 

obligated to provide this data the cost or potential lack of ability to comply with these new rules and information requests may harm our business 

corporate tax reform baseerosion prevention efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in several jurisdictions for example the 2017 tax cut and jobs act “tax act” reformed us corporate income taxes and among other things reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 but imposed baseerosion prevention measures as well as a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings in general changes in tax laws may affect our tax rate increase our tax liabilities carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities 

in october 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to “base erosion and profit shifting” “beps” by multinational companies multiple member jurisdictions including countries in which we operate have implemented recommended changes such as country by country reporting “cbcr” the cbcr standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies the cbcr disclosure is expected to result in increased global tax audit activity 

over the past two years the oecd has proposed measures to address the application of corporate tax to companies operating in the digital economy as the oecd continues its evaluation several territories both within and outside the european union “eu” have enacted or proposed measures to introduce new digital services taxes on companies such as the 3 digital services tax in france these taxes are incremental to the taxes historically incurred by the company and result in taxation of the same revenue in multiple countries the enacted and proposed measures could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years including but not limited to increased disclosure of company activities and the introduction of other new taxes specifically targeting the digital economy certain countries have adopted or have proposed the adoption of unilateral changes thus increasing the risk of double taxation or multiple layers of taxation without relief any changes to us or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of our revenue or earnings and adversely affect our profitability our tax liabilities in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of revenue and earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with as appropriate relevant governmental authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws rules and regulations however due to the increasing pace of legislative changes and the large scale of our business activities any substantial changes in tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay our financial condition and results of operations generally 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and disputes involving taxes personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions has been and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and the outcomes of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites and mobile applications rely on content brands domain names and technology much of which is proprietary we establish and protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark domain name copyright trade secret and patent laws in the us and other jurisdictions license and confidentiality agreements and internal policies and procedures in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information and intellectual property even with these precautions however it may be 

possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark domain name copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems in many areas of our business including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity marketing communications procurement payments tax collection and remittance fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings cloud computing the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes including new devices services and home assistants such as amazon’s echo and alexa voice and google home and developing technologies such as machine learning artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technologies have and will continue to require new and costly investments transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers for example we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services 

in addition we may not be successful or may be less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as a service solutions could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner 

we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms such as cloud computing services to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site features in addition during the migration process the sites have in the past and may continue in the future to experience reduced functionality decreases in conversion rates and increased costs relating to maintaining redundant systems also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems or enhancements to existing infrastructure technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on information technology systems including the internet and thirdparty hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities and to transmit and store data including booking transactions intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and invoicing information and the collection of payments accounting procurement and supply chain activities in addition we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including through spyware viruses phishing denial of service and similar attacks by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent in addition as we continue to migrate legacy systems to new or existing information technology systems we increase the risk of system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon  including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers  and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our customers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses additionally as part of our technology migration we are becoming increasingly reliant upon amazon web services as a single cloud computing infrastructure platform and any disruption to our use of amazon web services could negatively impact our business operations 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business we devote significant resources to network security monitoring and testing employee training and other security measures but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information intellectual property proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in our operations we will need to continue to expend additional significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and a security breach resulting in the reduction of website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently are often not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to our contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users and our business partners to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands our failure to quickly respond to or adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for our own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

in addition no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances furthermore many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time in addition any remediation efforts may be costly for which we may not have adequate insurance to cover such losses or costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

we process store and use customer supplier and employee personal financial and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use theft or destruction 

we process store and use customer and employee personal financial and other data obtained from users of our websites and mobile applications and from our administrative functions there are numerous laws regarding the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal financial and other data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive 

to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of our businesses and we may have difficulty complying with strict timelines imposed by jurisdictions for these obligations 

any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use theft or destruction of such data may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans in addition such an event could result in violations of applicable us and international laws governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation such events could also subject us to bank fines penalties or increased transaction costs damage our reputation and brands impair our relationships with current and potential business partners and key service providers all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to privacy regulations and compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online some us states including california have passed comprehensive privacy legislation or are considering privacy legislation in addition the european union’s recently adopted privacy and data security regulation the general data protection regulation or gdpr that went into effect in may 2018 requires companies to implement and remain compliant with regulations regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves at least 12 additional countries in asia eastern europe and latin america have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted some jurisdictions have also adopted regulations governing the use of “cookies” by websites serving consumers which could adversely impact the way we serve customers and advertise in these jurisdictions we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to comply with the gdpr and other privacy laws and regulations failure to meet any of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or legal liability adverse publicity andor damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

financial and market risks 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in accommodation revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see growth in both our merchant expedia collect and our agency hotel collect hotel products to the extent our merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline it would likely result in pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar 

ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have outstanding longterm indebtedness excluding current maturities with a face value of 42 billion and we have a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 risks relating to our indebtedness include 

 the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2019 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 23 billion primarily in bank of america the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj bnp paribas hsbc jpmorgan chase and standard chartered bank and held term deposits of approximately 13 billion at financial institutions including australia and new zealand banking group limited hsbc mizuho bank ltd the bank of nova scotia and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 151 million primarily in bnp paribas and deutsche bank and held term deposits of approximately 118 million at deutsche bank as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2019 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 32 billion the fair value of which was a liability of approximately 8 million the counterparties to these contracts were primarily australia and new zealand banking group bank of america jp morgan chase citibank hsbc royal bank of canada us bank mizuho bank ltd standard chartered bank societe generale and wells fargo we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these term deposits or forward contracts in addition we face 

significant credit risk and potential payment delays with respect to nonfinancial contract counterparties including our expedia partner solutions and vrbo partners which may be exacerbated by economic downturns the realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

governance risks 

mr diller may be deemed to beneficially own shares representing approximately 29 of the outstanding voting power of expedia group and has the right to purchase or exchange for additional shares of expedia group class b common stock 

as of december 31 2019 mr diller may be deemed to have beneficially owned 100 of expedia group’s outstanding class b common stock representing approximately 29 of the total voting power of all shares of expedia group common stock and class b common stock outstanding in addition pursuant to his purchaseexchange right mr diller has the right to purchase from expedia group or exchange with expedia group an equivalent number of shares of expedia group common stock for an additional 7276547 shares of expedia class b common stock assuming the exercise of such right in full by mr diller and assuming he is deemed to beneficially own the expedia group shares held by the family foundation mr diller would beneficially own shares of expedia group class b common stock collectively representing approximately 50 of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of expedia group common stock and expedia group class b common stock assuming a total of approximately 130 million shares of expedia group common stock and 12799999 shares of expedia group class b common stock outstanding immediately following the exercise of such right if mr diller were to exercise his purchaseexchange right solely by exchanging shares of expedia group common stock acquired in the open market or otherwise other than from expedia group if mr diller were to acquire the additional shares through cash purchases directly from expedia group mr diller would beneficially own shares of expedia group class b common stock collectively representing approximately 48 of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of expedia group common stock and expedia group class b common stock 

in the future mr diller’s ownership percentage in expedia group could increase if he exercises his purchaseexchange right or buys additional shares of expedia group common stock in open market purchases or otherwise or if expedia group repurchases shares of its common stock however upon transfer any additional shares will automatically convert into expedia group common stock unless mr diller retains sole voting control over such transferred additional shares additionally all additional shares will automatically convert into shares of expedia group common stock immediately following the earliest of a mr diller’s death or disability b such time as mr diller no longer serves as chairman or senior executive of expedia group other than as a result of his removal other than for “cause” as defined in the new governance agreement or failure to be nominated or elected when he is willing to serve in such position and c aggregate transfers by mr diller or certain limited permitted transferees of mr diller of original shares exceeding 5 of the outstanding voting power of expedia group 

therefore while it is possible that mr diller may at some point in the future beneficially own more than 50 of the outstanding voting power of expedia group the provisions of the new governance agreement and expedia group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that following one of the triggers described above the number of shares of expedia group class b common stock outstanding and acquired by mr diller and the family foundation in the exchange or pursuant to the purchaseexchange right will not exceed approximately 55 million shares of expedia group class b common stock or approximately 29 of the total voting power of expedia group based on approximately 137 million shares of expedia group common stock and approximately 55 million shares of expedia group class b common stock outstanding as of december 31 2019 moreover under the new governance agreement and expedia group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation subject to limited exception no current or future holder of original shares or additional shares may participate in or vote in favor of or tender shares into any change of control transaction involving at least 50 of the outstanding shares or voting power of capital stock of expedia group unless such transaction provides for the same per share consideration and mix of consideration or election right and the same participation rights for shares of expedia group class b common stock and shares of expedia group common stock additionally the new governance agreement does not provide mr diller with any consent rights over corporate actions or matters 

mr diller is also currently the chairman of expedia group’s board of directors and senior executive of expedia group expedia group’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the chairman of the board may only be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of at least 80 of the entire board of directors which provision may not be amended altered changed or repealed or any provision inconsistent therewith adopted without the approval of at least 1 80 of the entire board of directors and 2 80 of the voting power of expedia group’s outstanding voting securities voting together as a single class 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and the governance arrangements between mr diller and expedia group mr diller is in a position to influence and potentially control significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets additionally in the future another holder of the original shares might have such a position of influence by virtue of ownership interests in the original shares this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to expedia group stockholders 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia group management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iacinteractivecorp or iac ms clinton and messrs kaufman and von furstenberg also serve as members of the board of directors of both expedia group and iac these overlapping relationships could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for the directors or officers when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia group mr diller in particular may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between the companies 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia group who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia group because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group

in europe investigations or inquiries into contractual parity provisions between hotels and online travel companies including expedia group companies were initiated in 2012 2013 and 2014 by ncas in austria belgium czech republic denmark france germany greece hungary ireland italy poland sweden and switzerland while the ultimate outcome of some of these investigations or inquiries remains uncertain and the expedia group companies’ circumstances are distinguishable from other online travel companies subject to similar investigations and inquiries we note in this context that on april 21 2015 the french italian and swedish ncas working in close cooperation with the european commission announced that they had accepted formal commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve and close the investigations against bookingcom in france italy and sweden by bookingcom removing andor modifying certain rate conditions and availability parity provisions in its contracts with accommodation providers in france italy and sweden as of july 1 2015 among other commitments bookingcom voluntarily extended the geographic scope of these commitments to accommodation providers throughout europe as of the same date 

with effect from august 1 2015 expedia group companies waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with european hotel partners for a period of five years while the expedia group companies maintain that their parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law these waivers were nevertheless implemented as a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis following the implementation of the expedia group companies waivers nearly all ncas in europe have announced either the closure of their investigation or inquiries involving expedia group companies or a decision not to open an investigation or inquiry involving expedia group companies below are descriptions of additional rate parityrelated matters of note in europe 

the german federal cartel office “fco” has required another online travel company hotel reservation service “hrs” to remove certain clauses from its contracts with hotels hrs’ appeal of this decision was rejected by the higher regional court düsseldorf on january 9 2015 on december 23 2015 the fco announced that it had also required bookingcom by way of an infringement decision to remove certain clauses from its contracts with german hotels bookingcom has appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the higher regional court düsseldorf on february 8 2017 on june 4 2019 the higher regional court düsseldorf issued its judgment in this matter and ruled that certain parity clauses are in compliance with applicable german and european competition rules and the fco’s prohibition order against bookingcom was annulled the decision is not yet final as the fco has applied to the german federal supreme court to admit an appeal from the decision the fco’s case against the expedia group companies’ contractual parity provisions with 

accommodation providers in germany remains open but is still at a preliminary stage with no formal allegations of wrongdoing having been communicated to the expedia group companies to date 

the italian competition authoritys case closure decision against bookingcom and expedia group companies has subsequently been appealed by two italian hotel trade associations ie federalberghi and aica these appeals remain at an early stage and no hearing date has been fixed 

on november 6 2015 the swiss competition authority announced that it had issued a final decision finding certain parity terms existing in previous versions of agreements between swiss hotels and each of certain expedia group companies bookingcom and hrs to be prohibited under swiss law the decision explicitly notes that the expedia group companies current contract terms with swiss hotels are not subject to this prohibition the swiss competition authority imposed no fines or other sanctions against the expedia group companies and did not find an abuse of a dominant market position by the expedia group companies 

on december 10 2019 the french competition authority dismissed all antitrust complaints filed by hotel unions and accor against expedia group companies regarding mfns and other alleged business practices 

the directorate general for competition consumer affairs and repression of fraud the “dgccrf” a directorate of the french ministry of economy and finance with authority over unfair trading practices brought a lawsuit in france against expedia group companies objecting to certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia group companies and french hotels in may 2015 the french court ruled that certain of the parity provisions in certain contracts that were the subject of the lawsuit were not in compliance with french commercial law but imposed no fine and no injunction the dgccrf appealed the decision and on june 21 2017 the paris court of appeal published a judgment overturning the decision the court annulled parity clauses contained in the agreements at issue ordered the expedia group companies to amend their contracts and imposed a fine the expedia group companies have appealed the decision that appeal remains pending 

hotelverband deutschland “iha” ev a german hotel association brought proceedings before the cologne regional court against expedia inc expediacom gmbh and expedia lodging partner services sàrl iha applied for a ‘cease and desist’ order against these companies in relation to the enforcement of certain rate and availability parity clauses contained in contracts with hotels in germany on or around february 16 2017 the court dismissed iha’s action and declared the claimant liable for the expedia group defendants’ statutory costs iha appealed the decision and on december 4 2017 the court of appeals rejected iha’s appeal the court of appeals expressly confirmed that expedia group’s mfns are in compliance both with european and german competition law while iha had indicated an intention to appeal the decision to the federal supreme court it has not lodged an appeal within the applicable deadline with the consequence that the court of appeals judgment has now become final 

a working group of 10 european ncas belgium czech republic denmark france hungary ireland italy netherlands sweden and the united kingdom and the european commission has been established by the european competition network “ecn” at the end of 2015 to monitor the functioning of the online hotel booking sector following amendments made by a number of online travel companies including bookingcom and expedia group companies in relation to certain parity provisions in their contracts with hotels the working group issued questionnaires to online travel agencies including expedia group companies metasearch sites and hotels in 2016 the underlying results of the ecn monitoring exercise were published on april 6 2017 

legislative bodies in france july 2015 austria december 2016 italy august 2017 and belgium august 2018 have also adopted new domestic antiparity clause legislation expedia group believes each of these pieces of legislation violates both eu and national legal principles and therefore expedia group companies have challenged these laws at the european commission a motion requesting the swiss government to take action on narrow price parity has been adopted in the swiss parliament the swiss government is now required to draft legislation implementing the motion the company is unable to predict whether and with what content legislation will ultimately be adopted and if so when this might be the case it is not yet clear how any adopted domestic antiparity clause legislations andor any possible future legislation in this area may affect expedia groups business 

outside of europe a number of ncas have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including expedia group companies a brazilian hotel sector association  forum de operadores hoteleiros do brasil  filed a complaint with the brazilian administrative council for economic defence “cade” against a number of online travel companies including bookingcom decolarcom and expedia group companies on july 27 2016 with respect to parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies on september 13 2016 the expedia group companies submitted a response to the complaint to cade on march 27 2018 the expedia group companies resolved cade’s concerns based on a settlement implementing waivers substantially similar to those provided to accommodation providers in europe in late 2016 expedia 

group companies resolved the concerns of the australia and new zealand ncas based on implementation of the waivers substantially similar to those provided to accommodation providers in europe on september 1 2016 in australia and on october 28 2016 in new zealand more recently however the australian nca has reopened its investigation on and with effect from march 22 2019 expedia group voluntarily and unilaterally waived certain additional rate parity provisions in agreements with australian hotel partners the accc confirmed it has ceased its investigation into expedia group companies’ conduct in relation to such rate parity provisions in around november 2019 expedia group companies are in ongoing discussions with a limited number of ncas in other countries in relation to their contracts with hotels in april 2019 the japan fair trade commission “jftc” launched an investigation into certain practices of a number of online travel companies including expedia group companies expedia group is cooperating with the jftc in this investigation the hong kong competition commission hkcc is conducting an investigation into certain terms and conditions in contracts entered into between online travel companies including expedia group companies and hotels expedia group is cooperating with the hkcc in this investigation expedia group is currently unable to predict the impact the implementation of the waivers both in europe and elsewhere will have on expedia groups business on investigations or inquiries by ncas in other countries or on industry practice more generally 

in addition regulatory authorities in europe including the uk competition and markets authority or “cma” australia and elsewhere have initiated legal proceedings andor undertaken market studies inquiries or investigations relating to online marketplaces and how information is presented to consumers using those marketplaces including practices such as search results rankings and algorithms discount claims  disclosure of charges and availability and similar messaging 

on june 28 2018 the cma announced that it will be requiring hotel booking websites to take action to address concerns identified in the course of its ongoing investigation after consulting with the cma on january 31 2019 we agreed to offer certain voluntary undertakings with respect to the presentation of information on certain of our uk consumerfacing websites in order to address the cma’s concerns on february 4 2019 the cma confirmed that as a result of the undertakings offered it has closed its investigation without any admission or finding of liability the undertakings become effective on september 1 2019 on october 21 2019 the italian competition authority announced that it had accepted expedia’s voluntary undertakings with respect to the presentation of information on its italian website and closed the proceedings against expedia without any admission or finding of liability the undertakings became effective on september 1 2019 

on august 23 2018 the australian competition and consumer commission or accc instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law or acl relating to trivago’s advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s australian site trivago’s strikethrough pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivagos australian website the matter went to trial in september 2019 and on january 20 2020 the australian federal court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the acl the court will set a date for a separate hearing regarding penalties and other orders we recorded the estimated probable loss associated with the proceedings as of december 31 2019 an estimate for the reasonable possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made 

we are cooperating with regulators in the investigations described above where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect such actions will have on our business industry practices or online commerce more generally other than described above we have not accrued a reserve in connection with the market studies investigations inquiries or legal proceedings described above either because the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of any loss is not estimable

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2017 and 2018 represented years of continuing growth for the travel industry while 2019 has seen continued growth for the industry it has been at a slower pace than in prior years additionally political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues natural disasters macroeconomic concerns and particularly the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future with respect to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak specifically we currently expect that our first quarter 2020 financial results will be negatively impacted potentially to a material degree in addition as of the time of this annual report on form 10k we expect that the 2019 novel coronavirus will continue to negatively impact our businesses beyond the first quarter of 2020 but the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken including mobility restrictions and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet are driving rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2020 approximately 50 of us and european leisure and unmanaged corporate travel expenditures are expected to occur online online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of the united states and europe these penetration rates increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business while also attracting many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google evidenced by continued product enhancements including new trip planning features for users and the integration of its various travel products into the google travel offering as well as further prioritizing its own products in search results competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom owned by booking holdings trivago in which expedia group owns a majority interest as well as tripadvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools further airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services in addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry businesses such as airbnb vrbo previously homeaway which expedia group acquired in december 2015 and bookingcom owned by booking holdings have emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market many other competitors including vacation rental metasearch players continue to emerge in this space which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding 

hotel offers to their websites for additional detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face see part i item 1 business  competition and part i item 1a risk factors  we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment” 

the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia group facilitates both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agencyonly contracts as well as our hybrid etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our marketing spending on a brand basis making decisions in each applicable market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity and the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in many international markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive in addition the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing traveler mind share for more detail see part i item 1a risk factors  we rely on the value of our brands and the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing” and “our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally” 

lodging 

lodging includes hotel accommodations and alternative accommodations as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019 lodging accounted for 70 our room night growth has been healthy with room nights growing 16 in 2017 13 in 2018 and 11 in 2019 adrs for rooms booked on expedia group websites increased 3 in 2017 5 in 2018 and decreased 1 in 2019 the decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange more recently we have seen pressure on a local currency basis on adrs similar to the recent trends for hotel companies 

hotel we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states remain high compared to historical levels however us hotel supply has continued to grow which may put additional pressure on adrs in addition macroeconomic factors could also influence adr trends in some international markets hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions in addition the increase in alternative accommodations space could pressure hotel adrs further while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups in the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on thirdparty websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi 

we have continued to add supply to our global lodging marketplace with nearly 16 million properties on our global websites as of december 31 2019 including over 765000 integrated vrbo alternative accommodations listings 

alternative accommodations with our acquisition of vrbo previously homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market vrbo is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group vrbo has been undergoing a transition from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology vrbo offers hosts subscriptionbased listing or payperbooking service models it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings as of december 31 2019 there are over 21 million online bookable listings available on vrbo in addition we have actively moved to integrate vrbo listings into our global ota services as well as directly add 

alternative accommodation listings to our offerings to position our key global brands to offer a full range of lodging options for consumers 

air 

significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the us air carriers further strengthening their position however in 2017 and into 2018 there was evidence of discounting by the us carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results starting in the second half of 2018 there has been evidence of modest fare increases the airline industry experienced more constrained supply particularly in the second half of 2019 which was also a factor it remains unclear if this trend will continue ticket prices on expedia group websites declined 1 in 2017 increased 2 in 2018 and were flat in 2019 based on airline reports demand for airline tickets seems to be strong helping increase air revenue globally there is significant correlation between airline revenue and fuel prices and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenue given current volatility it is uncertain how fuel prices could impact airfares we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine certain supply agreements renew and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets 

air ticket volumes increased 4 in 2017 5 in 2018 and 7 in 2019 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2019 air accounted for 7 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch website in addition to expedia group media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2019 we generated a total of 11 billion of advertising and media revenue a slight increase from 2018 representing 9 of our total worldwide revenue in 2018 trivago shifted its operational focus reducing marketing spend to better balance revenue and profit growth the lower marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth while benefiting profitability this trend continued in 2019 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel services including merchant and agency hotel is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business historically vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago have typically been experienced in the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring summer and winter holiday travel as a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix including the growth of vrbo may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in shortterm impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends as vrbo has further shifted to a predominately transactionbased business model for alternative accommodations listings and due to its elongated booking window its seasonal trends are more pronounced than our other traditional leisure businesses 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

deferred loyalty rewards 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom rewards program our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on over 40 brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points net of expected breakage as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors including fluctuations in reward value product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior 

business combinations 

we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and if applicable record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present 

value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the 

largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy and other taxes  some states and localities impose taxes eg transient occupancy accommodation tax sales tax andor business privilege tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in most jurisdictions we do not collect or remit taxes nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes more recently a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against vrbo for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on vrbo’s services vrbo is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 10000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy and other taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

historically our primary form of employee stockbased compensation was stock option awards our employee stock options consist of service based awards some of which also have marketbased vesting conditions we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques including the blackscholes and monte carlo optionpricing models for awards that contain marketbased vesting conditions we amortize the fair value over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of servicebased awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straightline basis we account for forfeitures as they occur the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in ten lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes andor ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or other accommodations 

recent developments include 

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 48 million as of december 31 2019 and 46 million as of december 31 2018  

certain jurisdictions including without limitation the states of new york new jersey north carolina minnesota oregon rhode island maryland pennsylvania hawaii iowa massachusetts arizona wisconsin idaho the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel andor other accommodations andor car rental in addition in certain jurisdictions we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state andor local taxing jurisdictions we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including without limitation the states of new york new jersey south carolina north carolina minnesota georgia wyoming west virginia oregon rhode island montana maryland kentucky maine new jersey pennsylvania hawaii iowa massachusetts arizona wisconsin idaho colorado the city of new york and the district of columbia as well as certain other jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity for additional information see note 17 — commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings  paytoplay in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other jurisdictions we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities some of which including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes and the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax “vat” to our european union related transactions may impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

segments 

we have four reportable segments core online travel agencies “core ota” trivago vrbo and egencia our core ota segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia partner solutions orbitz travelocity wotif group ebookers cheaptickets hotwirecom carrentalscom classic vacations and silverrail our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites our vrbo segment operates an online marketplace for the alternative accommodations industry our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency merchant and vrbo transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

when vrbo properties are booked through our core ota websites and vice versa the segments split the thirdparty revenue for management and segment reporting purposes with the majority of the thirdparty revenue residing with the website marketing the property or room the operating metrics including gross bookings and room nights are not split but instead generally reside entirely with the website marketing the property or room 

gross bookings and revenue margin 



 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in the core ota segment including growth at expedia partner solutions which includes the benefit from enterprise deals launched in late 2018 and hotelscom 

results of operations 

revenue 



in 2019  revenue increased primarily driven by growth in the core ota segment including growth at expedia partner solutions hotelscom and brand expedia as well as growth at vrbo 



 

 lodging revenue increased 10 in 2019 on an 11 increase in room nights stayed driven by growth in hotelscom expedia partner solutions and brand expedia partially offset by a 1 decrease in revenue per room night 

air revenue decreased 1 in 2019 on an 8 decrease in revenue per ticket mostly offset by a 7 increase in air tickets sold the decrease in revenue per ticket was primarily related to changes in classification of certain fees a shift in product mix and a negative impact from foreign exchange the increase in air tickets sold was driven by growth at expedia partner solutions largely related to enterprise deals launched in late 2018 

advertising and media revenue increased 1 in 2019 due to growth at expedia group media solutions largely offset by declines in local currency revenue at trivago as well as negative impacts from foreign exchange 

all other revenue which includes car rental insurance destination services fees related to our corporate travel business and revenue related to bodybuildingcom increased by 6 in 2019 benefiting from the inorganic impact related to the acquisition of bodybuildingcom and the reclassification of certain partner fees from air revenue 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 



the increase in merchant revenue in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in room nights stayed 

the increase in agency revenue in 2019 was primarily due to the growth in agency hotel 

vrbo revenue increased 14 in 2019 compared to 2018 due to growth in transactional revenue of approximately 20 primarily driven by a benefit from the traveler service fee partially offset by subscription revenue decreasing approximately 10 

cost of revenue 



cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors 2 credit card processing including merchant fees fraud and chargebacks and 3 other costs primarily including data center and cloud costs to support our websites supplier operations destination supply certain transactional level taxes costs related to bodybuildingcom and stockbased compensation 

in 2019  the increase in cost of revenue expense was driven by 126 million of higher data center cloud and other costs primarily due to higher cloud expense and an inorganic impact related to the bodybuildingcom acquisition in addition customer operations expenses increased 58 million  

selling and marketing 



selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our various brands and global supply organization as well as stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses increased 368 million during 2019 compared to 2018 driven by an increase of  373 million of direct costs as a result of increases at expedia partner solutions as well as at vrbo and hotelscom partially offset by a decrease at trivago 

technology and content 



technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including cloud expense licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

technology and content expense increased 146 million for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher personnel and overhead costs of 45 million to support our investments in product and technology initiatives depreciation and amortization of technology assets also increased by 42 million  other costs increased 59 million yearoveryear primarily due to higher licensing and maintenance costs to support the growth of our technology platforms as well as higher cloud expenses 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation 

general and administrative expense increased 39 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by higher stockbased compensation of 23 million  which includes acceleration of expense related to the departure of our former ceo in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as higher professional fees and an inorganic impact related to bodybuildingcom 

amortization and impairment of intangible assets 



amortization of intangible assets decreased 85 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets 

in 2018 we recorded an impairment loss of 42 million and related to indefinitelived trade names within our core ota segment due to changes in estimated future revenue of the related brands 

impairment of goodwill 

during 2018 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 86 million related to a reporting unit within our core ota segment see note 4 — fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 



legal reserves occupancy tax and other primarily consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2019  we received a 10 million refund of prepaid paytoplay amounts from the state of hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation resulting in a corresponding benefit during the period which nets down increases in reserves for occupancy tax and other matters 

during 2018  we received a refund of prepaid paytoplay payments of 78 million from the city of san francisco and recorded a related gain in legal reserves occupancy tax and other which was partially offset by expense related to changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes for other jurisdictions 

for additional information see note 17 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and related reorganization charges 

in connection with the centralization and migration of certain operational functions and systems as well as certain organizational alignment activities we recognized 24 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2019 these charges were primarily related to severance benefits and professional fees during 2018 we did not recognize any restructuring and related reorganization charges 

operating income 



in 2019  operating income increased primarily due to growth in revenue in excess of operating costs including lower intangible amortization and the absence of impairment charges in 2019 partially offset by the 78 million gain recognized related to the san francisco paytoplay refund during 2018 

in 2020 we plan to pursue operating cost savings by simplifying our organization streamlining priorities and operating more efficiently we do not currently have an estimate of the savings we may realize during 2020 but expect to reach nearly the full runrate annualized savings opportunity by the end of 2020 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

 

1 includes immaterial operating results of bodybuildingcom subsequent to our acquisition on july 26 2019 

2 adjusted ebitda is a nongaap measure see definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda below for more information 

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric see note 20 — segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income loss attributable to expedia group inc for the periods presented above 

core ota adjusted ebitda increased 142 million during 2019  primarily due to an increase in revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses including an increase in direct sales and marketing expense 

trivago adjusted ebitda increased 69 million during 2019  beginning late in the second quarter of 2018 trivago started focusing on improved profitability and made significant reductions in its advertising spend as a result of this increased focus on reducing operating expenditures the negative marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth while benefiting profitability this trend continued in 2019 

vrbo adjusted ebitda decreased 7 million during 2019 as higher operating expenses mainly related to investments in direct marketing costs were partially offset by the increase in revenue 

egencia adjusted ebitda increased 9 million during 2019 as a result of growth in revenue as well as leverage on operating expenses 

unallocated overhead costs increased 49 million during 2019 primarily due to higher technology expenses as well as general and administrative expenses 

interest income and expense 



interest income decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of 19 million in interest income recognized in 2018 on the san francisco paytoplay refund mentioned above partially offset by higher invested balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return 

interest expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of the august 2018 maturity of our 500 million senior unsecured notes partially offset by additional interest on the 125 billion senior unsecured notes issued in september 2019 as of december 31 2019 and 2018  our senior unsecured notes indebtedness totaled 49 billion and 37 billion  respectively 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 



provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the 21 federal statutory income tax rate due to state income taxes foreign income taxed at higher than the federal statutory tax rate as well as losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we do not record a tax benefit our effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower as well as excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments and foreignderived intangible income fdii the increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in us federal and state taxable income as a result of an internal reorganization 

we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions during 2017 the internal revenue service “irs” issued proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2009 to 

2010 audit cycle on july 12 2019 we settled the audit for an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements in addition we are under examination by the irs for our 2011 through 2013 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2019 the irs issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 audit cycle the proposed adjustments would increase our us taxable income by 696 million which would result in federal tax of approximately 244 million subject to interest we do not agree with the position of the irs and are formally protesting the irs position subsequent years remain open to examination by the irs we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months related to these years 

for additional information including additional information on the impacts of the tax act see note 11 — income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters which may ultimately be settled in cash and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above in the legal proceedings section as well as the notes to the financial statements the nongaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to expedia group inc adjusted for 1 net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 provision for income taxes 3 total other expenses net 4 stockbased compensation expense including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans 5 acquisitionrelated impacts including i amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment ii gains losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements if any and iii upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree if any 6 certain other items including restructuring 7 items included in legal reserves occupancy tax and other 8 that portion of gains losses on revenue hedging activities that are included in other net that relate to revenue recognized in the period and 9 depreciation 

the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future ongoing performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments in addition we believe that by excluding certain items such as stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated impacts adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 

the reconciliation of net income attributable to expedia group inc to adjusted ebitda is as follows 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 38 billion and 25 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018  and our 2 billion revolving credit facility which is essentially untapped and expires in may 2023 

as of december 31 2019  the total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 10 billion 747 million in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries and 265 million in majorityowned subsidiaries the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the united states and for which future distributions could be taxable was 85 million as of december 31 2019  the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the us federal income tax consequences of these earnings was 18 million as of december 31 2019  

in september 2019 we privately placed 125 billion of senior unsecured notes that are due in february 2030 and bear interest at 325 the 325 notes the 325 notes were issued at 99225 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in arrears in february and august of each year beginning february 15 2020 we used or expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes which may include but are not limited to the repayment prepayment redemption or repurchase of our indebtedness including but not limited to our 595 senior notes due 2020 as well as working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions 

as of december 31 2019  we maintained a 2 billion revolving credit facility with a may 2023 maturity date interest is payable under the facility based on the companys credit ratings with the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts at libor plus 1125 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 15 basis points as of december 31 2019  the facility contains various restrictive covenants including a maximum permissible leverage ratio and a minimum permissible interest coverage ratio as of december 31 2019  the maximum permissible leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage were 400 to 100 and 275 to 100 respectively 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2019  moody’s rating was baa3 with an outlook of “positive” which was upgraded during the third quarter of 2019 from ba1 in connection with the closing of the liberty expedia transaction sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “watch negative” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt which was comprised of 750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 595 the “595 notes” 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 45 the “45 notes” euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 25 the 25 notes 750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 50 the 50 notes and the 1 billion of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2028 that bear interest at 38 the 38 notes and the 325 notes 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant lodging business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent to billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel advertising or certain expedia partner solutions relationships or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms including programs where we remit payment to suppliers in advance of the travelers stay or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by vrbos continued shift to become the merchant of record on more of its transactions 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp as well as the transformation of the vrbos alternative accommodation listing business may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2019  we had a deficit in our working capital of 30 billion  compared to a deficit of 29 billion as of december 31 2018  

we will continue to invest in capital at similar to increasing levels over time to improve our technology platforms infrastructure operational capabilities and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations in addition to the capital requirements in support of our business strategy our future capital requirements may also include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases or dividend payments among others thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt for the new headquarters we expect to spend approximately 900 million of the total approximately 290 million was spent between 2016 and 2018 and approximately 390 million was spent during 2019 during full year 2020 we expect to spend approximately 220 million 

our cash flows are as follows 



in 2019  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 792 million primarily due to increase in benefits from working capital changes mainly due to higher deferred merchant bookings at vrbo as it transitioned to the expedia group payment platform 

in 2019  994 million more cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net purchases of investments of 494 million in 2019 compared to net sales of investments of 334 million in 2018 and higher current year capital expenditures including amounts related to our new corporate headquarters 

cash provided by financing activities in 2019 primarily included 1231 billion of net proceeds for the issuance of the 325 notes in september 2019 as well as 301 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans partially offset by 400 million payment of debt assumed in the liberty expedia transaction cash dividend payments of 195 million and cash paid to acquire shares of 743 million  including the repurchased shares under the authorization discussed below as well as 24 million for repurchases with respect to the liberty expedia holdings transaction cash used in financing activities in 2018 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 923 million  the 500 million longterm debt repayment and a 186 million cash dividend payment partially offset by 166 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans 

during 2019 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock in each of the respective years during 2018 authorized a repurchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 105 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 



   

 as of december 31 2019  267 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases subsequent to december 31 2019  we repurchased an additional 34 million shares for a total cost of 370 million  excluding transaction costs representing an average purchase price of 10988 per share 

our common stock dividend was 132 per share for 2019  124 per share for 2018 and 116 per share for 2017  see note 13 — stockholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition in february 2020  the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of  034 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 26 2020 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10 2020  future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

foreign exchange rate changes resulted in immaterial increases of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2019 of 3 million  foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a reduction of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2018 of 139 million reflecting net depreciations in foreign currencies during 2018  

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates

in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 in september 2017 we issued 1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 38 in september 2019 we issued 125 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 325 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 595 notes 25 notes 45 notes 50 notes 38 notes and 325 notes were approximately 767 million  764 million  536 million  825 million  102 billion  121 billion and as of december 31 2019 as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 595 notes by approximately 2 million our 25 notes by approximately 8 million our 45 notes by approximately 11 million our 50 notes by approximately 21 million our 38 notes by approximately 35 million and our 325 notes by approximately 51 million 

we maintain a 2 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 or 2017  

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had a net forward liability of 8 million included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a net forward asset of 22 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 29 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings 

and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2019  as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2019  2018 and 2017  we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 34 million  34 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 3 million  38 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 46 million  40 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 more recently we have invested in migrating parts of our technology platform to the cloud as well as focused on expanding our lodging supply in key focus markets around the world our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia group’s worldwide traveler base makes our websites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience to drive improvements in conversion 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space for more than two decades each expedia group technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options we have made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that make it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace improvements in our global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia continue to enable us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands since 2014 we have acquired travelocity wotif group and orbitz worldwide including orbitz cheaptickets and ebookers and migrated their brands to the brand expedia technology platform in addition orbitz for business customers were migrated to the egencia technology platform in 2016 in 2015 we acquired homeaway inc including all of its brands we intend to continue leveraging these technology investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

channel expansion technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends and many of our brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional pcs mobile bookings continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed with a much shorter booking window than we historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods additionally our brands are implementing new technologies like voicebased search chatbots and messaging apps as mobilebased options for travelers in addition we are seeing significant crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during 2018 more than one in three expedia group transactions globally were booked on a mobile device 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model in addition our homeaway business facilitates vacation rental bookings earning per transaction commissions traveler service fees or a combination and provides subscriptionbased and other ancillary services to property owners and managers 

under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms alternative accommodations airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings the majority of our merchant transactions relate to hotel bookings under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia group in advance under our merchant contract expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect growth in our etp contracts has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs and as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering we have made adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions based on these dynamics we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through various of our expedia groupbranded and other multiproduct websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers typically select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing and we have started to introduce a shopping cart style feature that incorporates an overall package discount after a traveler selects multiple products the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transactionbased websites

all of our transactionbased brands share and benefit from our ecommerce platform infrastructure including customer support data centers and transaction processing capabilities 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador egypt and india we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have 24hour monitoring and engineering support these data centers have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities additionally we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia group and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia group is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation websites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks copyright domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands domain names and website urls software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us we also protect some inventions and methods by maintaining them as trade secrets either because it provides superior and potentially longertermed protection or because the invention is not patentable but provides us with a competitive advantage 

in connection with our copyrightable content we post and institute procedures under the digital millennium copyright act and similar host privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs text and other 

content uploaded by users however differences between statutes limitations on immunity and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

we are also subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry for example the european union adopted a new regulation in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr requires companies including ours to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data similar laws are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions in addition certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our business

 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities if any of the following risks occur our business andor financial performance could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

industry and operational risks 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional providers of travelrelated services including 

 online and traditional travel agencies  we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies “otas” in many regions such as booking holdings and its subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom as well as regional competitors such as ctrip which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in addition the global ota segment continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships we also compete with traditional travel agencies operating both offline and online wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers travel suppliers may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them many of these competitors such as hotels airlines and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia group sites for instance several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotel search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications some lowcost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and some airlines have attempted to apply or may apply surcharges for bookings made outside their own websites in recent years certain hotel chains have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as favorable rates increased or exclusive product availability complimentary wifi and their own bonus miles or loyalty points or in the case of airlines promote hotel supply at their websites which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours consolidation of travel suppliers may tend to exacerbate such negative effects on our businesses 

search engines and large online portal websites  we also face increasing competition from search engines including google to the extent that leading or dominant search engines that have a significant presence in our key market use their leading or dominant positions to disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning shopping or booking capabilities or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites or offer the ability to transact on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching travel products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas for example google has continued to add features and functionality to its flight and hotel metasearch products “google flights” and “hotel ads” which are growing rapidly and has also further integrated its “book on google” reservation functionality into the hotel ads product in addition these search engines continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our brands or brands in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivago compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and larger client bases than we do we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch websites  travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of booking holdings trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia group tripadvisor skyscanner and qunar both are subsidiaries of ctrip aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch websites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise or if ota advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago’s metasearch marketplace trivago’s business and therefore our results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express global business travel gbt as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile and other platform travel applications  the demand for and functionality of smartphones tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

social media websites social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition 

ecommerce and group buying websites traditional consumer ecommerce platforms including amazon and alibaba and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market for example traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites to the extent our travelers uses these websites these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

alternative accommodations  airbnb booking holdings and other providers of alternative accommodations that facilitate the shortterm rental of homes and apartments from owners both provide an alternative to hotel rooms and compete with alternative accommodation properties available through expedia group brands including homeaway and vrbo the continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and alternative accommodations furthermore airbnb and similar websites have added other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional otas 

other participants in the travel industry other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services we offer to our travelers our travel industry affiliates and partners or our corporate clients for example ridesharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate to the extent any of these services gain market share over time it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing 

technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in evolving channels such as metasearch and mobile as well as voice search capabilities and offering new consumer choices including inventory types and transactional models and increasing supplier inventory on our existing platforms if we fail to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments our business could be adversely affected our attempts to adapt our current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives different legal or tax requirements inadequate return on investments difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto our platforms as well as limiting our ability to develop new site features in addition adaptations to our business may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs and increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers in addition these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we rely heavily on internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch websites including kayak tripadvisor and trivago pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes adopt emerging technologies such as voice alter its search algorithms or results which could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit participation in the search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates or those of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent in addition certain metasearch companies have added various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites to the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers including owners and managers of alternative accommodation properties and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers airlines and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous supplier contracts 

no assurances can be given that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services for example average daily rates “adrs” or ticket prices attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example during regional or global recessions domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slow spending on the services we provide and have a negative impact on our revenue growth additionally if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions andor significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the us dollar it can lead to a negative impact on our foreign denominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars 

further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance political instability including the proposed united kingdom withdrawal from the european union brexit bans on travel from certain countries to the united states geopolitical conflicts trade disputes significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and adrs decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 

 such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing   

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base in existing and emerging markets we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including 

 in recent years certain online travel companies and metasearch websites expanded their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also 

pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia group portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio in addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we are subject to paymentsrelated and fraud risks 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity moreover there can be no assurances that the interchange rates or the fees we pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce our revenue thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

in addition credit card networks such as visa mastercard and american express have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include payment card association operating rules the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss under these rules we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use storage and security of card data we assess our compliance with the pci dss rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected for existing and future payment options we offer to both our customers and suppliers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs to us and our suppliers and reduce the ease of use of our payments options 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones tablet computers and inhome assistants and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity in addition for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks 

related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired private companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue has increased from 39 in 2010 to 45 in 2018 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we begin to operate in new markets and countries we must tailor our services business models and functional compliance structures to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences as well as the 

regulatory and tax landscapes of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 

 the china travel market in particular is significant and has grown significantly in recent years prior to may 2015 we conducted our operations in china primarily through our majority ownership interest in elong inc an online travel service provider in china following the sale of our elong ownership stake in may 2015 to a group of chinabased purchasers including to a subsidiary of ctrip international ltd we have conducted our consumer business in china through localized websites and commercial arrangements with local partners including ctrip there can be no guarantee that we will be able to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in china and our failure to do so could significantly impact our ability to grow our overall business 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia partner solutions business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of applicable laws or governmental authorities it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate 

some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers on which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and mark okerstrom our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia group cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr okerstrom or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees for example additional barriers to or restrictions on travel for professional or personal purposes such as those in the united states in early 2017 may cause significant disruption to our businesses or negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis in addition we plan to move our corporate headquarters from bellevue washington to seattle washington in late 2019 which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain certain employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected 

in addition we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

legal and regulatory risks 

our alternative accommodations business is subject to regulatory risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

our alternative accommodations business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments that affect the alternative accommodation industry and the ability of companies like us to list those alternative accommodations online for example some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit or limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or that regulate short term rental platforms’ ability to list alternative accommodations including prohibiting the listing of unlicensed properties other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm rentals in addition many of the laws that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and the alternative accommodation industry which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our alternative accommodations business and results of operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia group’s operations and financial results 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and alternative accommodation licensing and listing requirements the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection licensing and regulations relating to the offer of travel insurance and related products anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security the provision of payment services and privacy as a result regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements unfavorable changes or 

interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities or requirements for licensing 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations antimoney laundering and anticorruption laws across industries us economic sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries including cuba iran north korea syria and nationals and others of those countries ukrainerussia related sanctions as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities we believe that our activities comply with ofac european union united kingdom and other regulatory authorities’ economic sanction and trade regulations as well as antimoney laundering and anticorruption regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and the uk criminal finances act as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands 

we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries or legal proceedings from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with economic sanctions consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia group and the presentation of information to consumers as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  competition and regulatory matters the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us at a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

furthermore our future growth may be limited by antitrust or competition laws for example our business has grown and continues to expand and as a consequence increases in our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of various domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities these taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues this has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities and has also resulted in legislative action including new taxes on services and gross revenue and through other indirect taxes as such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices and incur additional cost to comply any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits andor levied assessments asserting we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy state and local sales or use taxes or other taxes including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple jurisdictions regarding the application of value addedgoods and services tax to our transactions while we believe we comply with applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we facilitate travel reservations tax authorities may conclude we owe additional taxes and issue tax assessments 

we have in the past been required and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity which payments may be substantial this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest a description of recent significant “paytoplay” payments and refunds as well as ongoing tax inquiries or audits in other “paytoplay” jurisdictions is included in note 16 — commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges including the amount of or basis for such charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes for example the irs notified us of a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in connection with the examination of the 20092010 tax years and although we disagree with the irs’ position and are challenging the adjustments the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results we believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

brexit may create additional indirect tax implications for our business there is uncertainty as to the manner and timing of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and the operation and application of relevant tax laws in the context of the withdrawal agreement scenarios depending upon the outcome we may have a material and adverse impact to our business 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

many of the underlying laws rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the digital economy certain jurisdictions have enacted new tax laws rules and regulations directed at the digital economy and multinational businesses if existing tax laws rules or regulations are amended or if new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations are enacted including with respect to occupancy sales valueadded taxes digital services tax withholding taxes revenue based taxes unclaimed property or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy or multinational businesses the results of these changes could increase our tax liabilities possible outcomes include double taxation multiple levels of taxation or additional obligations prospectively or retrospectively and subject us to interest and penalties demand for our products and services could decrease if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions the outcome of these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

some jurisdictions have enacted laws that require online digital platforms to report user activity or collect and remit taxes from some or all of the travel suppliers listing on the online platform we periodically receive requests from tax authorities for information regarding accommodation providers listing on some of our sites as well as traveler information along with details of certain transactions through our sites and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data the cost of complying with these new rules and information requests may harm our business 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in several jurisdictions for example the tax act reformed us corporate income taxes and among other things reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 but imposed baseerosion prevention measures as well as a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings our estimates of the financial impact of the tax act may change as we review our analysis and as additional guidance becomes available in general changes in tax laws may affect our tax rate increase our tax liabilities carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities 

in october 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to “base erosion and profit shifting” “beps” by multinational companies multiple member jurisdictions including countries in which we operate have implemented recommended changes such as country by country 

reporting “cbcr” the cbcr standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies the cbcr disclosure is expected to result in increased global tax audit activity 

in march 2018 the oecd proposed measures to address the application of corporate tax to companies operating in the digital economy following the oecd’s announcement the european commission published proposals for european union “eu” member states to introduce a new digital services tax on the revenue of companies that provide certain digital services several territories both within and outside the eu including geographies in which we operate have proposed similar measures to introduce new digital services taxes on companies at present there is limited guidance as to the applicability of these taxes to our business these taxes are likely to be incremental to the taxes currently incurred by the company and could result in taxation of the same revenue in multiple countries if enacted these proposed measures could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

 additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years including but not limited to increased disclosure of company activities and the introduction of other new taxes specifically targeting the digital economy certain countries have adopted or have proposed the adoption of unilateral changes thus increasing the risk of double taxation or multiple layers of taxation without relief any changes to us or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of our revenue or earnings and adversely affect our profitability our tax liabilities in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of revenue and earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with as appropriate relevant governmental authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws rules and regulations however due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay our financial condition and results of operations generally 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions has been and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and the outcomes of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites and mobile applications rely on content brands domain names and technology much of which is proprietary we establish and protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark domain name copyright trade secret and patent laws in the us and other jurisdictions license and confidentiality agreements and internal policies and procedures in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information and intellectual property even with these precautions however it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark domain name copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all 

technology information protection and privacy risks 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings cloud computing the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes including new devices services and home assistants such as amazon’s echo and alexa voice and google home and developing technologies such as machine learning artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technologies have and will continue to require new and costly investments transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers for example we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services 

in addition we may not be successful or may be less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as a service provider could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner 

we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site features in addition during the migration process the sites have in the past and may continue in the future to experience reduced functionality decreases in conversion rates and increased costs relating to maintaining redundant systems also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems or enhancements to existing infrastructure technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on information technology systems including the internet and thirdparty hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities and to transmit and store data including booking transactions intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and invoicing information and the collection of payments accounting procurement and supply chain activities in addition we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including through spyware viruses phishing denial of service and similar attacks by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent in addition as we continue to integrate legacy systems from our acquired companies such as orbitz and homeaway into our information technology systems we increase the risk of these system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon  including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers  and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process 

transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our customers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business we devote significant resources to network security monitoring and testing employee training and other security measures but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information intellectual property proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in our operations we may need to expend additional significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and a security breach resulting in the reduction of website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently are often not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to our contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users and our business partners to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands our failure to quickly respond to or adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for our own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

in addition no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time in addition any remediation efforts may be costly for which we may not have adequate insurance to cover such losses or costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

we process store and use customer and employee personal financial and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use theft or destruction 

we process store and use customer and employee personal financial and other data obtained from users of our websites and mobile applications and from our administrative functions there are numerous laws regarding the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal financial and other data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies 

any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use theft or destruction of such data may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans in addition such an event could result in violations of applicable us and international laws governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation such events could also subject us to bank fines penalties or increased transaction costs damage our reputation and brands impair our relationships with current and potential business partners and key service providers all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to privacy regulations and compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for 

the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online four us states including california passed comprehensive privacy legislation that will go into effect in beginning in 2019 or 2020 and 15 additional states are considering privacy legislation this legislative term in addition the european union’s newly adopted privacy and data security regulation the general data protection regulation or gdpr that went into effect in may 2018 requires companies to implement and remain compliant with regulations regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves at least 12 additional countries in asia eastern europe and latin america have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to comply with the gdpr and other privacy laws and regulations failure to meet any of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or legal liability adverse publicity andor damage to our reputation which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

financial and market risks 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in accomodation revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope and complexity of our foreign exchange risk management we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 



 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see growth in both our merchant expedia collect and our agency hotel collect hotel products to the extent our merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline it would likely result in pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have outstanding longterm indebtedness excluding current maturities with a face value of 37 billion and we have a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility risks relating to our indebtedness include 



the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2018 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 17 billion   primarily in bank of america the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj bnp paribas hsbc jpmorgan chase lloyds bank plc standard chartered bank and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation and held term deposits of approximately 566 million at financial institutions including hsbc national australia bank and the bank of nova scotia additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 134 million primarily in bnp paribas and deutsche bank and held term deposits of approximately 86 million at deutsche bank as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2018 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 28 billion the fair value of which was an asset of approximately 22 million the counterparties to these contracts were primarily australia and new zealand banking group barclays bank bank of america the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj mizuho bank citibank goldman sachs hsbc royal bank of canada standard chartered bank societe generale and wells fargo we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts in addition we face significant credit risk and potential payment delays with respect to nonfinancial contract counterparties including our expedia partner solutions partners which may be exacerbated by economic downturns the realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

governance risks 

mr diller currently effectively controls expedia group if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty expedia holdings inc may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia group stock held by liberty expedia holdings which proxy has been assigned by mr diller to liberty expedia holdings until the earlier of may 4 2019 or the occurrence of certain termination events by virtue of the agreements between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings and their respective holdings in expedia group the voting power of an irrevocable proxy granted to mr diller by john c malone and leslie malone over their shares in liberty expedia holdings and the governance arrangements at liberty expedia holdings during the period the assignment of the diller proxy and the proxy granted him by the malones are in effect mr diller is effectively able to control the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia group the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia group at such time liberty expedia holdings could effectively control the voting 

power of our capital stock as a result of their agreements and respective holdings in expedia group mr diller and liberty expedia holdings may be deemed to share voting power over securities representing approximately 55 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia group capital stock as of december 31 2018 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty expedia holdings inc and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty expedia holdings generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty expedia holdings will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s and liberty expedia holdings’ ownership interests and voting power the agreements between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings and between mr diller and the malones and the governance structure at liberty expedia holdings mr diller is currently in a position to control or influence and liberty expedia holdings is in a position to influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets as a result of liberty expedia holdings’ ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia group in the future liberty expedia holdings may be in a position to control or influence such corporate actions this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia group management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iacinteractivecorp or iac and mr kaufman serves as a member of the expedia group board of directors and as a member of the iac board of directors and as executive vice chairman of iac ms clinton and mr von furstenberg also serve as members of the board of directors of both expedia group and iac these overlapping relationships could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for the directors or officers when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia group mr diller in particular may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia group who is also an officer or director of iac be liable to expedia group or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia group because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia group

competition and consumer matters 

over the last several years the online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities “ncas” particularly in europe expedia group companies are or have been involved in investigations predominately related to whether certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia group entities and accommodation providers sometimes also referred to as “most favored nation” or “mfn” provisions are anticompetitive 

in europe investigations or inquiries into contractual parity provisions between hotels and online travel companies including expedia group companies were initiated in 2012 2013 and 2014 by ncas in austria belgium czech republic denmark france germany greece hungary ireland italy poland sweden and switzerland while the ultimate outcome of some of these investigations or inquiries remains uncertain and the expedia group companies’ circumstances are distinguishable from other online travel companies subject to similar investigations and inquiries we note in this context that on april 21 2015 the french italian and swedish ncas working in close cooperation with the european commission announced that they had accepted formal commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve and close the investigations against bookingcom in france italy and sweden by bookingcom removing andor modifying certain rate conditions and availability parity provisions in its contracts with accommodation providers in france italy and sweden as of july 1 2015 among other commitments bookingcom voluntarily extended the geographic scope of these commitments to accommodation providers throughout europe as of the same date 

with effect from august 1 2015 expedia group companies waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in agreements with european hotel partners for a period of five years while the expedia group companies maintain that their parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law these waivers were nevertheless implemented as a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis following the implementation of the expedia group companies waivers nearly all ncas in europe have announced either the closure of their investigation or inquiries involving expedia group companies or a decision not to open an investigation or inquiry involving expedia group companies below are descriptions of additional rate parityrelated matters of note in europe 

the german federal cartel office “fco” has required another online travel company hotel reservation service “hrs” to remove certain clauses from its contracts with hotels hrs’ appeal of this decision was rejected by the higher regional court düsseldorf on january 9 2015 on december 23 2015 the fco announced that it had also required bookingcom by way of an infringement decision to remove certain clauses from its contracts with german hotels bookingcom has appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the higher regional court düsseldorf on february 8 2017 those proceedings remain ongoing

on november 6 2015 the swiss competition authority announced that it had issued a final decision finding certain parity terms existing in previous versions of agreements between swiss hotels and each of certain expedia group companies bookingcom and hrs to be prohibited under swiss law the decision explicitly notes that the expedia group companies current contract terms with swiss hotels are not subject to this prohibition the swiss competition authority imposed no fines or other sanctions against the expedia group companies and did not find an abuse of a dominant market position by the expedia group companies the fco’s case against the expedia group companies’ contractual parity provisions with accommodation providers in germany remains open but is still at a preliminary stage with no formal allegations of wrongdoing having been communicated to the expedia group companies to date

a working group of 10 european ncas belgium czech republic denmark france hungary ireland italy netherlands sweden and the united kingdom and the european commission has been established by the european competition network “ecn” at the end of 2015 to monitor the functioning of the online hotel booking sector following amendments made by a number of online travel companies including bookingcom and expedia group companies in relation to certain parity provisions in their contracts with hotels the working group issued questionnaires to online travel agencies including expedia group companies metasearch sites and hotels in 2016 the underlying results of the ecn monitoring exercise were published on april 6 2017 

legislative bodies in france july 2015 austria december 2016 and italy august 2017 have also adopted new domestic antiparity clause legislation expedia group believes each of these pieces of legislation violates both eu and national legal principles and therefore expedia group companies have challenged these laws at the european commission moreover in belgium new domestic antiparity legislation entered into force on august 20 2018 a motion requesting the swiss government to take action on narrow price parity has been adopted in the swiss parliament the swiss government is now required to draft legislation implementing the motion the company is unable to predict whether and with what content legislation will ultimately be adopted and if so when this might be the case it is not yet clear how any adopted domestic antiparity clause legislations andor any possible future legislation in this area may affect expedia groups business 

outside of europe a number of ncas have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including expedia group companies a brazilian hotel sector association  forum de operadores hoteleiros do brasil  filed a complaint with the brazilian administrative council for economic defence “cade” against a number of online travel companies including bookingcom decolarcom and expedia group companies on july 27 2016 with respect to parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies on september 13 2016 the expedia group companies submitted a response to the complaint to cade on march 27 2018 the expedia group companies resolved cade’s concerns based on a settlement implementing waivers substantially similar to those provided to accommodation providers in europe in late 2016 expedia group companies resolved the concerns of the australia and new zealand ncas based on implementation of the waivers substantially similar to those provided to accommodation providers in europe on september 1 2016 in australia and on october 28 2016 in new zealand more recently however the australian nca has reopened its investigation expedia group companies are in ongoing discussions with a limited number of ncas in other countries in relation to their contracts with hotels expedia group is currently unable to predict the impact the implementation of the waivers both in europe and elsewhere will have on expedia groups business on investigations or inquiries by ncas in other countries or on industry practice more generally 

in addition regulatory authorities in europe including the uk competition and markets authority or “cma” australia and elsewhere have initiated legal proceedings andor undertaken market studies inquiries or investigations relating to online marketplaces and how information is presented to consumers using those marketplaces including practices such as search results rankings and algorithms discount claims  disclosure of charges and availability and similar messaging 

on june 28 2018 the cma announced that it will be requiring hotel booking websites to take action to address concerns identified in the course of its ongoing investigation after consulting with the cma on january 31 2019 we agreed to offer certain voluntary undertakings with respect to the presentation of information on certain of our uk consumerfacing websites in order to address the cma’s concerns the cma has confirmed that as a result of the undertakings offered it will close its investigation without any admission or finding of liability the undertakings become effective on september 1 2019 on august 23 2018 the australian competition and consumer commission or accc instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law relating to trivago’s advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s australian site and trivago’s strikethrough pricing practice a trial date is set for september 9 2019 and an appropriate reserve has been accrued in respect of this matter 

we are cooperating with regulators in the investigations described above where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect such actions will have on our business industry practices or online commerce more generally other than described above we have not accrued a reserve in connection with the market studies investigations inquiries or legal proceedings described above either because the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of any loss is not estimable

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2017 and 2018 represented years of continuing growth for the travel industry however political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues natural disasters and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future for additional information about our growth strategy for expedia group see the disclosure set forth in part i item 1 business under the caption “growth strategy” 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet are driving rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2019 over 45 of us and european leisure and unmanaged corporate travel expenditures are expected to occur online online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of the united states and europe and are estimated to be in the range of 35 to 45 in 2019 these penetration rates increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business while also attracting many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom owned by booking holdings trivago in which expedia group owns a majority interest as well as tripadvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools in addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry businesses such as airbnb homeaway which expedia acquired in december 2015 and bookingcom owned by booking holdings have emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market many other competitors including vacation rental metasearch players continue to emerge in this space which is expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market furthermore we see increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations including direct booking functionality and product enhancements by companies such as google finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their websites for additional detail regarding the competitive trends and risks we face see part i item 1 business  competition and part i item 1a risk factors  we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment” 

the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia group distributes both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings for our hotel supply partners through both agencyonly contracts as well as our hybrid etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis making decisions in each applicable market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity and the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in 

emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive in addition the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing traveler mind share for more detail see part i item 1a risk factors  we rely on the value of our brands and the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing” and “our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally” 

lodging 

lodging includes hotel accommodations as well as alternative accommodations primarily made available through homeaway as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2018 lodging accounted for 69 our room night growth has been healthy with room nights 32 in 2016 excluding elong 16 in 2017 and 13 in 2018 adrs for rooms booked on expedia and homeaway websites increased 5 in 2016 excluding elong due to the acquisition of homeaway 3 in 2017 and 5 in 2018 

hotel we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states remain high however us hotel supply has continued to grow which may put additional pressure on adrs in some international markets hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions companies like airbnb homeaway and bookingcom also added incremental global supply in the alternative accommodations space in addition while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups in the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on thirdparty websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi we have succeeded in adding supply to our global lodging marketplace with more than one million properties on our global websites as of december 31 2018 including more than 370000 integrated homeaway vacation rental listings 

alternative accommodations   with our acquisition of homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we expanded into the fast growing alternative accommodations market homeaway is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group homeaway has been undergoing a transition from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology homeaway offers hosts subscriptionbased listing or payperbooking service models it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings as of december 31 2018 there are over 18 million online bookable listings available on homeaway with over 370000 listings also available through expedia groups other brands 

air 

significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the us air carriers further strengthening their position however in 2017 and into 2018 there was evidence of discounting by the us carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results starting in the second half of 2018 there has been evidence of modest fare increases though it remains unclear if this trend will continue ticket prices on expedia group websites declined 6 in 2016 excluding elong 1 in 2017 and increased 2 in 2018 based on airline reports demand for airline tickets seems to be strong helping increase air revenues globally there is significant correlation between airline revenues and fuel prices and fluctuations in fuel prices generally take time to be reflected in air revenues given current volatility it is uncertain whether the recent increases in fuel prices will drive further increases in airfares particularly when considering planned supply increases through capacity additions we can encounter 

pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine and as certain supply agreements renew and continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets 

air ticket volumes increased 32 in 2016 excluding elong primarily due to the acquisition of orbitz 4 in 2017 and 5 in 2018 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2018 air accounted for 8 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch website in addition to expedia group media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2018 we generated a total of 11 billion of advertising and media revenue a slight increase from 2017 representing 10 of our total worldwide revenue in 2018 trivago shifted its operational focus reducing marketing spend to better balance revenue and profit growth the lower marketing spend negatively impacted revenue growth while benefiting profitability we expect that trend to continue in the first half of 2019 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel services including merchant and agency hotel is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our vacation rental business historically homeaway has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago have typically been experienced in the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we typically increase marketing during the busy booking period for spring summer and winter holiday travel as a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix including the growth of homeaway may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in shortterm impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends as homeaway has further shifted to a predominately transactionbased business model for vacation rental listings and its booking window elongates its seasonal trends are more pronounced than our other traditional leisure businesses 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

deferred loyalty rewards 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom rewards program our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on over 30 brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points net of expected breakage as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors including fluctuations in reward value product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior 

business combinations 

we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and if applicable record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

the tax act was enacted in december 2017 and the tax act significantly changed us tax law by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax act reduced the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date we applied the guidance in sab 118 when accounting for the enactment date effects of the tax act in 2017 and throughout 2018 at 

december 31 2017 we had not completed our accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the tax act under accounting standards codification 740 income taxes for the following aspects onetime transition tax and revaluation of deferred tax balances as of december 31 2018 we have now completed our accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the tax act based on our final analysis changes in our estimates during 2018 relating to the onetime transition tax and revaluation of deferred tax balances were immaterial the tax act created a new requirement that global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” earned by our foreign subsidiaries must be included in gross us taxable income which we account for in the period incurred the period cost method 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy and other taxes  some states and localities impose taxes eg transient occupancy accommodation tax sales tax andor business privilege tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit taxes nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes more recently a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against homeaway for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of vacation rental properties or for taxes on homeaway’s services homeaway is an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting a vacation property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 10000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy and other taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

historically our primary form of employee stockbased compensation was stock option awards our employee stock options consist of service based awards some of which also have marketbased vesting conditions we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques including the blackscholes and monte carlo optionpricing models for awards that contain marketbased vesting conditions we amortize the fair value over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of servicebased awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straightline basis we account for forfeitures as they occur the 

pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

in addition we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in 15 lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 46 million  as of december 31 2018  and 43 million  as of december 31 2017  

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york new jersey north carolina minnesota oregon rhode island maryland pennsylvania hawaii iowa massachusetts the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel occupancy andor car rental we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including to the states of new york new jersey south carolina north carolina minnesota georgia wyoming oregon rhode island montana maryland kentucky maine new jersey pennsylvania hawaii iowa massachusetts the city of new york and the district of columbia as well as certain other jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity for additional information including significant paytoplay payments made by expedia group companies as well as reimbursement of certain paytoplay amounts received by expedia group companies see note 16 — commitments and contingencies   legal proceedings  paytoplay in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other jurisdictions we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities some of which including in the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes and in the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax “vat” to our european union related transactions may impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

segments 

we have four reportable segments core ota trivago homeaway and egencia our core ota segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world orbitz cheaptickets ebookers expedia partner solutions hotwirecom travelocity wotif group carrentalscom classic vacations and silverrail technologies inc our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites our homeaway segment operates an online marketplace for the alternative accommodations industry our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions as well as homeaway bookings recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

when homeaway properties are booked through our core ota websites and vice versa the segments split the thirdparty revenue for management and segment reporting purposes with the majority of the thirdparty revenue residing with the website marketing the property or room the operating metrics including gross bookings and room nights are not split but instead generally reside entirely with the website marketing the property or room 

gross bookings and revenue margin 



 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2018  and 2017  compared to the prior year periods was primarily due to growth in the core ota segment including growth at brand expedia hotelscom and expedia partner solutions as well as growth at homeaway

adjusted ebitda by segment 

 

1 adjusted ebitda is a nongaap measure see definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda below for more information 

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric see note 18 — segment information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income loss attributable to expedia group inc for the periods presented above 

core ota adjusted ebitda increased 248 million  during 2018  primarily due to an increase in revenue combined with a decrease in selling and marketing as a percentage of revenue in the current period adjusted ebitda increased 101 million  during 2017  primarily due to an increase of 797 million  in revenue partially offset by an increase in online marketing expense mostly at brand expedia expedia partner solutions and hotelscom and including an increase in online spend at trivago 

trivago adjusted ebitda increased 11 million  during 2018  beginning late in the second quarter of 2018 trivago started focusing on improved profitability and made significant reductions in its advertising spend as a result of this increased focus on reducing operating expenditures trivago adjusted ebitda declined 30 million  during 2017 the deterioration was largely driven by a sudden change in advertiser bidding at the end of the second quarter of 2017 resulting in a sharp decline in revenue growth marketing spend in particular precommitted television spend could not be adjusted to an optimal level timely enough and resulted in the declining profitability 

homeaway adjusted ebitda increased 86 million  during 2018  due to an increase of 265 million  in revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses from planned investments in performancebased marketing as well as continued investing in both customer and supplier facing products and homeaways migration to the cloud homeaway adjusted ebitda increased 27 million  during 2017  due to an increase of 217 million  in revenue partially offset by higher selling and marketing and technology and content expense during 2017 homeaway continued to invest in offline and online brand marketing to bring more demand to its supply base and in growing its product and technology teams 

egencia adjusted ebitda increased 12 million  during 2018  primarily due to an increase in revenue of 80 million  as a result of adding new corporate clients and room night growth partially offset by investments in customer service and product to 

further differentiate egencia egencia adjusted ebitda increased 14 million  in 2017  primarily due to an increase in revenue of 59 million  as a result of adding new corporate clients and room night growth as well as scale efficiencies partially offset by investments in sales product and technology 

unallocated overhead costs increased 100 million  during 2018  primarily due to higher general and administrative personnel and overhead costs as well as higher technology and content expense to support investments in our ecommerce platform unallocated overhead costs increased 15 million  during 2017  primarily due to higher general and administrative professional fees as well as personnel and overhead costs partially offset by lower technology and content expense as we lapped over an accelerated pace of technology hiring in 2016 

interest income and expense 



interest income increased in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to interest income recognized on the san francisco paytoplay refund mentioned above of 19 million as well as higher invested balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return interest income increased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher invested balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return 

interest expense increased in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily as a full year of interest on the 1 billion senior unsecured notes issued in september 2017 partially offset by lower interest expense due to the august 2018 maturity of our 500 million senior unsecured notes interest expense increased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily as a result of additional interest on the 1 billion senior unsecured notes issued in september 2017 

as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our senior unsecured notes indebtedness totaled 37 billion  42 billion  and 32 billion respectively 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 



during 2018 the losses on minority equity investments net related to fair value changes in our investment in despegar a publicly traded company partially offset by 33 million of gains related to minority investments without readily determinable fair values for which recently observable and orderly transactions for similar investments occurred during the year see note 2 — significant accounting policies  – recently adopted accounting policies – recognition and measurement of financial instruments for more information on the related new accounting guidance for minority equity investments adopted in 2018 

provision for income taxes   

our effective tax rate for 2018  was lower than the 21 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower as well as 

excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments and foreignderived intangible income fdii the net increase in our effective rate for 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily driven by the tax act the 2018 nondeductible goodwill impairments as discussed in note 4 — fair value measurements  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and a decrease in the excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments   

our effective tax rate for 2017  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states well as excess tax benefits related to stockbased payments the net increase in our effective rate for 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to onetime tax benefits in 2016 including release of a valuation allowance and return to provision trueups as well as an increase in losses generated in foreign jurisdictions at tax rates below the 35 federal statutory rate the effects of the provisional income inclusion for the deemed repatriation transition tax pursuant to the tax act were negated by the benefit of the provisional remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability   

our effective tax rate for 2016  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states as well as the tax benefits from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stockbased compensation and the release of valuation allowances in the united kingdom and germany on cumulative foreign net operating losses for which it is more likely than not the tax benefit will be realized 

for additional information including additional information on the impacts of the tax act see note 10 — income taxes   in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters which may ultimately be settled in cash and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above in the legal proceedings section as well as the notes to the financial statements the nongaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to expedia group inc adjusted for 1 net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 provision for income taxes 3 total other expenses net 4 stockbased compensation expense including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans 5 acquisitionrelated impacts including i amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment ii gains losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements if any and iii upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree if any 6 certain other items including restructuring 7 items included in legal reserves occupancy tax and other 8 that portion of gains losses on revenue hedging activities that are included in other net that relate to revenue recognized in the period and 9 depreciation 

the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future ongoing performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments in addition we believe that by excluding certain items such as stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated impacts adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 

the reconciliation of net income attributable to expedia group inc to adjusted ebitda is as follows 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 25 billion  and 33 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  and our 2 billion revolving credit facility which is essentially untapped and expires in may 2023 

as of december 31 2018  the total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 12 billion 10 billion in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries and 220 million in majorityowned subsidiaries the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the united states and for which future distributions could be taxable was 104 million  as of december 31 2018 the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the us federal income tax consequences of these earnings was 22 million  as of december 31 2018 

the revolving credit facility which was amended in 2018 to increase the borrowing capacity to 2 billion extend the expiration to may 2023 and reduce the interest rate on loans under the facility as disclosed herein bears interest based on the company’s credit ratings with the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts at libor plus 125  basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 175 basis points as of december 31 2018 the facility contains various restrictive covenants including a maximum permissible leverage ratio and a minimum permissible interest coverage ratio as of december 31 2018  the maximum permissible leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage were 400 to 100 and 275 to 100 respectively 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2018  moody’s rating was ba1 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt which was comprised of 750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 595 the “595 notes” 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 45 the “45 notes” euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 25 the 25 notes 750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 50 the 50 notes and the 1 billion of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2028 that bear interest at 38 the 38 

notes in august 2018 our 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes that bore interest at 7456 matured and the balance was repaid 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel advertising or certain expedia partner solutions relationships or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers such as with mobile bookings via smartphones our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by homeaways continued shift to become the merchant of record on more of its transactions 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp as well as the transformation of the homeaway vacation rental listing business may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2018  we had a deficit in our working capital of 29 billion  compared to a deficit of 23 billion  as of december 31 2017  the change in the deficit was primarily due to investing and financing activities including capital expenditures and purchase of treasury stock partially offset by operating cash flows 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements in infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts in addition in 2016 we began our expansion into the cloud computing environment while our cloud computing expenses have increased and are expected to continue to increase significantly over the next few years they are expected to result in lower overall capital expenditures related to our data centers over time our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt excluding capital expenditures associated with the build out of our new corporate headquarters we expect total capital expenditures for full year 2019 to increase over 2018 spending levels for the new headquarters we expect to spend approximately 900 million of the total approximately 30 million was spent in 2016 approximately 70 million in 2017 and approximately 190 million in 2018 during 2019 and 2020 we expect to spend 425 to 475 million and 135 to 185 million respectively however the timing of spend could shift as we progress toward completion of the project and total spend estimates could increase due to impacts from any additional tariffs 

our cash flows are as follows 



in 2018  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 130 million  primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for impacts of depreciation amortization and impairments and a refund of paytoplay hotel occupancy tax amounts partially offset by a decrease in benefits from working capital changes including lower merchant liability benefits 

and higher cash paid for taxes in 2017  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 296 million  primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes driven mostly from a change in merchant liabilities 

in 2018  1022 million  less cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net sales of investments of 334 million in the current year compared to net purchases of investments of 715 million in the prior year and higher cash used for acquisitions in 2017 partially offset by higher current year capital expenditures primarily related to our new corporate headquarters in 2017  cash used in investing activities increased by 863 million  due to net purchase of investments of 715 million in 2017 compared to cash provided by net sales of investments of 16 million in 2016 and an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 168 million in 2017 these increases were partially offset by 6 million cash inflow in the 2017 due to the net settlement of foreign currency forwards compared to 53 million cash outflow in 2016 as well as lower capital expenditures of 39 million in 2017 

cash used in financing activities in 2018  primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 923 million  including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below the 500 million longterm debt repayment and a 186 million  cash dividend payment partially offset by 166 million  of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans cash provided by financing activities in 2017  primarily included 990 million  of net proceeds from the issuance of 38 notes as well as 229 million  of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 312 million  and a 176 million  cash dividend payment cash used in financing activities in 2016 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 456 million the repayment of 401 million of homeaway convertible notes and 150 million cash dividend payment partially offset by 215 million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of trivago as well as 141 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans 

during 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million  outstanding shares of our common stock during each of the respective years during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million  shares of our common stock and during 2018 authorized a repurchase of up to 15 million  shares of our common stock for a total of 85 million  shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 



   

 as of december 31 2018  122 million  shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2018 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases 

our common stock dividend was 124  per share for 2018  116  per share for 2017  and 100  per share for 2016  see note 12 — stockholders’ equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition in february 2019  the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of  032  per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 27 2019  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 7 2019  future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a reduction of our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2018  of 139 million  reflecting net depreciations in foreign currencies during 2018  foreign exchange rate changes resulted in increases in our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2017  of 147 million  reflecting net appreciations in foreign currencies during 2017 foreign exchange rate changes resulted in reduction in our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2016 of 35 million  reflecting net depreciations in foreign currencies during 2016 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

interest rate risk 

in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 in september 2017 we issued 1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 38 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 595 notes 25 notes 45 notes 50 notes and 38 notes were approximately 778 million  771 million  504 million  760 million  and 915 million  as of december 31 2018  as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 595 notes by approximately 6 million our 25 notes by approximately 12 million our 45 notes by approximately 12 million our 50 notes by approximately 22 million and our 38 notes by approximately 35 million 

we maintain a 2 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  or 2016  

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had a net forward asset of 22 million  and 6 million  included in prepaid expenses and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 23 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2018  as the net composition of these balances fluctuate 

frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2018  2017  and 2016  we recorded net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 3 million   38 million  loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 46 million   40 million  loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 15 million   30 million  loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our websites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space for more than two decades each expedia technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options we have made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace improvements in our global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia continue to enable us to increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands in 2013 expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded websites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas during 2014 the travelocitybranded websites were successfully migrated to the expedia technology platform in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently converted the wotifcom website to the expedia technology platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated in september 2015 expedia acquired orbitz worldwide including all of its brands the orbitz cheaptickets and ebookers websites were migrated to the expedia technology platform in the first half of 2016 and orbitz for business customers were migrated to the egencia technology platform by july 2016 in december 2015 expedia acquired homeaway inc including all of its brands additionally in june 2017 expedia acquired a majority stake in silverrail a leading rail technology distributor we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

channel expansion  technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends and some of our brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional pcs mobile bookings continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods additionally our brands implemented new technologies like voicebased search chatbots and messaging apps as mobilebased options for travelers in addition we are seeing significant crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during 2017 approximately one in three expedia inc transactions were booked globally on a mobile device 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model in addition upon our acquisition of homeaway in december 2015 we also earn revenue related to subscriptionbased vacation rental listing and other ancillary services provided to property owners and managers as well as from the traveler service fee that was rolled out in the united states and europe in the first half of 2016 

under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings the majority of our merchant transactions relate to hotel bookings under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing 

reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia in advance under our merchant contract expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect growth in our etp contracts has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs and as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering we have made adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions based on these dynamics we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through various of our expediabranded and other multiproduct websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages for a specified period at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers typically select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing and we have started to introduce a shopping cart style feature that incorporates an overall package discount after a traveler selects multiple products the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other pricing models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transactionbased websites 

with our acquisition of homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we expanded into the fast growing 100 billion alternative accommodations market homeaway is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia homeaway has been undergoing a transition from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology in addition homeaway rolled out a traveler service fee in the united states and europe during the first half of 2016 consistent with market practice the fee is expected to continue to contribute to homeaway’s revenue growth and help fund marketing investments programs to better protect travelers and future growth initiatives furthermore homeaway moved to a single subscription option globally in july 2016

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers to our websites 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media websites offline advertising loyalty programs mobile apps and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include hotelscom rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia ®  rewards on over 30 brand expedia points of sale as well as orbitz rewards on orbitzcom the cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the brand expedia hotelscom hotwire travelocity orbitz cheaptickets homeaway wotif and lastminutecomau branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia hotelscom or homeaway cobranded offering or a private label website our ean business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites

we operate several technology platforms that support our brands the brand expedia technology platform supports our fullservice and multiproduct brands including brand expedia orbitz travelocity wotif group cheaptickets ebookers and expedia local expert as well as certain parts of the hotwire brand the hotelscom technology platform supports our hotelonly offering including hotelscom and ean in addition we operate egencia our corporate travel platform homeaway our vacation rentals platform and trivago the metasearch platform 

all of our transactionbased brands share and benefit from our ecommerce platform infrastructure including customer support data centers and transaction processing capabilities 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador egypt and india we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have 24hour monitoring and engineering support these data centers have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities additionally we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation websites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks copyright domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands domain names and website urls software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registration and by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with national trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect inventions as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

in connection with our copyrightable content we post and institute procedures under the digital millennium copyright act and similar host privilege statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs text and other content uploaded by users however differences between statutes limitations on immunity and moderation efforts may affect our ability to claim immunity 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

we are also subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry for example the european union adopted a new regulation that will become effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr will require companies including ours to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our business

 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities if any of the following risks occur our business andor financial performance could be materially adversely affected additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including 

 online and traditional travel agencies  we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies “otas” in many regions such as the priceline group and its subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom as well as regional competitors such as ctrip which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in addition the global ota segment continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships we also compete with traditional travel agencies operating both offline and online wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers  travel suppliers may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them many of these competitors such as airlines hotels and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotel search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications and some lowcost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites in recent years certain hotel chains have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as favorable rates increased or exclusive product availability complimentary wifi and their own bonus miles or loyalty points or in the case of airlines promote hotel supply at their websites which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

search engines and large online portal websites  we also face increasing competition from search engines including google to the extent that leading search engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning shopping or booking capabilities or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites or offer the ability to transact on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas for example google has entered various aspects of the online travel market including by establishing a flight metasearch product “google flights” and a hotel metasearch product “hotel ads” that are growing rapidly as well as its “book on google” reservation functionality in addition these search engines continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence 

capabilities to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our websites or websites in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivagobranded websites compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and larger client bases than we do we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch websites  travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of priceline trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia tripadvisor skyscanner and qunar both are subsidiaries of ctrip aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch websites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise or if ota advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago’s metasearch marketplace trivago’s business and therefore our results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express global business travel gbt as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile and other platform travel applications  the demand for and functionality of smartphones tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and mobileresponsive websites are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

social media websites social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition notably facebook has launched dynamic ads for travel product expanding its reach into the travel market 

ecommerce and group buying websites traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market for example traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites to the extent our travelers uses these websites these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

alternative accommodations  airbnb and similar websites that facilitate the shortterm rental of homes and apartments from owners provide an alternative to hotel rooms and vacation rental properties available through expedia websites including homeaway the continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and vacation rentals furthermore airbnb and similar websites have added other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional otas 

other participants in the travel industry other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services we offer to our travelers our travel industry affiliates and partners or our corporate clients for example ridesharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate to the extent any of these services gain market share over time it may create additional competition and could negatively affect our businesses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in evolving channels such as metasearch and mobile as well as voice search capabilities and offering new consumer choices including inventory types and transactional models and increasing supplier inventory on our existing platforms through acquisitions and partnerships if we fail to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments our business could be adversely affected our attempts to adapt our current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives different legal or tax requirements inadequate return on investments difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto our platforms as well as limiting our ability to develop new site features in addition adaptations to our business may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs and increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers in addition these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch websites including kayak tripadvisor and trivago pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes adopt emerging technologies such as voice alter its search algorithms or results which could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit participation in the search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates or those of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent in addition certain metasearch companies have added various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites to the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers including owners and managers of vacation rental properties and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers airlines and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous supplier contracts 

no assurances can be given that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services for example average daily rates “adrs” or ticket prices attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example during regional or global recessions domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slow spending on the services we provide and have a negative impact on our revenue growth additionally if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions andor significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the us dollar it can lead to a negative impact on our foreign denominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance political instability including the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union bans on travel from certain countries to the united states geopolitical conflicts significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and adrs decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 

 such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing   

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base in existing and emerging markets we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including 



 during 2017 certain online travel companies and metasearch websites continued to expand their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio in addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings cloud computing the continued growth of alternative platforms and mobile computing devices the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes including new devices services and home assistants such as amazon’s echo and alexa voice and google home and developing technologies such as machine learning artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technologies have and will continue to require new and costly investments transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers for example we are in the midst of a multiyear project to migrate products data storage and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of public cloud computing services such as amazon web services in addition we may not be successful or may be less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as a service provider could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site features in addition during the migration process the sites have in the past and may continue in the future to experience reduced functionality decreases in conversion rates and increased costs relating to maintaining redundant systems also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems or enhancements to existing infrastructure technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks 

related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired private companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our homeaway business is subject to regulatory risks and continues its transition to a primarily transactionbased business either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

homeaway has been and continues to be subject to regulatory development that affects the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like us to list those vacation rentals online for example some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or otherwise limit their ability to do so and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm vacation rentals in addition many of the laws that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging 

companies were established before the growth of the internet and the vacation rental industry which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to legal financial and competitive risk associated with homeaway’s transition to a primarily transactionbased business homeaway historically generated the majority of its revenues when owners or managers of vacation rentals paid homeaway subscription fees for the listing of their properties on the homeaway family of websites while subscription fees were previously the predominant source of revenue for homeaway a growing share of homeaway’s revenue is now generated from a commissionbased business model where the traveler pays a service fee for the use of the homeaway platform and the owner or manager of the property pays homeaway a fee or a commission on a transactional basis for each booking of the property by a traveler homeaway launched the traveler service fee and introduced its book with confidence guarantee in the united states beginning in february 2016 followed by a rollout in europe beginning in june 2016 in addition homeaway moved to a single subscription option for its homeowners and property manager partners in july 2016 homeaway’s business model transition involves significant additional risks and potential costs for homeaway including 

 these risks could have a material adverse effect on homeaway’s business and results of operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia’s operations and financial results 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue has increased from 39 in 2010 to 45 in 2017 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we begin to operate in new markets and countries we must tailor our services business models and functional compliance structures to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences as well as the regulatory and tax landscapes of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 



 the china travel market in particular is significant and has grown significantly in recent years prior to may 2015 we conducted our operations in china primarily through our majority ownership interest in elong inc an online travel service provider in china following the sale of our elong ownership stake in may 2015 to a group of chinabased purchasers including to a subsidiary of ctrip international ltd we have conducted our business in china through localized websites and commercial arrangements with local partners including ctrip there can be no guarantee that we will be able to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in china and our failure to do so could significantly impact our ability to grow our overall business 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and vacation rental licensing and listing requirements the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security the provision of payment services and privacy as a result regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations and anticorruption laws across industries us economic sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries including cuba iran north korea sudan syria and the crimea region of the ukraine and nationals and others of those countries as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities we believe that our activities comply with ofac european union united kingdom and other regulatory authorities’ economic sanction and trade regulations and anticorruption regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and the uk criminal finances act as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands 

we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries or legal proceedings from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia and the presentation of information to consumers as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  competition and regulatory matters  the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

furthermore our future growth may be limited by antitrust or competition laws for example our business has grown and continues to expand and as a consequence increases in our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of various domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities these taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues this has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities as such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits andor levied assessments asserting we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy state and local sales or use taxes or other taxes including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple jurisdictions regarding the application of value addedgoods and services tax to our transactions while we believe we comply with applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we facilitate travel reservations tax authorities may conclude we owe additional taxes and issue tax assessments 

we have in the past been required and may in the future be required   in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity which payments may be substantial this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes for example as a precondition to challenging the assessments during 2009 we paid 48 million under protest to the city of san francisco and an additional 255 million under protest on may 26 2014 in connection with additional assessments and during 2013 we paid 171 million to the state of hawaii in september 2015 following a ruling by the hawaii supreme court the state of hawaii refunded the expedia companies 132 million of the original “paytoplay” amount and orbitz also received a similar refund of 22 million on may 15 2017 the expedia companies paid under protest the full amount claimed due or approximately 167 million as a condition of appealing the august 5 2016 decision by the hawaii tax court holding that taxes are due on the online travel companies’ services to facilitate merchant model car rental transactions 

significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges including the amount of or basis for such charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes for example the irs recently notified us of a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in connection with the examination of the 20092010 tax years and although we disagree with the irs’ position and are challenging the adjustments the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results we believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals in which case we may 

be subject to additional tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

while many of the underlying laws rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the digital economy some jurisdictions have enacted new tax laws rules and regulations directed at the digital economy and multinational businesses if existing tax laws rules or regulations are amended or if new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations are enacted particularly with respect to occupancy sales valueadded taxes or unclaimed property or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy or multinational businesses the results could increase our tax payments including the possibility of double taxation or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively subject us to interest and penalties decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions as a result these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in several jurisdictions for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act reforms us corporate income taxes and among other things reduces the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 but imposes baseerosion prevention measures as well as a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings our initial estimates of the financial impact of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act may change as we review our analysis and as additional guidance becomes available in general changes in tax laws may affect our tax rate increase our tax liabilities carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities 

in addition in october 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to “base erosion and profit shifting” “beps” by multinational companies multiple member jurisdictions including countries in which we operate have begun implementing recommended changes such as country by country reporting “cbcr” the cbcr standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies the cbcr disclosure is expected to result in increased global tax audit activity additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years certain countries have adopted unilateral changes increasing the risk of double taxation any changes to us or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and adversely affect our profitability our tax liabilities in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with as appropriate relevant governmental authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws rules and regulations however due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on information technology systems including the internet and thirdparty hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities and to transmit and store data including booking transactions intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and invoicing information and the collection of payments accounting procurement and supply chain activities in addition we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including through spyware viruses phishing denial of service and similar attacks by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent in addition as we continue to integrate legacy systems from our acquired companies such as orbitz and homeaway into our information technology systems we increase the risk of these system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon  including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers  and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our customers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business we devote significant resources to network security monitoring and testing employee training and other security measures but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information intellectual property proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in our operations we may need to expend additional significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and a security breach resulting in the reduction of website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently are often not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to our contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users and our business partners to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands our failure to quickly respond to or adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for our own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

in addition no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time in addition any remediation efforts may be costly for which we may not have adequate insurance to cover such losses or costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

we process store and use customer and employee personal financial and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use theft or destruction 

we process store and use customer and employee personal financial and other data obtained from users of our websites and mobile applications and from our administrative functions there are numerous laws regarding the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal financial and other data the scope of which is changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data 

protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies 

any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use theft or destruction of such data may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand our ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans in addition such an event could result in violations of applicable us and international laws governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation such events could also subject us to bank fines penalties or increased transaction costs damage our reputation and brands impair our relationships with current and potential business partners and key service providers all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to international privacy regulations compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online 

 in addition the european court of justice’s invalidation of the useu safe harbor framework could make it more difficult for us to transfer data outside of the european union for processing and the european union’s reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance for example the european union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in may 2018 called the general data protection regulation which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to meet these requirements could result in significant penalties finally countries in other regions most notably asia eastern europe and latin america are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted 

we are subject to paymentsrelated and fraud risks 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity moreover there can be no assurances that the interchange rates or the fees we pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce our revenue thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

in addition credit card networks such as visa mastercard and american express have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include payment card association operating rules the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss under these rules we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use storage and security of card data we assess our compliance with the pci dss rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones tablet computers and inhome 

assistants and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity in addition for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope and complexity of our foreign exchange risk management we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 



 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see growth in both our merchant expedia collect and our agency hotel collect hotel products to the extent our merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline it would likely result in pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and mark okerstrom our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr okerstrom or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees for example additional barriers to or restricts on travel for professional or personal purposes such as those in the united states in early 2017 may cause significant disruption to our businesses or negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected 

in addition we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

mr diller currently effectively controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty expedia holdings inc may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty expedia holdings which proxy has been assigned by mr diller to liberty expedia holdings until the earlier of may 4 2018 or the occurrence of certain termination events by virtue of the agreements between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings and their respective holdings in expedia the voting power of an irrevocable proxy granted to mr diller by john c malone and leslie malone over their shares in liberty expedia holdings and the governance arrangements at liberty expedia holdings during the period the assignment of the diller proxy and the proxy granted him by the malones are in effect mr diller is effectively able to control the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty expedia holdings could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock as a result of their agreements and respective holdings in expedia mr diller and liberty expedia holdings may be deemed to share voting power over securities representing approximately 54  of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2017 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty expedia holdings inc and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty expedia holdings generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty expedia holdings will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s and liberty expedia holdings’ ownership interests and voting power the agreements between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings and between mr diller and the malones and the governance structure at liberty expedia holdings mr diller is currently in a position to control or influence and liberty expedia holdings is in a position to influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets as a result of liberty expedia holdings’ ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia in the future liberty expedia holdings may be in a position to control or influence such corporate actions this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that mr diller and mr kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia affiliate network business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of applicable laws or governmental authorities it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate 

some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers on which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2017 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 21 billion   primarily in bank of america bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj bnp paribas hsbc and jpmorgan chase and held term deposits of approximately 852 million at financial institutions including bnp paribas jpmorgan chase mizuho bank ltd national australia bank the bank of nova scotia sumitomo mitsui bank and standard chartered bank additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 163 million primarily in deutsche bank hsbc and national australia bank and held term deposits of approximately 169 million at financial institutions including citibank and deutsche bank as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2017 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 26 billion the fair value of which was an asset of approximately 6 million the counterparties to these contracts were barclays bank bnp paribas bank of america the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj citibank credit suisse international goldman sachs hsbc jpmorgan chase mizuho royal bank of canada standard chartered bank the bank of nova scotia societe generale us bank and wells fargo we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts 

in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have outstanding longterm indebtedness excluding current maturities with a face value of 37 billion and we have a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility risks relating to our indebtedness include 

 the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test

competition and consumer matters 

over the last several years the online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities ncas particularly in europe expedia is or has been involved in investigations predominately related to whether certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia entities and accommodation providers sometimes also referred to as most favored nation or mfn provisions are anticompetitive 

in europe investigations or inquiries into contractual parity provisions between hotels and online travel companies including expedia were initiated in 2012 2013 and 2014 by ncas in austria belgium czech republic denmark france germany greece hungary ireland italy poland sweden and switzerland while the ultimate outcome of some of these investigations or inquiries remains uncertain and expedia’s circumstances are distinguishable from other online travel companies subject to similar investigations and inquiries we note in this context that on april 21 2015 the french italian and swedish ncas working in close cooperation with the european commission announced that they had accepted formal commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve and close the investigations against bookingcom in france italy and sweden 

by bookingcom removing andor modifying certain rate conditions and availability parity provisions in its contracts with accommodation providers in france italy and sweden as of july 1 2015 among other commitments bookingcom voluntarily extended the geographic scope of these commitments to accommodation providers throughout europe as of the same date 

with effect from august 1 2015 expedia waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in its agreements with its european hotel partners for a period of five years while expedia maintains that its parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law these waivers were nevertheless implemented as a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis following the implementation of expedias waivers nearly all ncas in europe have announced either the closure of their investigation or inquiries involving expedia or a decision not to open an investigation or inquiry involving expedia below are descriptions of additional rate parityrelated matters of note in europe 

the german federal cartel office fco has required another online travel company hotel reservation service hrs to remove certain clauses from its contracts with hotels hrs’ appeal of this decision was rejected by the higher regional court düsseldorf on january 9 2015 on december 23 2015 the fco announced that it had also required bookingcom by way of an infringement decision to remove certain clauses from its contracts with german hotels bookingcom has appealed the decision and the appeal was heard by the higher regional court düsseldorf on february 8 2017 those proceedings remain ongoing 

the italian competition authoritys case closure decision against bookingcom and expedia has subsequently been appealed by two italian hotel trade associations ie federalberghi and aica these appeals remain at an early stage and no hearing date has been fixed 

on november 6 2015 the swiss competition authority announced that it had issued a final decision finding certain parity terms existing in previous versions of agreements between swiss hotels and each of expedia bookingcom and hrs to be prohibited under swiss law the decision explicitly notes that expedias current contract terms with swiss hotels are not subject to this prohibition the swiss competition authority imposed no fines or other sanctions against expedia and did not find an abuse of a dominant market position by expedia the fco’s case against expedia’s contractual parity provisions with accommodation providers in germany remains open but is still at a preliminary stage with no formal allegations of wrongdoing having been communicated to expedia to date 

the directorate general for competition consumer affairs and repression of fraud the “dgccrf” a directorate of the french ministry of economy and finance with authority over unfair trading practices brought a lawsuit in france against expedia entities objecting to certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia entities and french hotels in may 2015 the french court ruled that certain of the parity provisions in certain contracts that were the subject of the lawsuit were not in compliance with french commercial law but imposed no fine and no injunction the dgccrf appealed the decision and on june 21 2017 the paris court of appeal published a judgment overturning the decision the court annulled parity clauses contained in the agreements at issue ordered expedia to amend its contracts and imposed a fine expedia has appealed the decision the appeal will not stay payment of the fine 

hotelverband deutschland “iha” ev a german hotel association brought proceedings before the cologne regional court against expedia inc expediacom gmbh and expedia lodging partner services sàrl iha applied for a ‘cease and desist’ order against these companies in relation to the enforcement of certain rate and availability parity clauses contained in contracts with hotels in germany on or around february 16 2017 the court dismissed iha’s action and declared the claimant liable for the expedia defendants’ statutory costs iha appealed the decision and on december 4 2017 the court of appeals rejected iha’s appeal the court of appeals expressly confirmed that expedia’s mfns are in compliance both with european and german competition law while iha had indicated an intention to appeal the decision to the federal supreme court it has not lodged an appeal within the applicable deadline with the consequence that the court of appeals judgment has now become final 

a working group of 10 european ncas belgium czech republic denmark france hungary ireland italy netherlands sweden and the united kingdom and the european commission has been established by the european competition network “ecn” at the end of 2015 to monitor the functioning of the online hotel booking sector following amendments made by a number of online travel companies including bookingcom and expedia in relation to certain parity provisions in their contracts with hotels the working group issued questionnaires to online travel agencies including expedia metasearch sites and hotels in 2016 the underlying results of the ecn monitoring exercise were published on april 6 2017 

legislative bodies in france july 2015 austria december 2016 and italy august 2017 have also adopted new domestic antiparity clause legislation expedia believes each of these pieces of legislation violates both eu and national legal principles and therefore expedia has challenged these laws at the european commission 

a motion requesting the swiss government to take action on narrow price parity has been adopted in the swiss parliament moreover in belgium the government is also reviewing narrow parity provisions the company is unable to 

predict whether these proposals in their current form or in another form will ultimately be adopted and if so when this might be the case it is not yet clear how any adopted domestic antiparity clause legislations andor any possible future legislation in this area may affect expedia’s business 

outside of europe a number of ncas have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including expedia a brazilian hotel sector association  forum de operadores hoteleiros do brasil  filed a complaint with the brazilian administrative council for economic defence “cade” against a number of online travel companies including bookingcom decolarcom and expedia on july 27 2016 with respect to parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies on september 13 2016 expedia submitted its response to the complaint to cade in late 2016 expedia resolved the concerns of the australia and new zealand ncas based on implementation of the waivers substantially similar to those provided to accommodation providers in europe on september 1 2016 in australia and on october 28 2016 in new zealand more recently however the australian nca indicated that it has reopened its investigation expedia is in ongoing discussions with a limited number of ncas in other countries in relation to its contracts with hotels expedia is currently unable to predict the impact the implementation of the waivers both in europe and elsewhere will have on expedias business on investigations or inquiries by ncas in other countries or on industry practice more generally 

in addition regulatory authorities in europe australia and elsewhere have recently initiated market studies inquiries and investigations into online marketplaces and how information is presented to consumers using those marketplaces investigating practices such as search results rankings and algorithms discount claims disclosure of charges and availability and similar messaging we are unable to predict the implications of these market studies inquiries and investigations on expedia’s business

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2016 and 2017 represented years of continuing improvement for the travel industry however political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues natural disasters and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet drove rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2018 over 45 of us and european leisure and unmanaged corporate travel expenditures are expected to occur online online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of the united states and europe and are estimated to be in the range of 30 to 40 these penetration rates increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom owned by the priceline group trivago in which expedia owns a majority interest as well as tripadvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools the impact of which is currently uncertain in addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry players such as airbnb homeaway which expedia acquired in december 2015 and bookingcom owned by the priceline group emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market many other competitors including vacation rental metasearch players continue to emerge in this space which is estimated by analysts to account for approximately 100 billion of annual travel spend and expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market furthermore we saw increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations including direct booking functionality as well as licensing deals and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites expanded their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their websites 

the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia distributes both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings for our hotel supply partners through both agencyonly contracts as well as our hybrid etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis making decisions in each applicable market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing 

agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing traveler mind share 

in may 2015 expedia sold its 624 equity stake in elong for approximately 671 million to several purchasers including ctripcom international ltd “ctrip” expedia and ctrip also reached agreement on cooperation for certain travel products in specified geographic markets the transaction closed on may 22 2015 unless otherwise noted all discussion in the “trends” and “growth strategy” sections refers to results for expedia inc excluding elong 

lodging 

lodging includes hotel accommodations as well as alternative accommodations primarily made available through homeaway as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2017 lodging accounted for 68 our room night growth has been healthy with room nights excluding elong growing 36 in 2015 32 in 2016 and 16 in 2017 adrs for rooms booked on expedia and homeaway websites excluding elong declined 5 in 2015 increased 5 in 2016 due to the acquisition of homeaway and increased 3 in 2017 

hotel we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night and profitability 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment however us dollardenominated hotel adrs declined in 2015 and 2016 due to the currency translation impact and increased in 2017 current occupancy rates for hotels in the united states remain high however us hotel supply growth has been accelerating which may put additional pressure on adrs in international markets hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as asia and certain latin american markets companies like airbnb homeaway and bookingcom also added incremental global supply in the alternative accommodations space in addition while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups in the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on thirdparty websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with more than 590000 properties on our global websites as of december 31 2017 including more than 150000 homeaway vacation rental properties now available on select brand expedia orbitz travelocity cheaptickets and ebookers websites 

alternative accommodations   with our acquisition of homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we expanded into the fast growing 100 billion alternative accommodations market homeaway is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia homeaway has been undergoing a transition from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology in addition homeaway rolled out a traveler service fee in the united states and europe during the first half of 2016 consistent with market practice the fee is expected to continue to contribute to homeaway’s revenue growth and help fund marketing investment programs to better protect travelers and future growth initiatives furthermore homeaway moved to a single subscription option globally in july 2016 in the first quarter of 2017 homeaway began integrating expedia vacation rental properties onto its websites as of december 31 2017 there are nearly 15 million online bookable listings available on homeaway 

air 

significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the us air carriers further strengthening their position however in 2015 2016 and 2017 there has been evidence of discounting by the us carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results ticket prices on expedia websites excluding elong declined 11 in 2015 6 in 2016 and 1 in 2017 as shorthaul traffic and low cost carriers grew alongside increasingly competitive airline pricing and more recently a volatile fuel pricing environment we can 

encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine and as certain supply agreements renew and continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets 

air ticket volumes excluding elong increased 35 in 2015 and 32 in 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of orbitz and 4 in 2017 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2017 air accounted for 8 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch website in addition to expedia media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2017 we generated a total of 11 billion of advertising and media revenue representing 11 of our total worldwide revenue up from 807 million in 2016

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our websites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space for more than two decades each expedia technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options we have made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace improvements in our global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia continue to enable us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands in 2013 expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded websites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas during 2014 the travelocitybranded websites were successfully migrated to the expedia technology platform in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently converted the wotifcom website to the expedia technology platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated in september 2015 expedia acquired orbitz worldwide including all of its brands the orbitz cheaptickets and ebookers websites were migrated to the expedia technology platform in the first half of 2016 and orbitz for business customers were migrated to the egencia technology platform by july 2016 in december 2015 expedia acquired homeaway inc including all of its brands additionally in june 2017 expedia acquired a majority stake in silverrail a leading rail technology distributor we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new 

countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

channel expansion technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends and some of our brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional pcs mobile bookings continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods additionally our brands implemented new technologies like voicebased search chatbots and messaging apps as mobilebased options for travelers in addition we are seeing significant crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during 2017 approximately one in three expedia inc transactions were booked globally on a mobile device 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel products including merchant and agency hotel is recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months for our vacation rental business historically homeaway has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago have typically been experienced in the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we aggressively market during the busy booking period for spring summer and winter holiday travel as a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix including the growth of homeaway may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future and there may also be business or market driven dynamics that result in shortterm impacts to revenue or profitability that differ from the typical seasonal trends we expect that as homeaway continues its shift to more of a transactionbased business model for vacation rental listings its seasonal trends will be more pronounced than our other traditional leisure businesses 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom rewards program our brand expedia expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on over 30 brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks sm  the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions the cost of these loyalty points is recorded as a reduction to revenue in our consolidated financial statements we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

business combinations 

we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and if applicable record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value periodically we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment prior to performing the quantitative analysis to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary which is based on market valuation the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our 

equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted in december 2017 the tax act significantly changes us tax law by among other things lowering us corporate income tax rates implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax act reduces the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date we have recognized the provisional impacts related to the onetime transition tax and revaluation of deferred tax balances and included these estimates in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the ultimate impact may materially differ from these provisional amounts due to among other things additional 

analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the tax act in addition foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy and other taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques including the blackscholes and monte carlo optionpricing models we amortize the fair value over the remaining term on a straightline basis we account for forfeitures as they occur the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

in addition we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in sixteen lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 43 million  as of december 31 2017  and 71 million  as of december 31 2016  

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina minnesota oregon rhode island and maryland the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including to the states of new york south carolina north carolina minnesota georgia wyoming oregon rhode island montana maryland kentucky and maine the district of columbia and the city of new york as well as certain other county and local jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity for additional information including significant paytoplay payments made by expedia companies see note 17 — commitments and contingencies   legal proceedings  paytoplay in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other jurisdictions  we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities some of which including in the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax “vat” to our european union related transactions impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

segments 

we have four reportable segments core ota trivago homeaway upon its acquisition on december 15 2015 and egencia in addition elong was a reportable segment through its disposal on may 22 2015 our core ota segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world orbitz cheaptickets ebookers ean hotwirecom travelocity wotif group carrentalscom classic vacations and silverrail technologies inc our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites our homeaway segment operates an online marketplace for the vacation rental industry our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

when homeaway properties are booked through our core ota websites and vice versa the segments split the thirdparty revenue for management and segment reporting purposes with the majority of the thirdparty revenue residing with the website marketing the property or room the operating metrics including gross bookings and room nights are not split but instead generally reside entirely with the website marketing the property or room 

gross bookings and revenue margin 



 



the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to growth in the core ota segment including growth at brand expedia hotelscom and ean as well as growth at homeaway the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily driven by the inorganic impact from acquisitions of 22 growth in the core ota segment including growth at brand expedia and hotelscom as well as growth at egencia 

revenue margin increased in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to a mix shift to higher margin products including growth in advertising and media revenue and the favorable impact of lower air ticket prices partially offset by lower revenue per room night and lower homeaway revenue margins revenue margin increased in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the favorable impact of lower air ticket prices and a mix shift to higher margin products including advertising and media revenue these impacts were partially offset by the inclusion of a higher share of lower margin air gross bookings with the acquisition of orbitz and lower revenue per room night 

results of operations 

on may 22 2015 we completed the sale of our 624 ownership stake in elong the below discussion of the results of operations for 2015 include results for elong through its disposal on may 22 2015 operating expense tables below present total expenses including elong for 2015 as well as elong specific amounts included within the consolidated total

selling and marketing expenses increased 931 million  during 2017  compared to 2016  driven by an increase of  830 million  of direct costs including online and offline marketing expenses trivago brand expedia ean and hotelscom   accounted for the majority of the total direct cost increases in addition higher indirect costs of 101 million  also contributed to the increase and were primarily driven by growth in personnel at egencia as well as in the lodging supply organization 

selling and marketing expenses increased 986 million  during 2016  compared to 2015 driven by an increase of 812 million  of direct costs including online and offline marketing expenses trivago brand expedia and hotelscom as well as the added costs from our acquisitions of homeaway and orbitz accounted for the majority of the total direct cost increase in addition higher indirect costs of 174 million  also contributed to the increase and were driven by additional personnel due to an accelerated pace of hiring in the lodging supply organization in the first half of the year and additional headcount at homeaway and orbitz acquisitions added approximately 14 of yearonyear selling and marketing growth for 2016

general and administrative expense decreased 2 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily related to a decrease in professional fees and other on lower stockbased compensation of  63 million  yearoveryear resulting from the current year reversal of approximately 41 million of previously recognized stockbased compensation expense related to the departure of our former ceo as well as the absence of certain 2016 stockbased compensation charges related to trivago partially offset by an increase in professional fees in addition personnel and overhead expenses also increased 42 million  primarily driven by the organic growth of the business 

general and administrative expense increased 104 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher personnel and overhead expenses of 81 million  driven by the organic growth of the business and the inorganic addition of homeaway and orbitz in addition stockbased compensation increased 28 million yearoveryear which included increases related to trivago as well as in general employee stockbased compensation that were partially offset by the absence of elong related stockbased compensation in 2016 acquisitions added approximately 7 of yearonyear general and administrative growth for 2016 which reflects the addition of a full year of expenses for homeaway and orbitz partially offset by higher acquisitionrelated expenses in 2015 

amortization and impairment of intangible assets 



amortization of intangible assets decreased 42 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets partially offset by 11 million of amortization related to new business acquisitions in the current year in 2016  amortization increased 161 million primarily due to amortization related to new business acquisitions in the prior year partially offset by the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets 

in 2016  and 2015  we recorded impairment losses of 35 million  and 7 million  related to indefinitelived trade names within our core ota segment due to changes in estimated future revenues of the related brands 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 



legal reserves occupancy tax and other consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2017  the expense primarily related to changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes 

during 2016  we recognized approximately 12 million for amounts expected to be paid in advance of litigation related to merchant car rental transactions in connection with hawaiis general excise tax litigation the remaining expense in 2016 related to changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes 

during 2015  we received a refund of prepaid paytoplay payments of 132 million from the state of hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation in addition during 2015  we recorded a 24 million benefit in legal reserves occupancy tax and other for the recovery of costs related to occupancy tax litigation matters these gains were partially offset by charges for changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes 

for additional information see note 17 — commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and related reorganization charges 

in connection with activities to centralize and optimize certain operations as well as migrate technology platforms in the prior years primarily related to previously disclosed acquisitions we recognized 17 million  56 million  and 105 million  in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2017  2016  and 2015  the charges were primarily related to employee severance and benefits including severance amounts under preexisting written plans and contracts orbitz had with its employees and incremental retention compensation for existing employees as well as stockcompensation charges for acceleration of replacement awards pursuant to certain employee agreements based on current plans which are subject to change and excluding any possible future acquisition integrations we do not expect to incur material restructuring charges in 2018 

for additional information see note 15 — restructuring and related reorganization charges  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating income 



in 2017  operating income increased primarily due to growth in revenue and a decrease in most major expense categories as a percentage of revenue partially offset by growth in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue in 2017 

in 2016  operating income increased primarily due to higher growth in revenue and the absence of elong operating losses partially offset by increased costs and expenses including growth in technology and content expense in excess of revenue growth higher amortization of intangible assets as well as the comparative impact of the 2015 hawaii paytoplay gain of 132 million 

included in our consolidated operating income for 2015 are operating losses for elong through its disposition date of may 22 2015 of 86 million 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

 

1 adjusted ebitda is a nongaap measure see definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda below for more information 

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric see note 19 — segment information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions unallocated overhead costs and for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income loss attributable to expedia inc for the periods presented above 

core ota adjusted ebitda increased 103 million  and 366 million  during 2017 and 2016 primarily due to an increase of 797 million  and 12 billion  in revenue partially offset by an increase in online marketing expense mostly at brand expedia ean and hotelscom and including an increase in online spend at trivago the acquisition of orbitz contributed to 264 million to the increase in core ota adjusted ebitda for 2016 

trivago adjusted ebitda declined 30 million  during 2017 the deterioration was largely driven by a sudden change in advertising bidding at the end of the second quarter of 2017 resulting in a sharp decline in revenue growth marketing spend in particular precommitted television spend could not be adjusted to an optimal level timely enough and resulted in the declining profitability trivago adjusted ebitda increased 32 million  during 2016 primarily due to an increase of 288 million in revenue driven by continued global expansion and market share gains including 83 million in intersegment revenue growth from core ota revenue growth during 2016 was partially offset by higher online and offline marketing expense 

homeaway adjusted ebitda increased 27 million  during 2017 due to an increase of 217 million  in revenue partially offset by higher selling and marketing and technology and content expense during the current year homeaway has continued to invest in offline and online brand marketing to bring more demand to its supply base and in growing its product and technology teams the increase during 2016 was due to our acquisition of the company in december 2015 

egencia adjusted ebitda increased 13 million  during 2017 primarily due to an increase in revenue of 59 million  as a result of adding new corporate clients and room night growth as well as scale efficiencies partially offset by investments in sales product and technology egencia adjusted ebitda increased 13 million  in 2016 primarily due to the addition of orbitz for business 

unallocated overhead costs increased 16 million  during 2017 primarily due to higher general and administrative professional fees as well as personnel and overhead costs partially offset by lower technology and content expense as we lap over an accelerated pace of technology hiring in the prior year unallocated overhead costs increased 131 million  during 2016 primarily due to increased technology and content expense to support key corporate technology projects as well as higher general and administrative personnel and overhead costs the acquisition of orbitz contributed 27 million to the increase in unallocated overhead costs for 2016 

interest income and expense 



interest income increased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher invested balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return interest income increased in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher rates of return partially offset by lower invested balances 

interest expense increased in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily as a result of additional interest on the 1 billion senior unsecured notes issued in september 2017 interest expense increased in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of additional interest on the euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes issued in june 2015 and the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in december 2015 

as of december 31 2017  our senior unsecured notes indebtedness totaled 42 billion  as of december 31 2016 and 2015  our indebtedness totaled 32 billion 

gain on sale of business 

on may 22 2015 we completed the sale of our 624 ownership stake in elong inc for approximately 671 million or 666 million net of costs to sell and other transaction expenses to several purchasers including ctripcom international ltd as a result of the sale we recognized a pretax gain of 509 million 395 million after tax during 2015 included in gain on sale of business in our consolidated statement of operations 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 



provision for income taxes   

our effective tax rate for 2017  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower as well as excess tax benefits related to sharebased payments the net increase in our effective rate for 2017  compared to 2016  was primarily due to onetime tax benefits in the prior year period including release of a valuation allowance and return to provision trueups as well as an increase in losses generated in foreign jurisdictions at tax rates below the 35 federal statutory rate the effects of the provisional income inclusion for the deemed repatriation transition tax pursuant to the tax act were negated by the benefit of the provisional remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability   

the decrease in the effective rate for 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to tax benefits from the adoption of new accounting guidance relating to stockbased compensation and the release of valuation allowances in the united kingdom and germany on cumulative foreign net operating losses for which it is more likely than not the tax benefit will be realized as a 

result of lower pretax earnings in 2016 the impacts of these benefits create a significant effect on our effective tax rate   our effective tax rate for 2016  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states as well as the same factors impacting the yearoveryear effective tax rate comparison 

our effective rate for 2015 was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states as well as the sale of elong which had a us effective rate of less than 35 

for additional information including additional information on the impacts of the tax act see note 11 — income taxes   in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda 

we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters which may ultimately be settled in cash and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above in the legal proceedings section as well as the notes to the financial statements the nongaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to expedia adjusted for 1 net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 2 provision for income taxes 3 total other expenses net 4 stockbased compensation expense including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans 5 acquisitionrelated impacts including i amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment ii gains losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements if any and iii upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree if any 6 certain other items including restructuring 7 items included in legal reserves occupancy tax and other 8 that portion of gains losses on revenue hedging activities that are included in other net that relate to revenue recognized in the period and 9 depreciation 

the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future ongoing performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors moreover our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments in addition we believe that by excluding certain items such as stockbased compensation and acquisitionrelated impacts adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 

the reconciliation of net income attributable to expedia inc to adjusted ebitda is as follows 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 33 billion  and 19 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  and our 15 billion revolving credit facility which is essentially untapped as of december 31 2017 the total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments held outside the united states was 16 billion 13 billion in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries and 315 million in majorityowned subsidiaries for which the amount available to be repatriated is still being determined we believe any amount repatriated would not incur significant additional taxes additionally we expect to pay minimal taxes for the 2017 mandatory repatriation required by the tax act due to the use of our existing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

in september 2017 we privately placed 1 billion of senior unsecured notes that are due in february 2028 and bear interest at 38 in january 2018 we completed an offer to exchange these notes for registered notes having substantially the same financial terms and covenants as the original notes the unregistered and registered notes collectively the 38 notes the 38 notes were issued at 99747 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in arrears in february and august of each year beginning february 15 2018 we used or expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes which may include but are not limited to the repayment prepayment redemption or repurchase of our indebtedness including but not limited to our 7456 senior notes due 2018 as well as working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions 

as of december 31 2017  we maintained a 15 billion revolving credit facility with a february 2021 maturity date the facility contains various restrictive covenants including a maximum permissible leverage ratio and a minimum permissible interest coverage ratio and interest payable under the facility is based on the company’s credit ratings as of december 31 2017  the maximum permissible leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage were both 325 to 100 the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts was libor plus 1375 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts was 175 basis points 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2017  moody’s rating was ba1 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt which was comprised of 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2018 that bear 

interest at 7456 the “7456 notes” 750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 595 the “595 notes” 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 45 the “45 notes” euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 25 the 25 notes 750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 50 the 50 notes and the 38 notes 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel advertising or certain expedia affiliate network relationships or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers such as with mobile bookings via smartphones our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by homeaways continued shift to more of a transactional model from a subscription model 

as our etp program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling up of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow relative liquidity during the transition and hotel revenue margins 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp as well as the transformation of the homeaway vacation rental listing business may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2017  we had a deficit in our working capital of 23 billion  compared to a deficit of 27 billion as of december 31 2016 the change in the deficit was primarily due to operating cash flows as well as proceeds from the 38 notes issued in september 2017 partially offset by investing activities including capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements in infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts in addition in 2016 we began our expansion into the cloud computing environment while we expect our cloud computing expenses to increase significantly over the next few years they are expected to result in lower overall capital expenditures related to our data centers over time our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt excluding capital expenditures associated with the build out of our new corporate headquarters we expect total capital expenditures for 2018 to increase over 2017 spending levels our current estimates for the new headquarters total approximately 700 to 900 million with final estimates contingent on completion of design plans and final determination of completed office space required in the initial build out of the total approximately 30 million was spent in 2016 and approximately 70 million in 2017 we plan to make significant progress on our corporate headquarters building in the coming year spending approximately 230 million in 2018 followed by nearly 450 million in 2019 when we expect to begin to move into the campus 

our cash flows are as follows 



in 2017  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 235 million  primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes driven mostly from a change in deferred merchant bookings in 2016 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 196 million primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for impacts of depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in benefits from working capital adjustments and a net refund of hotel occupancy and other taxes in 2015 

in 2017  cash used in investing activities increased by 864 million  due to net purchase of investments of 715 million in the current year compared to cash provided by net sales of investments of 16 million in the prior year and an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 170 million in 2017 these increases were partially offset by 6 million cash inflow in the 2017 due to the net settlement of foreign currency forwards compared to 53 million cash outflow in 2016 as well as lower capital expenditures of 39 million in the current year in 2016 cash used in investing activities decreased by 17 billion primarily due to a decrease of cash used for acquisitions of 21 billion partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds related to the sale of elong of 457 million in 2015 

cash provided by financing activities in 2017  primarily included 990 million  of net proceeds from the issuance of 38 notes in september 2017 as well as 229 million  of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 312 million  including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below and a 176 million  cash dividend payment cash used in financing activities in 2016 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 456 million the repayment of 401 million of homeaway convertible notes and 150 million cash dividend payment partially offset by 215 million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of trivago as well as 141 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans cash provided by financing activities in 2015 primarily included 700 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 25 notes in june 2015 741 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the 50 notes in december 2015 120 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock and 91 million in excess tax benefit on equity awards of which approximately 47 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our chairman and senior executive these financing inflows were offset in part by 85 million of withholding taxes for stock option exercises paid on behalf of our chairman and senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled as well as cash paid to acquire shares of 61 million primarily under the repurchase authorizations discussed below and 109 million cash dividend payments 

during 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during each of the respective years and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 70 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 



  

 as of december 31 2017  49 million  shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2015 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases 

our common stock dividend was 116  per share for 2017  100  per share for 2016  and 084  per share for 2015  see note 13 — stockholders’ equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition in february 2018 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 030  per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 28 2018  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 8 2018  future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2017  showed a net change of 181 million  reflecting net appreciations in foreign currencies in 2017  compared to net depreciations in 2016  the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2016 showed a net change of 92 million reflecting lower depreciations in foreign currencies in 2016 compared to 2015 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2017  



  

 other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017

 part ii item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 in september 2017 we issued 1 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 38 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes 595 notes 25 notes 45 notes 50 notes and 38 notes were approximately 516 million  810 million  828 million  528 million  807 million  and 969 million  as of december 31 2017  as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 2 million our 595 notes by approximately 10 million our 25 notes by approximately 17 million our 45 notes by approximately 15 million our 50 notes by approximately 27 million and our 38 notes by approximately 41 million 

we maintain a 15 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  or 2015  

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2017  we had a net forward asset of 6 million  included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of december 31 2016  we had a net forward liability of 4 million  included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded 

eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 26 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2017  as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 46 million 40 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 15 million 30 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 25 million 15 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion 

new channel penetration  technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings made through mobile devices in addition to more traditional methods like desktop and laptop computers in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends and some of our brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional desktops mobile bookings via smartphones continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we had historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods in addition we are seeing increasing crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during the year ended december 31 2016  nearly one in three expedia inc transactions were booked globally on a mobile device 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model in addition upon our acquisition of homeaway in december 2015 we also earn revenue related to subscriptionbased vacation rental listing and other ancillary services provided to property owners and managers as well as from the traveler service fee that was rolled out in the united states and europe in the first half of 2016 

under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings the majority of our merchant transactions relate to hotel bookings under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia in advance under our merchant program expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect growth in our etp program has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs and as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions based on these dynamics we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through various of our expediabranded and other websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled 

by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transactionbased websites 

with our acquisition of homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we have expanded into the fast growing 100 billion alternative accommodations market homeaway is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia homeaway has been undergoing a transition from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology in addition homeaway rolled out a traveler service fee in the united states and europe during the first half of 2016 consistent with market practice the fee is expected to continue to contribute to homeaway’s revenue growth and help fund marketing investment programs to better protect travelers and future growth initiatives furthermore homeaway moved to a single subscription option globally in july 2016 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines destination service providers and homeaway property owners and managers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed via a proprietary extranet 

in addition homeaway’s vacation rental listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers which enables them to manage an availability calendar reservations inquiries and the content of the listing as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers to our sites 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media sites offline advertising loyalty programs mobile apps and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include hotelscom rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia ®  rewards on over 30 brand expedia points of sale as well as orbitz rewards on orbitzcom the cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated financial statements

all of our brands share and benefit from our corporate technology infrastructure including customer support data centers and transaction processing capabilities 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador egypt and india we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering more favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers 

and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels alternative accommodation sites rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks copyright domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

additionally we are subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry 

some of these laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our various business models

 part i item 1a risk factors 

 you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including 



 online and traditional travel agencies  we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies “otas” in many regions such as the priceline group and its subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom as well as regional competitors such as ctrip which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in addition the global ota market continues to consolidate with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships we also compete with traditional travel agencies operating both offline and online wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers  travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications in the past year certain hotel chains have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as favorable rates increased or exclusive product availability complimentary wifi and their own bonus miles or loyalty points or in the case of airlines promote hotel supply at their websites which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

search engines  we also face increasing competition from search engines including google to the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning shopping or booking capabilities or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites or offer the ability to transact on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas in addition these search engines continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our websites or websites in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivagobranded websites compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases than we do we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch engines  travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of priceline trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia tripadvisor and qunar a subsidiary of ctrip aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch sites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize the metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise trivago’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile platform travel applications  mobile platforms including smartphones and tablet computers continue to grow significantly the improved functionality of mobile platforms has led to an increased use by consumers of standalone applications to research and book travel if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications and websites for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications and websites are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

social media websites social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition notably facebook has launched dynamic ads for travel product expanding its reach into the travel market 

alternative accommodations  airbnb and similar websites that facilitate the shortterm rental of homes and apartments from owners provide an alternative to hotel rooms and vacation rental properties available through expedia websites including homeaway the continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and vacation rentals furthermore airbnb and similar websites have added other travel services such as tours activities hotel and flight bookings any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional otas 

other participants in the travel industry traditional consumer ecommerce websites and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites to the extent such websites continue to expand these services over time it may create additional competition in addition car rideshare services such as uber increasingly compete with the traditional car rental services that we offer on our retail websites and to our corporate clients which may negatively affect our carbased and corporate travel businesses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

  

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in evolving channels such as metasearch and mobile as well as offering new consumer choices including inventory types and transactional models and increasing supplier inventory on our existing platforms through acquisitions and partnerships if we fail to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments our business could be adversely affected our attempts to adapt our current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives different legal or tax requirements inadequate return on investments difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto our platforms as well as limit our ability to develop new site features in addition adaptations to our business may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs and increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers in addition these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch engines including kayak and tripadvisor pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes adopt emerging technologies such as voice alter its search algorithms or results any of which could cause a website to place lower in search query results or inhibit 

participation in the search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates or those of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent in addition certain metasearch companies have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites to the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers gds partners as well as owners and managers of vacation rental properties a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers airlines and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm hotel and airline contracts 

no assurances can be given that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce average daily rates “adrs” attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of these actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example during regional or global recessions domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slow spending on the services we provide and have a negative impact on our revenue growth additionally if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions andor significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the us dollar it can lead to a negative impact on our foreign denominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance political instability including as a result of the recent united kingdom “brexit” referendum to withdraw from the european union geopolitical conflicts significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future for example the paris terrorist attacks in november 2015 had a negative impact in the fourth quarter of 2015 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and adrs decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 



such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing   

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including increased spending from our competitors promotional and discounting activities the increasing costs of our growing customer loyalty programs the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among our multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative travelrelated traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines during 2016 certain online travel companies and metasearch sites continued to expand their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio in addition our decisions over allocation of resources and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in our portfolio at the expense of not investing in or reducing our investments in other brands in our portfolio could have an overall negative financial impact if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings the emergence of cloud computing the growth of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms have and will continue to require new and costly investments in technology transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third party service providers for example we are beginning to ramp up a multiyear project to migrate products and functionality and significantly increase our utilization of cloud computing services such as amazon web services in addition we may not be successful or may be less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as a service provider could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site features in addition during the migration process the sites have in the past and 

may continue in the future to experience reduced functionality decreases in conversion rates and increased costs relating to maintaining redundant systems also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems or enhancements to existing infrastructure technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our homeaway business is in the process of transitioning to a primarily transactionbased business which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

we are subject to legal financial and competitive risk associated with homeaway’s transition to a primarily transactionbased business homeaway historically generated the majority of its revenues when owners or managers of vacation rentals paid homeaway subscription fees for the listing of their properties on the homeaway family of sites while subscription fees were the predominant source of revenue for homeaway a growing share of homeaway’s revenue is now generated from a commissionbased business model where the traveler pays a service fee for the use of the homeaway platform and the owner or manager of the property pays homeaway a fee or a commission on a transactional basis for each booking of the property by a traveler homeaway launched the traveler service fee and introduced its book with confidence guarantee in the united states beginning in february 2016 followed by a rollout in europe beginning in june 2016 in addition homeaway moved to a single subscription option for its homeowners and property manager partners in july 2016 homeaway’s business model transition involves significant additional risks and potential costs for homeaway including 

 these risks could have a material adverse effect on homeaway’s business and results of operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia’s operations and financial results 

in addition homeaway has been and continues to be subject to regulatory development that affect the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like us to list those vacation rentals online for example some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or otherwise limit their ability to do so and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm vacation rentals in addition many of the fundamental statutes and ordinances that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce which creates a risk of these laws being used in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue has increased from 39 in 2010 to 43 in 2016 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we begin to operate in new markets and countries we must tailor our services and business models to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

as we continue to grow our global presence we accumulate a greater portion of our cash balances outside of the united states in our foreign subsidiaries repatriation of cash balances by our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may result in a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 

 the china travel market in particular is significant and has grown significantly in recent years prior to may 2015 we conducted our operations in china primarily through our majority ownership interest in elong inc a leading online travel service provider in china following the sale of our elong ownership stake in may 2015 to a group of chinabased purchasers including to a subsidiary of ctrip international ltd we have conducted our business in china through localized websites and commercial arrangements with local partners including ctrip there can be no guarantee that we will be able to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in china and our failure to do so could significantly impact our ability to grow our overall business 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and vacation rental licensing and listing requirements the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security and privacy as a result regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising 

taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations and anticorruption laws across industries us trade sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries including cuba iran north korea sudan syria and the crimea region of the ukraine and nationals and others of those countries as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities we believe that our activities comply with ofac european union and united kingdom economic sanction and trade regulations and anticorruption regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the uk bribery act as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands 

we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia described in part i item 3 legal proceedings  hotel booking practices proceedings and litigation the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

furthermore our future growth may be limited by antitrust or competition laws for example our business has grown and continues to expand and as a consequence increases in our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of various domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities these taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues this has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities as such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries filed lawsuits and levied assessments asserting we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy state and local sales or use taxes or other taxes including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple european union jurisdictions regarding the application of value added tax to our european union transactions as well as in multiple jurisdictions globally while we believe we comply with applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate tax authorities may conclude we owe additional taxes we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity which payments may be substantial this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes for example as a precondition to challenging the assessments in 2015 we paid 23 million under protest to the city of portland oregon and multnomah county oregon during 2009 we paid 48 million under protest to the city of san francisco and an additional 255 million under protest on may 26 2014 in connection with additional assessments and during 2013 we paid 171 million to the state of hawaii in september 2015 following a ruling by the hawaii supreme court the state of hawaii refunded the expedia companies 132 million of the original “paytoplay” amount and orbitz also received a similar refund of 22 million the expedia companies intend to appeal the august 5 

2016 decision by the hawaii tax court holding that taxes are due on the online travel companies’ services to facilitate merchant model car rental transactions in which case the expedia companies will be expected to pay under protest the full amount claimed due or approximately 165 million as a condition of appeal significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges including the amount of or basis for such charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes we believe our tax estimates are reasonable however the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on information technology systems including the internet and thirdparty hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data including booking transactions intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments accounting procurement and supply chain activities in addition we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent additionally as we continue to integrate our acquired companies such as orbitz into our information technology systems we may increase the risk of these system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon — including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers — and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business we devote significant resources to network security monitoring and testing employee training and other security measures but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information intellectual property proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in our operations we may need to expend additional significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and a security breach resulting in the reduction of website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently are often not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to our contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users and our business partners to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for their own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

in addition no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time in addition any remediation efforts may be costly for which we may not have adequate insurance to cover such losses or costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

amendment to existing tax laws rules or regulations or enactment of new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

many of the underlying laws rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the digital economy if the tax laws rules or regulations were amended or if new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations were enacted particularly with respect to occupancy sales valueadded taxes or unclaimed property or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively subject us to interest and penalties decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions as a result these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

in addition in the past us and foreign governments have introduced proposals for tax legislation or have adopted tax laws that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate or increase our tax liabilities the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example in october 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to “base erosion and profit shifting” “beps” by multinational companies multiple member jurisdictions including countries in which we operate have begun implementing recommended changes such as country by country reporting “cbcr” the cbcr standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies the cbcr disclosure is expected to result in increased global tax audit activity additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years certain countries have adopted unilateral changes increasing the risk of double taxation any changes to us or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and adversely affect our profitability our tax liabilities in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with relevant authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws and regulations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

we are subject to paymentsrelated and fraud risks 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity moreover there can be no assurances that the interchange rates or the fees we pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce our revenue thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

in addition credit card networks such as visa mastercard and american express have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include payment card association operating rules the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss under these rules we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use storage and security of card data we assess our compliance with the pci dss rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls failure to comply may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and could prevent us from processing or accepting credit cards 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones and tablet computers and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity in addition for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 



 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

due to our increasing international presence we may continue to accumulate a greater portion of our cash flows in certain foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings would likely result in additional us income tax expense in addition we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see growth in both our merchant expedia collect and our agency hotel collect hotel products to the extent our merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline it would likely result in pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

  

we process store and use personal information payment card information and other consumer data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations 

we may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information payment card information and other consumer data the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information payment card information or other consumer data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in the company as 

well as subject us to bank fines penalties or increased transaction costs all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online in addition the european court of justice’s invalidation of the useu safe harbor framework could make it more difficult for us to transfer data outside of the european union for processing and the european union’s reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance finally countries in other regions most notably asia eastern europe and latin america are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees for example additional barriers to or restricts on travel for professional or personal purposes such as those in the united states in early 2017 may cause significant disruption to our businesses or negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected 

  

in addition we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

mr diller currently effectively controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty expedia holdings inc may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty expedia holdings which proxy has been assigned by mr diller to liberty expedia holdings until the earlier of may 4 2018 or the occurrence of certain termination events by virtue of the agreements between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings and their respective holdings in expedia the voting power of an irrevocable proxy granted to mr diller by john c malone and leslie malone over their shares in liberty expedia holdings and the governance arrangements at liberty expedia holdings during the period the assignment of the diller proxy and the proxy granted him by the malones are in effect mr diller is effectively able to control the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty expedia holdings could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock as a result of their agreements and respective holdings in expedia mr diller and liberty expedia holdings may be deemed to share voting power over securities representing approximately 54 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2016 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty expedia holdings inc and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty expedia holdings generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty expedia holdings will consent to any such 

matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s and liberty expedia holdings’ ownership interests and voting power the agreements between mr diller and liberty expedia holdings and between mr diller and the malones and the governance structure at liberty expedia holdings mr diller is currently in a position to control or influence and liberty expedia holdings is in a position to influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets as a result of liberty expedia holdings’ ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia in the future liberty expedia holdings may be in a position to control or influence such corporate actions this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that mr diller and mr kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

  

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities   

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia affiliate network business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers on which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2016 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 13 billion primarily in bank of america bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj bnp paribas hsbc and jpmorgan chase and held time deposits of approximately 324 million at financial institutions including bnp paribas jpmorgan chase mizuho bank ltd national australia bank and standard chartered bank additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 313 million primarily in deutsche bank and national australia bank as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2016 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 19 billion the fair value of which was a liability of approximately 4 million the counterparties to these contracts were barclays bank bnp paribas bank of america the bank of tokyomitsubishi ufj citibank credit suisse international goldman sachs hsbc jpmorgan chase mizuho royal bank of canada standard chartered bank the bank of nova scotia societe generale and wells fargo we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties 

were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts 

in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have outstanding longterm indebtedness with a face value of 32 billion and we have a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility risks relating to our indebtedness include 

 the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites and mobile applications rely on content brands domain names and technology much of which is proprietary we establish and protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark domain name copyright trade secret and patent laws in the us and other jurisdictions license and confidentiality agreements and internal policies and procedures in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information and intellectual property even with these precautions however it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark domain name copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention

competition reviews litigation and legislation regarding parity clauses 

over the last several years the online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities ncas particularly in europe expedia is or has been involved in investigations predominately related to whether certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia entities and accommodation providers sometimes also referred to as most favored nation or mfn provisions are anticompetitive 

in europe investigations or inquiries into contractual parity provisions between hotels and online travel companies including expedia were initiated in 2012 2013 and 2014 by ncas in austria belgium czech republic denmark france germany greece hungary ireland italy poland sweden and switzerland while the ultimate outcome of some of these investigations or inquiries remains uncertain and expedia’s circumstances are distinguishable from other online travel companies subject to similar investigations and inquiries we note in this context that on april 21 2015 the french italian and swedish ncas working in close cooperation with the european commission announced that they had accepted formal commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve and close the investigations against bookingcom in france italy and sweden by bookingcom removing andor modifying certain rate conditions and availability parity provisions in its contracts with accommodation providers in france italy and sweden as of july 1 2015 among other commitments bookingcom voluntarily extended the geographic scope of these commitments to accommodation providers throughout europe as of the same date 

with effect from august 1 2015 expedia waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in its agreements with its european hotel partners for a period of five years while expedia maintains that its parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law these waivers were nevertheless implemented as a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis following the implementation of expedias waivers nearly all ncas in europe have announced either the closure of their investigation or inquiries involving expedia or a decision not to open an investigation or inquiry involving expedia below are descriptions of additional rate parityrelated matters of note in europe 

the german federal cartel office fco has required another online travel company hotel reservation service hrs to remove certain clauses from its contracts with hotels hrs’ appeal of this decision was rejected by the higher regional court düsseldorf on january 9 2015 on december 23 2015 the fco announced that it had also required bookingcom by way of an infringement decision to remove certain clauses from its contracts with german hotels bookingcom has appealed the decision and the appeal will be heard by the higher regional court düsseldorf on february 8 2017 

the italian competition authoritys case closure decision against bookingcom and expedia has subsequently been appealed by two italian hotel trade associations ie federalberghi and aica these appeals remain at an early stage and no hearing date has been fixed 

on november 6 2015 the swiss competition authority announced that it had issued a final decision finding certain parity terms existing in previous versions of agreements between swiss hotels and each of expedia bookingcom and hrs to be prohibited under swiss law the decision explicitly notes that expedias current contract terms with swiss hotels are not subject to this prohibition the swiss competition authority imposed no fines or other sanctions against expedia and did not find an abuse of a dominant market position by expedia the fco’s case against expedia’s contractual parity provisions with 

accommodation providers in germany remains open but is still at a preliminary stage with no formal allegations of wrongdoing having been communicated to expedia to date 

the directorate general for competition consumer affairs and repression of fraud the “dgccrf” a directorate of the french ministry of economy and finance with authority over unfair trading practices brought a lawsuit in france against expedia entities objecting to certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia entities and french hotels in may 2015 the french court ruled that certain of the parity provisions in certain contracts that were the subject of the lawsuit were not in compliance with french commercial law but imposed no fine and no injunction the dgccrf has appealed the decision 

hotelverband deutschland iha ev a german hotel association brought proceedings before the cologne regional court against expedia inc expediacom gmbh and expedia lodging partner services sàrl iha has applied for a ‘cease and desist’ order against these companies in relation to the enforcement of certain rate and availability parity clauses contained in contracts with hotels in germany 

a working group of 10 european ncas belgium czech republic denmark france hungary ireland italy netherlands sweden and the uk and the european commission has been established by the european competition network “ecn” at the end of 2015 to monitor the functioning of the online hotel booking sector following amendments made by a number of online travel companies including bookingcom and expedia in relation to certain parity provisions in their contracts with hotels the working group has issued questionnaires to online travel agencies including expedia metasearch sites and hotels in 2016 and is expected to report its results early in 2017 

legislative bodies in certain countries have also adopted or are proposing to adopt new domestic antiparity clause legislation on july 9 2015 the french national assembly adopted article 133 of the loi macron article 133 that seeks to define the nature of the relationship between online reservation platforms and french hotels article 133 became effective on august 8 2015 expedia considers that article 133 was drafted ambiguously and can be interpreted in a way that violates both eu and french legal principles therefore expedia has submitted a complaint to the european commission relating to article 133 however following the effective date expedia has been in contact with its hotel partners in france regarding the impact of article 133 legislation banning certain parity provisions in contracts between online travel companies and austrian accommodation providers became effective on december 31 2016 expedia believes this legislation violates both eu and austrian legal principles and therefore expedia has submitted a complaint to the european commission relating to this legislation 

a legislative proposal to prohibit narrow price parity clauses in hotelota agreements in italy is still pending in the italian senate and a motion requesting the swiss government to take action on narrow price parity is currently under discussion in the swiss parliament the company is unable to predict whether these proposals in their current form or in another form will ultimately be adopted and if so when this might be the case it is not yet clear how any adopted domestic antiparity clause legislations andor any possible future legislation in this area may affect expedia’s business 

outside of europe a number of ncas have also opened investigations or inquired about contractual parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies in their respective territories including expedia a brazilian hotel sector association — forum de operadores hoteleiros do brasil — filed a complaint with the brazilian administrative council for economic defence “cade” against a number of online travel companies including bookingcom decolarcom and expedia on july 27 2016 with respect to parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies on september 13 2016 expedia submitted its response to the complaint to cade expedia recently resolved the concerns of the australia and new zealand ncas based on implementation of the waivers substantially similar to those provided to accommodation providers in europe on september 1 2016 in australia and on october 28 2016 in new zealand expedia is in ongoing discussions with a limited number of ncas in other countries in relation to its contracts with hotels expedia is currently unable to predict the impact the implementation of the waivers both in europe and elsewhere will have on expedias business on investigations or inquiries by ncas in other countries or on industry practice more generally 

the company is unable to predict how any pending appeals of administrative decisions and the remaining open investigations and inquiries by ncas will ultimately be resolved or whether further action in europe will be taken as a result of the ecn’s working groups assessment and findings once published possible outcomes include requiring expedia to amend or remove certain parity clauses from its contracts with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions andor the imposition of fines 

it is not yet clear how any adopted domestic antiparity clause legislations andor any possible future legislation in this area may affect expedia’s business competitionrelated investigations legislation or issues could also give rise to private litigation for example expedia is involved in private litigation in germany related to its current contractual parity provisions see above we are unable to predict how such litigation will be resolved or whether it will impact expedia’s business in germany

all percentages within this section are calculated on actual unrounded numbers 

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2015  and 2016  represented years of continuing improvement for the travel industry however political instability geopolitical conflicts acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures   according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2016 over 50 of us and european leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of the united states and europe and are estimated to be in the range of 30 to 40 these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom owned by the priceline group trivago in which expedia owns a majority interest as well as tripadvisor introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools the impact of which is currently uncertain in addition the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy” accelerated by online penetration has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry players such as airbnb and homeaway which expedia acquired in december 2015 have emerged as the leaders bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market many other competitors including vacation rental metasearch players continue to emerge in this space which is estimated to account for approximately 100 billion of annual travel spend and expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market furthermore we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations including direct booking functionality as well as licensing deals and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites have been expanding their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia has both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings for our hotel supply partners and we expect our use of these models to continue to evolve including through the continued expansion of our etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis at the local or regional level making decisions in each market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity 

to be attractive the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing consumer mind share 

in may 2015 expedia sold its 624 equity stake in elong for approximately 671 million to several purchasers including ctripcom international ltd “ctrip” expedia and ctrip also reached agreement on cooperation for certain travel products in specified geographic markets the transaction closed on may 22 2015 unless otherwise noted all discussion in the “trends” and “growth strategy” sections refers to results for expedia inc excluding elong 

hotel 

we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners have remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced and expect to continue to reduce our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth additionally increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs contribute to declines in revenue per room night lastly currency exchange rate fluctuations have had a negative effect on unit economics due to unfavorable booktostay as well as translation impacts based on these dynamics our average revenue per room night declined in each quarter of 2014 2015 and 2016 and we expect it to remain under pressure in the future 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry have generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment however us dollardenominated adrs declined in 2016 due to the currency translation impact current occupancy rates remain at record highs however us hotel supply growth has been accelerating which may put additional pressure on adrs in international markets hotel supply is being added at a faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as china and india among others companies like airbnb have also added incremental global supply in the alternative accommodations space in addition while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups in the meantime certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on thirdparty websites as well as incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with over 350000 properties on our global websites as of december 31 2016 including certain homeaway vacation rental properties now available on other expedia inc sites in addition our room night growth has been healthy with room nights excluding elong growing 24 in 2014 36 in 2015 and 21 in 2016 adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites excluding elong increased 3 in 2014 declined 5 in 2015 and declined 1 in 2016 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2016 hotel accounted for 61 

homeaway 

with our acquisition of homeaway and all of its brands in december 2015 we have expanded into the fast growing 100 billion alternative accommodations market homeaway is a leader in this market and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia homeaway has been undergoing a transition from a listingsbased classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology in addition homeaway rolled out a traveler service fee in the united states and europe during the first half of 2016 consistent with market practice the fee is expected to continue to contribute to homeaway’s revenue growth and help fund marketing investment programs to better protect travelers and future growth initiatives furthermore homeaway moved to a single subscription option globally in july 2016 as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2016 homeaway accounted for   8 

air 

significant airline sector consolidation in the united states in recent years has generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares which combined with the significant declines in fuel prices led to record levels of profitability for the us air carriers further strengthening their position however in 2015 and 2016 there has been evidence of discounting by the us carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results ticket prices on expedia sites excluding elong declined 11 in 2015 and 6 in 2016 as shorthaul traffic and low cost carriers grew alongside 

increasingly competitive airline pricing we continue to encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine and as certain supply agreements renew 

air ticket volumes excluding elong increased 35 in 2015 and 32 in 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of orbitz as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2016 air accounted for 9 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch site in addition to expedia media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2016 we generated a total of 807 million of advertising and media revenue representing 9 of our total worldwide revenue up from 564 million excluding elong in 2015 

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades each expedia technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and help customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched new global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands in 2013 expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded sites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas the shift of travelocitybranded sites to the expedia technology platform was successfully completed over the course of 2014 in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently converted the wotifcom site to the expedia platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated in september 2015 expedia completed the acquisition of orbitz worldwide including all of its brands the migration of the orbitzcom cheapticketscom and ebookers sites to the expedia technology platform was completed in the first half of 2016 and orbitz for business customers were migrated to the egencia technology platform as of july 2016 in december 2015 expedia completed the acquisition of homeaway inc including all of its brands we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers in addition while we aim to drive the topline growth in our global brands we are managing our regional brands such as travelocity orbitzcom wotifcom ebookers and cheapticketscom with a greater focus on profitability

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of auto escape group one of europe’s leading online car rental reservation companies auto escape group has joined with the carrentalscom brand allowing it to expand internationally to provide our customers more choices across the globe and help our supply partners expand their marketing reach 

in november 2014 we completed the acquisition of wotif group an australian online travel company wotif group adds to our collection of travel’s most trusted brands and enhances our supply in the asiapacific region while allowing expedia to expose the wotif group to our worldclass technology and its customers to our extensive global supply 

in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre as a result of the acquisition the strategic marketing agreement previously entered into during 2013 which joined travelocity’s strong brand with our bestinclass booking platform supply base and customer service was terminated evolving this relationship strengthens expedia inc’s ability to continue to innovate and deliver the best travel experiences to the widest set of travelers all over the world 

in march 2015 we completed the acquisition of an additional 25 equity interest of aae travel pte ltd the joint venture formed between expedia and airasia berhad in 2011 this investment increases our total ownership in the venture to 75 and we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy following the close of the transaction in march 2015 the financial results of the airasia expedia venture are included in expedia’s consolidated financial statements 

in march 2015 expedia and decolarcom inc the latin american online travel company that operates the decolarcom and despegarcom branded websites announced that the two companies have expanded their partnership to include deeper cooperation on hotel supply and a minority equity investment by expedia building on the commercial relationship the two companies have had since 2002 the expanded agreement broadens expedia’s powering of decolar’s hotel supply and introduces the opportunity for decolar to provide expedia access to its hotel supply in latin america the customers of both companies will benefit from the broad shared selection of hotels and hotel partners will gain increased access to travelers in latin america and around the world 

in september 2015 we completed the acquisition of orbitz worldwide a leading global portfolio of travel brands and businesstobusiness offerings the addition of orbitz worldwide brings expedia an attractive set of wellrecognized brands built by a talented team that is passionate about travel 

in december 2015 we completed the acquisition of homeaway which operates an online marketplace for the vacation rental industry with sites representing over one million online bookable listings of vacation rental homes in over 190 countries with expedia’s expertise in powering global transactional platforms and our industryleading technology capabilities we are partnering with our homeaway brand to accelerate their shift from a classified marketplace to an online transactional model to create even better experiences for homeaway’s global traveler audience and the owners and managers of its properties around the world 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion 

new channel penetration  technological innovations and developments continue to create new opportunities for travel bookings made through mobile devices in addition to more traditional methods like desktop and laptop computers in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends and some of our brands now see more traffic via mobile devices than via traditional desktops mobile bookings via smartphones continue to present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we had historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods in addition we are seeing increasing crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during the year ended december 31 2016  nearly one in three expedia inc transactions were booked globally on a mobile device

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and winter holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel products including merchant and agency hotel is recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago are experienced in the second half of the year as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we aggressively market during the busy booking period for spring summer and winter holiday travel additionally trivago has historically earned a substantial portion of its operating profits in the fourth quarter as a result on a consolidated basis revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations advertising business or a change in our product mix including the assimilation and growth of homeaway may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future we expect that as 

homeaway continues its shift to more of a transactionbased business model for vacation rental listings its seasonal trends will generally trend similar to our other traditional leisure businesses over time 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom rewards program our brand expedia expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on over 30 brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks sm  the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions the cost of these loyalty points is recorded as a reduction to revenue in our consolidated financial statements we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

business combinations 

we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if so we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise periodically we may choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and perform quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we 

determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy and other taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques including the blackscholes and monte carlo optionpricing models we amortize the fair value over the remaining term on a straightline basis we account for forfeitures as they occur the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

in addition we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in twenty lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 71 million  as of december 31 2016 and 43 million  as of december 31 2015 

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina minnesota oregon rhode island and maryland the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including to the states of new york south carolina north carolina minnesota georgia wyoming oregon rhode island montana and maryland the district of columbia and the city of new york as well as certain other county and local jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously 

hawaii general excise tax  during 2013 the expedia companies were required to “paytoplay” and paid a total of 171 million in advance of litigation relating to general excise taxes for merchant model hotel reservations in the state of hawaii in september 2015 following a ruling by the hawaii supreme court the state of hawaii refunded the expedia companies 132 million of the original “paytoplay” amount as we had previously expensed the paytoplay payments in prior periods we recognized a gain in legal reserves occupancy tax and other during the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter orbitz also received a similar refund of 22 million from the state of hawaii in september 2015 the amount paid net of refunds by the expedia companies and orbitz to the state of hawaii in satisfaction of past general excise taxes on their services for merchant model hotel reservations was 44 million the parties reached a settlement relating to orbitz merchant model hotel tax liabilities and on october 5 2016 the expedia companies paid the state of hawaii for the tax years 2012 through 2015 the expedia companies and orbitz have now resolved all assessments by the state of hawaii for merchant model hotel taxes through 2015 

the department of taxation also issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies including orbitz dated december 23 2015 for the time period 2000 to 2014 for hotel and car rental revenue for “agency model” transactions those assessments are currently under review in the hawaii tax courts 

final assessments by the hawaii department of taxation for general exercise taxes against the expedia companies including orbitz relating to merchant car rental transactions during the years 2000 to 2014 are also under review in the hawaii tax courts with respect to merchant model car rental transactions at issue for the tax years 2000 through 2013 the hawaii tax court held on august 5 2016 that general excise tax is due on the online travel companies’ services to facilitate car rentals the court further ruled that for merchant model car rentals in hawaii the online travel companies are required to pay general excise tax on the total amount paid by consumers with no credit for tax amounts already remitted by car rental companies to the state of hawaii for tax years 2000 through 2013 thus resulting in a double tax on the amount paid by consumers to car rental companies for the rental of the vehicle the court however ruled that when car rentals are paid for as part of a vacation package tax is only due once on the amount paid by consumers to the car rental company for the rental of the vehicle in addition the court ruled that the online travel companies are required to pay interest and certain penalties on the amounts due the expedia companies intend to appeal and will be expected to pay under protest the full amount claimed due or approximately 165 million as a condition of appeal the hawaii tax court’s decision did not resolve “merchant model” car rental transactions for the tax year 2014 which also remain under review 

san francisco  during 2009 we were required to “paytoplay” and paid 48 million in advance of litigation relating to occupancy tax proceedings with the city of san francisco the city of san francisco subsequently issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the online travel companies including against certain expedia companies the additional assessments including the prepayment of such assessments were contested by the expedia companies on the basis that the court has already ruled that taxes are not due from the online travel companies and that binding precedent by the california court of appeals precludes the city’s claim for taxes on may 14 2014 the court heard oral argument on the expedia companies’ contest of the prepayment requirement for the additional assessments and held that the expedia companies were required to prepay in order to litigate the legality of the assessments on may 26 2014 the expedia companies paid 255 million under protest in order to contest the additional assessments the additional assessments were expensed during the second quarter of 2014 in addition orbitz in total has paid 46 million to the city of san francisco in prepayment of taxes to contest these assessments issued against it by the city on august 6 2014 the california court of appeals stayed this case pending review and decision by the california supreme court of the city of san diego california litigation the stay is now lifted and the appeal will proceed in light of the california supreme court’s decision in the san diego  litigation 

other jurisdictions  we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities some of which including in the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax “vat” to our european union related transactions impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

segments 

we have four reportable segments core ota trivago egencia and homeaway upon its acquisition on december 15 2015 in addition elong was a reportable segment through its disposal on may 22 2015 our core ota segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world orbitzcom expedia affiliate network hotwirecom travelocity wotif group carrentalscom and classic vacations our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites our egencia segment which also includes orbitz for business provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide our homeaway segment operates an online marketplace for the vacation rental industry 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 



 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily driven by the inorganic impact from acquisitions of 13 and growth in the core ota segment including growth at brand expedia and hotelscom as well as in egencia the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily driven by growth in the core ota segment including strong performance at brand expedia and hotelscom acquisitions added approximately 10 of inorganic gross bookings growth for 2015  excluding travelocity due to the previously implemented commercial agreement 

revenue margin increased in 2016  as compared to 2015  primarily due to the inclusion of homeaway revenue without the additional gross bookings as well as the f avorable impact of lower air ticket prices and a mix shift to higher margin products 

including advertising and media revenue these impacts were partially offset by the inclusion of a higher share of lower margin air gross bookings with the acquisition of orbitz and lower revenue per room night revenue margin decreased in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower revenue per room night these impacts were partially offset by a favorable impact of lower air ticket prices and a mix shift to higher margin products including advertising and media revenue 

results of operations 

on may 22 2015 we completed the sale of our 624 ownership stake in elong the below discussion of the results of operations for 2015 include results for elong through its disposal on may 22 2015 operating expense tables below present total expenses including elong for the prior year periods as well as elong specific amounts included within the consolidated total

revenue 



in 2016  revenue increased primarily driven by 19 of inorganic impact from acquisitions growth in the core ota segment including growth at brand expedia and hotelscom as well as growth at trivago in 2015  revenue increased primarily due to growth in the core ota segment including strong performance at brand expedia hotelscom and ean as well as growth at trivago partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the sale of elong acquisitions added approximately 8 to the yearoveryear growth rate in total revenue for 2015

worldwide air revenue increased 37 39 excluding elong in 2016  due to a 29 32 excluding elong increase in air tickets sold and a 6 5 excluding elong increase in revenue per air ticket driven by new contractual agreements and the addition of orbitz acquisitions added approximately 28 of inorganic air revenue growth in 2016  and 21 of air ticket 

growth worldwide air revenue increased 21 25 excluding elong in 2015  due to a 28 35 excluding elong increase in air tickets sold partially offset by a 6 7 excluding elong decrease in revenue per air ticket acquisitions added approximately 18 of inorganic air revenue growth in 2015  and 15 of air ticket growth 

the remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services fees related to our corporate travel business and homeaway revenue increased by 79 in 2016  and   19 in 2015  primarily due to the acquisition of homeaway and strong growth in advertising and media revenue as well as growth in our travel insurance and car rental products including an inorganic contribution from orbitz 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 



  

 the increase in merchant revenue in 2016  and 2015  was primarily due to the increase in merchant hotel revenue driven by an increase in room nights stayed the increase in agency revenue in 2016  and 2015  was primarily due to the growth in agency hotel and air the increase in advertising and media revenue in 2016  and 2015  was primarily due to continued growth in trivago and expedia media solutions

legal reserves occupancy tax and other consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2016  we recognized approximately 12 million for amounts expected to be paid in advance of litigation related to merchant model” car rental transactions in connection with hawaiis general excise tax litigation the remaining expense in 2016 related to changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes 

during 2015  we received a refund of prepaid paytoplay payments of 132 million from the state of hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation in addition during 2015  we recorded a 24 million benefit in legal reserves occupancy tax and other for the recovery of costs related to occupancy tax litigation matters these gains were partially offset by charges for changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes 

during 2014  we recognized approximately 255 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the san francisco occupancy tax proceedings 

for additional information see note 17 — commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and related reorganization charges 

in connection with the migration of technology platforms and centralization of technology supply and other operations primarily related to previously disclosed acquisitions we recognized 56 million  105 million and 26 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2016  2015  and 2014  in 2016 and 2015 the charges were primarily related to employee severance and benefits as a part of the orbitz integration and represents estimated severance amounts under preexisting written plans and contracts orbitz had with its employees stockcompensation charges for acceleration of replacement awards pursuant to certain of these agreements as well as incremental retention compensation for exiting employees in 2014  the charges primarily related to severance and related benefits as well as an australian stamp duty tax that was payable to certain australian jurisdictions related to business restructuring events based on current plans which are subject to change we expect to incur approximately 10  to 15 million  in 2017 related to these integrations and estimates do not include any possible future acquisition integrations 

for additional information see note 15 — restructuring and related reorganization charges  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating income 



in 2016  operating income increased primarily due to higher growth in revenue and the absence of elong operating losses partially offset by increased costs and expenses including growth in technology and content expense in excess of revenue growth higher amortization of intangible assets as well as the comparative impact of the prior year hawaii paytoplay gain of 132 million 

in 2015  operating income decreased due to increased costs and expenses including growth in selling and marketing expense in excess of revenue growth growth in general and administrative expense in excess of revenue growth as well as an increase in restructuring and related reorganization charges partially offset by the gain of 132 million related to the hawaii paytoplay refunds 

included in our consolidated operating income for 2015  are operating losses for elong through its disposition date of may 22 2015 of 86 million elong had operating losses of 51 million for 2014  

interest income and expense 



interest income increased in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher rates of return partially offset by lower invested balances interest income decreased in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower invested balances as well as lower rates of return due to a shift out of higheryielding currencies due to the sale of elong and funding us dollar denominated acquisitions and lower market rates in certain currencies 

interest expense increased in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of additional interest on the euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes issued in june 2015 and the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in december 2015   interest expense increased in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of additional interest on the 500 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2014 the euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes issued in june 2015 as well as the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in december 2015 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our longterm indebtedness totaled 32 billion  as of december 31 2014  our longterm indebtedness totaled 17 billion 

gain on sale of business 

on may 22 2015 we completed the sale of our 624 ownership stake in elong inc for approximately 671 million or 666 million net of costs to sell and other transaction expenses to several purchasers including ctripcom international ltd as a result of the sale we recognized a pretax gain of 509 million 395 million after tax during 2015 included in gain on sale of business in our consolidated statement of operations 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 



provision for income taxes   

the decrease in our effective rate for 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to tax benefits from the adoption of new accounting guidance relating to stockbased compensation and the release of valuation allowances in the united kingdom and germany on cumulative foreign net operating losses for which it is more likely than not the tax benefit will be realized as a result of lower pretax earnings in 2016 the impacts of these benefits create a significant effect on our effective tax rate   our effective tax rate for 2016  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the 

united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower as well as the same factors impacting the yearoveryear effective tax rate comparison 

the increase in the effective rate for 2015  compared to 2014  is primarily due to the gain on the sale of elong during 2015  and the release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in 2014  our effective tax rate for 2015  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states as well as the sale of elong which had a us effective rate of less than 35 

our effective tax rate for 2014  was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states as well as the release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 

for additional information see note 11 — income taxes   in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 19 billion  and 17 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  including 11 billion and 645 million of cash and shortterm investment balances held in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries which includes 737 million and 441 million related to earnings indefinitely invested outside the united states as well as 313 million and 72 million held in majorityowned subsidiaries which is also indefinitely invested outside the united states and our 15 billion revolving credit facility which is essentially untapped cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states totaled 18 billion  as of december 31 2016  to date we have permanently reinvested the majority of these foreign earnings outside of the united states and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to us income taxes 

the revolving credit facility which was amended in the first quarter of 2016 to increase borrowing capacity to 15 billion extend the expiration to february 2021 and provide more favorable fees as disclosed herein bears interest based on the company’s credit ratings with the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts was libor plus 1375 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts was 175 basis points as of december 31 2016 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2016  moody’s rating was ba1 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt which was comprised of 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2018 that bear interest at 7456 the “7456 notes” 750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 595 the “595 notes” 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 45 the “45 notes” euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in june 2022 that bear interest at 25 the 25 notes and 750 million of registered senior unsecured notes due in february 2026 that bear interest at 50 the 50 notes 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel advertising or certain expedia affiliate network relationships or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers such as with mobile bookings via smartphones our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by the transition of our recent homeaway acquisition’s shift to more of a transactional model from a subscription model 

as our etp program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling up of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow relative liquidity during the transition and hotel revenue margins 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp as well as the assimilation and transformation of the homeaway vacation rental listing business may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2016  we had a deficit in our working capital of 27 billion  compared to a deficit of 29 billion as of december 31 2015 the slight change in deficit is primarily due to operating cash flows offset by financing and investing activities including capital expenditures and share repurchases 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements in infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts in addition in 2016 we began our expansion into the cloud computing environment while we expect our cloud computing expenses to increase significantly over the next few years they are expected to result in lower overall capital expenditures related to our data centers over time   our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt excluding capital expenditures associated with the build out of our new corporate headquarters we expect total capital expenditures for 2017 to decline slightly over 2016  spending levels our current estimates for the new headquarters total approximately 650 million of which approximately 30 million was spent in 2016 and less than 100 million will be spent in 2017 the remainder will be split roughly evenly between 2018 and 2019 

our cash flows are as follows 



in 2016  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 196 million  primarily due to   higher operating income after adjusting for impacts of depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in benefits from working capital adjustments and a net refund of hotel occupancy and other taxes in 2015 in 2015  net cash provided by operating activities remained essentially flat as a net refund of hotel occupancy and other taxes was mostly offset by decreased benefits from working capital changes including increases in income tax and interest payments 

in 2016  cash used in investing activities decreased by 17 billion  primarily due to a decrease of cash used for acquisitions of 21 billion partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds related to the sale of elong of 457 million in the prior year in 2015  cash used in investing activities increased by 14 billion primarily due to an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 15 billion due primarily to our acquisition of orbitz in september 2015 and homeaway in december 2015  as well as higher capital expenditures of 460 million including amounts paid for our new corporate headquarters partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of elong of 524 million 

cash used in financing activities in 2016  primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 456 million including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below the repayment of 401 million of homeaway convertible notes and 150 million cash dividend payment partially offset by 215 million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of trivago as well as 141 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans cash provided by financing activities in 2015  primarily included 700 million of net proceeds for the issuance of 25 notes in june 2015 741 

million in net proceeds for the issuance of the 50 notes in december 2015 120 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock and 91 million in excess tax benefit on equity awards of which approximately 47 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our chairman and senior executive these financing inflows were offset in part by 85 million of withholding taxes for stock option exercises paid on behalf of our chairman and senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled as well as cash paid to acquire shares of 61 million primarily under the repurchase authorizations discussed below and 109 million cash dividend payments cash provided by financing activities in 2014 primarily included 493 million of net proceeds for the issuance of 45 notes in august 2014 and 129 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 538 million including the repurchased shares under the 2012 authorization discussed below and 85 million cash dividend payment 

during 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during each of the respective years and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 70 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 



  

 as of december 31 2016  73 million  shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2015 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases subsequent to december 31 2016  we repurchased an additional 03 million shares for a total cost of 30 million excluding transaction costs representing an average price of 11342 per share 

our common stock dividend was 100  per share for 2016  084 per share for 2015  and 066 per share for 2014  see note 13 — stockholders’ equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition in february 2017 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 028  per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 30 2017  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 9 2017  future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2016  showed a net change of 92 million reflecting lower depreciations in foreign currencies in 2016  compared to 2015  the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2015  showed a net change of 18 million reflecting higher depreciation in foreign currencies in the 2015  compared to 2014  

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

 part ii item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes 595 notes 25 notes 45 notes and 50 notes were approximately 541 million  823 million  718 million  511 million  and 782 million  as of december 31 2016  as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 4 million our 595 notes by approximately 13 million our 45 notes by approximately 16 million our 25 notes by approximately 17 million and our 50 notes by approximately 28 million 

we maintain a 15 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we invest in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2016  we had 64 million  of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in bond prices would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of less than 1 million as of december 31 2016  such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  or 2014  

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2016  we had a net forward liability of 4 million  included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of december 31 2015  we had a net forward asset of 8 million  included in prepaid expenses and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 21 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2016  as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 15 million 30 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 25 million 15 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 6 million 14 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

growth strategy

canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas the shift of travelocitybranded sites to the expedia technology platform was successfully completed over the course of 2014 in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently converted the wotifcom site to the expedia platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated in september 2015 expedia completed the acquisition of orbitz worldwide including all of its brands in december 2015 expedia completed the acquisition of homeaway inc including all of its brands we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of auto escape group one of europe’s leading online car rental reservation companies auto escape group has joined with the carrentalscom brand allowing it to expand internationally to provide our customers more choices across the globe and help our supply partners expand their marketing reach 

in november 2014 we completed the acquisition of wotif group an australian online travel company wotif group adds to our collection of travel’s most trusted brands and enhances our supply in the asiapacific region while allowing expedia to expose the wotif group to our worldclass technology and its customers to our extensive global supply 

in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre as a result of the acquisition the strategic marketing agreement previously entered into during 2013 which joined travelocity’s strong brand with our bestinclass booking platform supply base and customer service was terminated evolving this relationship strengthens expedia inc’s ability to continue to innovate and deliver the best travel experiences to the widest set of travelers all over the world 

in march 2015 we acquired a controlling interest in a joint venture with airasia a low cost carrier serving the asiapacific region as a result of the purchase of an additional 25 equity interest in the joint venture we formed with them in july 2011 brand expedia partners with lowcost airline airasia™ allowing expedia sites to be an official third party online distribution channel for airasia content this investment increased our total ownership in the venture to 75 and we consider this business to be a key part of our asiapacific strategy following the close of the transaction in march 2015 the financial results of the airasiaexpedia venture are included in expedia’s consolidated financial statements

in september 2015 we completed the acquisition of orbitz worldwide a leading global portfolio of travel brands and businesstobusiness offerings the addition of orbitz worldwide brings expedia an attractive set of wellrecognized brands built by a talented team that is passionate about travel 

in december 2015 we completed the acquisition of homeaway which operates an online marketplace for the vacation rental industry with sites representing over one million paid listings of vacation rental homes in over 190 countries with expedia’s expertise in powering global transactional platforms and our industryleading technology capabilities we look forward to partnering with homeaway to accelerate their shift from a classified marketplace to an online transactional model to create even better experiences for homeaway’s global traveler audience and the owners and managers of its properties around the world 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion 

new channel penetration  today the majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we believe mobile bookings via smartphones present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last few years customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop in addition we are seeing increasing crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe in the future mobile is likely to represent an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during the year ended december 31 2015 one in four expedia inc transactions were booked globally on a mobile device 

business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through the following business models the merchant model the agency model and the advertising model in addition upon our acquisition of homeaway on december 15 2015 we also earn revenue related to subscriptionbased vacation rental listing and other ancillary services provided to property owners and managers 

under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings the majority of our 

  

merchant transactions relate to hotel bookings under the agency model we facilitate travel bookings and act as the agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier andor traveler 

we continue to see closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant product through our expedia traveler preference etp program by offering for participating hotels customers the choice of whether to pay expedia in advance under our merchant program expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect growth in our etp program has generally resulted in reduced negotiated economics to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs and as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions based on these dynamics we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through various of our expediabranded and other websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

under the advertising model we offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transactionbased websites 

our homeaway brand offers subscriptionbased vacation rental listing products and services to property owners or managers where property owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term typically one year and on a transactionbasis where a commission is earned on traveler bookings completed on our websites going forward we expect to transition over time to more transactionbased service offerings including the introduction of a consumer booking fee 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines destination service providers and with the closing of the homeaway acquisition property owners and managers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload 

  

information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed via a proprietary extranet 

in addition homeaway’s vacation rental listing services includes a set of tools for property owners or managers which enables them to manage an availability calendar reservations inquiries and the content of the listing as well as provide various other services for property owners or managers to manage reservations or drive incremental sales volume 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers to our sites 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media sites offline advertising loyalty programs mobile apps and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include hotelscom rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia ®  rewards on over 25 brand expedia points of sale as well as orbitz rewards on orbitzcom the cost of these loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom hotelscom hotwire travelocity homeaway wotif lastminutecomau and venerebranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia hotelscom or homeaway cobranded offering or a private label website our ean and orbitz partner network businesses provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

operations and technology 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador egypt and india we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

  

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have 24hour monitoring and engineering support as well as in the public cloud these data centers have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe international markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

additionally we are subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry some of these laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our various business models

travel suppliers some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as favorable rates increased or exclusive product availability complimentary wifi and their own bonus miles or loyalty points or in the case of airlines promote hotel supply at their websites which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

search engines we also face increasing competition from search engines including google to the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning shopping or booking capabilities or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites or offer the ability to transact on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities comparable to otas to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our websites or websites in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivagobranded websites compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases than us we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch engines travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of priceline trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia tripadvisor and qunar a subsidiary of ctrip aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some 

  

metasearch sites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize the metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example during 2015 tripadvisor continued to expand its instant book feature that allows visitors to book directly on the tripadvisor website which could have a negative impact on our unit volume growth in the future in addition as a result of our acquisition of a majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise trivago’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile platform travel applications mobile platforms including smartphones and tablet computers have rapidly emerged and continue to grow significantly the emergence and improved functionality of mobile platforms has led to an increased use by consumers of standalone applications to research and book travel if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

social media websites social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition 

alternative accommodations airbnb and similar websites that facilitate the shortterm rental of homes and apartments from owners provide an alternative to hotel rooms and vacation rental properties available through expedia websites including homeaway which was acquired by expedia on december 15 2015 the continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for our services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and vacation rentals 

other participants in the travel industry traditional consumer ecommerce websites and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites to the extent such websites continue to expand these services over time it may create additional competition in addition car rideshare services such as uber increasingly compete with the traditional car rental services that we offer on our retail websites and to our corporate clients which may negatively affect our carbased and corporate travel businesses 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

  

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in evolving channels such as metasearch and mobile as well as offering new consumer choices including inventory types and transactional models and increasing supplier inventory on our existing platforms through acquisitions and partnerships if we fail to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments our business could be adversely affected our attempts to adapt our current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives inadequate return on investments difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto our platforms as well as limiting our ability to develop new site innovations in addition adaptations to our business may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs and increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers in addition these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch engines including kayak and tripadvisor pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place lower in search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates or those of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent in addition certain metasearch companies have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites to the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers gds partners and owners and managers of vacation rental properties a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm hotel and airline contracts 

no assurances can be given that our compensation access to inventory or access to inventory at competitive rates will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future or that travel suppliers will not reduce average daily rates “adrs” attempt to implement costly direct connections charge us for or otherwise restrict access to content increase credit card fees or fees for other services fail to provide us with accurate booking 

  

information or otherwise take actions that would increase our operating expenses any of actions or other similar actions could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including increased spending from our competitors promotional and discounting activities the increasing costs of our growing customer loyalty programs the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among our multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative travelrelated traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines during 2015 certain online travel companies and metasearch sites continued to expand their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in emerging markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings the emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies for such platforms have and will continue to require new and costly investments in technology we may not be successful or we may be less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as a service provider could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits 

  

we are also in the early stages of a multiyear effort to increase our utilization of cloud computing services implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site innovations in addition during the migration process the sites have in the past and may continue in the future to experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems or enhancements to existing infrastructure technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

for example during 2015 we expended significant resources in acquiring investing or otherwise entering into significant commercial arrangements with a number of companies including orbitz worldwide inc decolarcom inc and homeaway inc and certain assets of travelocitycom lp 

in connection with our acquisition of homeaway we are subject to legal financial and competitive risk associated with homeaway’s transition to a primarily transactionbased business homeaway historically has generated revenues primarily when owners or managers of vacation rentals pay homeaway subscription fees for the listing of their properties on the homeaway family of sites while subscription fees are the predominant source of revenue for homeaway today a minority of homeaway’s revenue is generated from a commissionbased business model where the owner or manager of the property pays homeaway a commission on a transactional basis for each booking of the property by a traveler and the traveler pays a service fee for the use of the homeaway platform homeaway has announced its intention to transition to a business model where the primary source of its revenues would be generated on a per booking basis by instituting a service fee to the traveler each time a property is booked and expanding its practice of charging a commission to the owner or manager of such property in connection with such booking this transition involves significant additional risks and potential costs for homeaway including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 these risks could have a material adverse effect on homeaway’s business and results of operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on expedia’s operations and financial results 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

a large portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue has increased from 39 in 2010 to 44 in 2015 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we enter countries and markets that are new to us we must tailor our services and business models to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

we also earn an increasing portion of our income and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions as a result any repatriation of funds currently held by our subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions may result in a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 the china travel market in particular is significant and has grown significantly in recent years prior to may 2015 we conducted our operations in china primarily through our majority ownership interest in elong inc a leading online travel service provider in china following the sale of our elong ownership stake in may 2015 to a group of chinabased purchasers including to a subsidiary of ctrip international ltd we have conducted our business in china through localized websites and commercial arrangements with local partners including ctrip there can be no guarantee that we will be able to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in china and our failure to do so could significantly impact our ability to grow our overall business 

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel and vacation rental licensing and listing requirements the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security and privacy as a result regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic and trade regulations and anticorruption laws across industries us trade sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries including cuba iran sudan and syria and nationals and others of those countries as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities we believe that our activities comply with ofac trade regulations and anticorruption regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the uk bribery act as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our 

  

programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands 

we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and in particular parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia described in part i item 3 legal proceedings – hotel booking practices proceedings and litigation the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

in addition homeaway has been and continues to be subject to regulatory development that affect the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like us to list those vacation rentals online for example some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or otherwise limit their ability to do so and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations some states and local jurisdictions also have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented which they assert apply to vacation rentals many homeowners condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict shortterm vacation rentals in addition many of the fundamental statutes and ordinances that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce which creates a risk of these laws being used in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

furthermore our future growth may be limited by antitrust or competition laws for example our business has grown and continues to expand and as a consequence increases in our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of various domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities these taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues this has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities as such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax reserves or may require us to modify our business practices to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy or other taxes including but not limited to the legal 

  

proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple european union jurisdictions regarding the application of value added tax to our european union transactions while we believe we comply with applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity which payments may be substantial this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes for example as a precondition to challenging the assessments on january 9 2015 we paid 23 million under protest to the city of portland oregon and multnomah county oregon during 2009 we paid 48 million under protest to the city of san francisco and an additional 255 million under protest on may 26 2014 in connection with additional assessments and during 2013 we paid 171 million to the state of hawaii the state of hawaii has also issued additional assessments for general excise tax penalties and interest against expedia hotelscom and hotwire including an assessment of 205 million for 2012 tax year noncommissioned hotel reservations an assessment of 292 million including a duplicative assessments for tax years 2000 through 2012 noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars and an assessment of 285 million for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel reservations and car rental for the tax year 2013 and for which we have requested additional support from the state of hawaii but have not received any response to date 

significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges including the amount of or basis for such charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

amendment to existing tax laws rules or regulations or enactment of new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

many of the underlying laws rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax or other laws rules or regulations were amended or if new unfavorable laws rules or regulations were enacted particularly with respect to occupancy sales valueadded taxes or unclaimed property the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively subject us to interest and penalties decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions as a result these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

in addition in the past us and foreign governments have introduced proposals for tax legislation or have adopted tax laws that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate or increase our tax liabilities the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example in october 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released a final package of measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to “base erosion and profit shifting” “beps” by multinational companies multiple member jurisdictions including the united states have begun implementing recommended changes such as proposed country by country reporting beginning as early as 2016 additional multilateral changes are anticipated in upcoming years any changes to national or international tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and adversely affect our profitability our effective tax rate in the future could also be adversely 

  

affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with relevant authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws and regulations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example during regional or global recessions domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slow spending on the services we provide and have a negative impact on our revenue growth additionally if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions andor significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the us dollar it can lead to a negative impact on our foreign denominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance geopolitical conflicts significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and adrs decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

we are subject to paymentsrelated and fraud risks 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity moreover there can be no assurances that the rates we pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce our revenue thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

in addition credit card networks such as visa mastercard and american express have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include the payment card industry data security standards or the pci dss under these rules we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use storage and security of card data we assess our compliance with the pci dss rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls failure to comply may subject us to fines penalties damages and civil liability and could prevent us from processing or accepting credit cards 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points we are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones and tablet computers and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

  

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we are accumulating a greater portion of our cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings would likely result in additional us income tax expense in addition we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see growth in both our merchant expedia collect and our agency hotel collect hotel products to the extent our merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline it would likely result in pressure on our working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity moreover we expended significant resources in 2015 in acquiring and investing in a number of companies including orbitz worldwide inc decolarcom inc and homeaway inc “homeaway” and certain assets of travelocitycom lp and we may be obligated to expend significant additional resources in 2016 in connection with certain “put” rights associated with our majority investment in trivago which rights are exercisable by trivago’s current shareholders in 2016 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service fitch or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

  

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on information technology systems including the internet and thirdparty hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data including booking transactions intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments accounting procurement and supply chain activities in addition we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent additionally as we continue to integrate our acquired companies such as orbitz into our information technology systems we may increase the risk of these system interruptions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon — including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers — and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business we devote significant resources to network security monitoring and testing employee training and other security measures but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information intellectual property proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in our operations we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to our contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users and our business partners to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for their own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

in addition no assurance can be given that our backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of our operations or business processes in all circumstances many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

  

we process store and use personal information payment card information and other consumer data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations 

we may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information payment card information and other consumer data the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information payment card information or other consumer data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in the company as well as subject us to bank fines penalties or increased transaction costs all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online in addition the european court of justice’s invalidation of the useu safe harbor framework could make it more difficult for us to transfer data outside of the european union for processing and the european union’s reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance finally countries in other regions most notably asia eastern europe and latin america are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

  

we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty interactive corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty interactive corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 54 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2015 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty interactive corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that mr diller and mr kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

  

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia affiliate network business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers on which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2015 we held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately 16 billion primarily in bank of america bnp paribas hsbc jpmorgan chase royal bank of canada and standard chartered bank and held time deposits of approximately 29 million at financial institutions including jpmorgan chase and nordea additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of approximately 71 million primarily in deutsche bank and citibank as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2015 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 19 billion the fair value of which was approximately 8 million the counterparties to these contracts were credit suisse international standard chartered bank goldman sachs bank jpmorgan chase bank of america us bank barclays bank plc bnp paribas wells fargo royal bank of canada societe generale bank of tokyomitsubishi citibank and hsbc we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts 

in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have significant indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have outstanding longterm indebtedness with a face value of 32 billion and we have a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility risks relating to our indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify

hawaii tax court litigation general excise tax  on january 31 2011 the online travel companies received final notices of assessment for general excise taxes for the tax years 2000 to 2011 on their services relating to noncommissioned hotel room reservations the companies appealed these assessments to the hawaii tax court on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that the online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on both the amount paid to the online travel companies for their services and the amount paid to the hotel for the room thus subjecting the hotel’s charge for the room to double taxation because general excise taxes on the hotel room had already been paid for all of the years at issue on march 15 2013 the hawaii tax court issued penalties against the online travel companies for their failure to file returns and pay general excise taxes on august 12 2013 the court further held that interest is due on such penalties the case proceeded directly to the hawaii supreme court for review and was not considered by the hawaii court of appeals on march 17 2015 the hawaii supreme court issued a decision on the pending appeal the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the hawaii tax court’s decision specifically the court ruled that while the online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on the amount paid to them for their services along with penalties the online travel companies are not liable for general excise taxes interest or penalties on the amount paid to the hotel for the room the department of taxation dismissed without prejudice its common law claims for the recovery of general excise taxes 

as a precondition to appealing the tax court rulings the expedia companies and orbitz were required to pay an amount equal to taxes penalties and interest this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to the taxes in question the total amount that the expedia companies paid in 2013 to appeal the tax court ruling was 171 million comprised of 78 million in taxes 41 million in penalties and 52 million in interest in light of the hawaii supreme court decision the state agreed to refund the expedia companies 132 million which was subsequently paid to expedia in september 2015 also in september 2015 orbitz received a similar refund of 22 million from the state of hawaii the amount paid net of refunds by the expedia companies and orbitz to the state of hawaii in satisfaction of past general excise taxes on their services is 44 million 

in addition the department of taxation has issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies including orbitz for i noncommissioned hotel reservations for the tax year 2012 totaling 26 million which includes 6 million for orbitz ii noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars for the tax years 2000 through 2012 totaling 39 million which includes 10 million for orbitz and a 

  

duplicative assessment for expedia and hotelscom totaling 93 million and thus are overstated and iii noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel reservations and car rental for the tax year 2013 totaling 34 million which includes 5 million for orbitz similar assessments also have been issued against other online travel companies these assessments are currently under review in tax court 

the department of taxation has issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies including orbitz dated december 23 2015 for the time period 2000 to 2014 for hotel and car rental revenue for “agency model” transactions and hotel and car rental revenue for “merchant model” transactions for 2014 these assessments total 12 million including tax interest and penalties

hotel booking practices proceedings and litigation 

on july 31 2012 the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” issued a statement of objections alleging that expedia bookingcom bv and intercontinental hotels group plc “ihg” have infringed european union and united kingdom competition law in relation to the online supply of hotel room accommodations the statement of objections alleged that expedia and bookingcom entered into separate agreements with ihg that restricted each online travel company’s ability to discount the price of ihg hotel rooms the parties proposed to address the oft’s concerns by offering commitments and on january 31 2014 the oft announced that it had formally accepted the commitments offered by the parties with no finding of fault or liability the commitments were intended to be binding on the parties through january 31 2016 on april 2 2014 skyscanner limited filed an appeal challenging the oft’s january 31 2014 decision to accept the parties’ commitments on september 26 2014 the united kingdom’s competition appeal tribunal “cat” granted skyscanner limited’s appeal this judgment required the competition  markets authority “cma” the united kingdom’s competition authority to review the decision of its predecessor body the oft the cma did not appeal the cat’s decision and subsequently announced that it is considering next steps in the investigation in light of the cat judgment and market developments including developments relating to the investigations of other european competition authorities described below on september 16 2015 the cma announced that it has closed its investigation without a finding of infringement on grounds of administrative priority and also that it is not opening a distinct new case into parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia 

in addition the directorate general for competition consumer affairs and repression of fraud the “dgccrf” a directorate of the french ministry of economy and finance with authority over unfair trading practices brought a lawsuit in france against expedia entities objecting to certain parity clauses in contracts between expedia entities and french hotels in may 2015 the french court ruled that certain of the parity provisions in certain contracts that were the subject of the lawsuit were not in compliance with french commercial law but imposed no fine and no injunction the dgccrf has appealed the decision a number of competition authorities such as those in australia austria belgium china czech republic denmark france germany greece hungary ireland italy new zealand poland sweden and switzerland have also inquired or initiated investigations into the travel industry and in particular in relation to parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies including expedia 

  

while the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits inquiries or investigations are uncertain and our circumstances are distinguishable from those of other online travel agencies subject to similar lawsuits inquiries or investigations we note in this context that on april 21 2015 the competition authorities in france italy and sweden announced a proposed set of commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve the parity clause cases brought by these authorities against it the german federal cartel office “fco” also has required another online travel company hotel reservation service “hrs” to remove certain clauses from its contracts with hotels hrs appealed this decision which the higher regional court düsseldorf rejected on january 9 2015 on december 23 2015 the fco announced that it had also required bookingcom to remove certain clauses from its contracts with german hotels bookingcom announced that it will appeal this decision in addition with effect from august 1 2015 expedia waived certain rate conditions and availability parity clauses in its agreements with its european hotel partners for a period of five years while expedia maintains that its parity clauses have always been lawful and in compliance with competition law expedia considers that this waiver is a positive step towards facilitating the closure of the open investigations into such clauses on a harmonized paneuropean basis it is not certain what the outcome will be of the competition authorities’ assessment of expedia’s announcement since expedia’s waivers were implemented the competition authorities in denmark united kingdom greece norway sweden poland and ireland have announced either the closure of their investigation against expedia or a decision not to open an investigation against expedia in each case having had regard to the changes implemented by expedia on november 6 2015 the swiss competition authority announced that it had issued a final decision finding certain parity terms existing in previous versions of agreements between swiss hotels and each of expedia bookingcom and hotel reservation service to be prohibited under swiss law the decision explicitly notes that expedia’s current contract terms with swiss hotels are not subject to this prohibition the swiss competition authority imposed no fines or other sanctions against expedia and did not find an abuse of a dominant market position by expedia 

on july 9 2015 the french national assembly adopted article 133 of the loi macron “article 133” that seeks to define the nature of the relationship between online reservation platforms and french hotels article 133 became effective on august 8 2015 expedia considers that article 133 was drafted ambiguously and can be interpreted in a way that violates both european union and french legal principles therefore expedia has initiated a complaint with the european commission relating to article 133 however following the effective date expedia has been in contact with its hotel partners in france regarding the impact of article 133

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2014 and 2015 represented years of continuing improvement for the travel industry however geopolitical conflicts significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2015 over 50 of us and european leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occur online online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of the united states and europe and are estimated to be in the range of 20 to 30 these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom which the priceline group acquired in may 2013 trivago in which expedia acquired a majority ownership interest in march 2013 as well as tripadvisor which completed its conversion to a metasearch site in june 2013 introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies in addition certain metasearch companies adopted or intend to adopt various forms of direct or assistedbooking tools the impact of which is currently uncertain furthermore we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations including direct booking functionality as well as licensing deals and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites have been expanding their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia has both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel collect hotel offerings for our hotel supply partners and we expect our use of these models to continue to evolve including through the continued expansion of our etp program which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

  

intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful unfavorable impact on our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis at the local or regional level making decisions in each market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is less favorable than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive the crowded online travel environment is now driving certain secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing consumer mind share 

in may 2015 expedia sold its 624 equity stake in elong for approximately 671 million to several purchasers including ctripcom international ltd “ctrip” expedia and ctrip also reached agreement on cooperation for certain travel products in specified geographic markets the transaction closed on may 22 2015 unless otherwise noted all discussion in the “trends” and “growth strategy” sections refers to results for expedia inc excluding elong 

lodging 

we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners have remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced and expect to continue to reduce our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth lastly currency exchange rate fluctuations have had a negative effect on unit economics due to unfavorable booktostay as well as translation impacts based on these dynamics our average revenue per room night declined in each quarter of 2013 2014 and 2015 and we expect it to remain under pressure in the future 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry have generally increased on a currencyneutral basis in a gradually improving overall travel environment however us dollardenominated adrs declined in 2015 due to the currency translation impact current occupancy rates are at record highs and there is very little new net hotel supply being added in the us lodging market with large chains focusing their development opportunities in international markets this may help us hoteliers with their objective of continuing to grow adrs and tends to lead to pressure in our negotiations and terms with hoteliers in international markets hotel supply is being added at a much faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as china and india among others many hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings on their own websites and mobile applications by offering incentives such as loyalty points increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary wifi companies like airbnb have also added incremental global supply in the alternative accommodations space we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with approximately 269000 properties and 12 million live vacation rental listings on our global websites as of december 31 2015 in addition our room night growth has been healthy with room nights excluding elong growing 16 in 2013 24 in 2014 and 36 in 2015 adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites excluding elong increased 4 in 2013 3 in 2014 and declined 5 in 2015 

air 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil including significant air carrier consolidation in the united states which has generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares 

  

as the demand for travel continued to increase in 2014 and 2015 air carriers kept capacity growth relatively low the significant decline in fuel prices that started in the second half of 2014 did not immediately translate into reduced air fares resulting in record levels of profitability for the us air carriers further strengthening their position however in 2015 there has been evidence of discounting by the us carriers while currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic trends put pressure on international results ticket prices on expedia sites excluding elong increased 2 in 2013 declined 1 in 2014 and declined 11 in 2015 as shorthaul traffic and low cost carriers grew alongside increasingly competitive airline pricing we continue to encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine and as certain supply agreements renew 

air ticket volumes excluding elong increased 35 in 2015 primarily due to strong growth on brand expedia sites and the acquisition of orbitz air volumes improved 30 in 2014 primarily due to volume driven by brand expedia’s marketing agreement with travelocity along with ongoing improvements for the brand expedia sites themselves 

from a product perspective in 2015 69 of our revenue came from the booking of hotel reservations with 8 of our revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we believe that the hotel product is the most profitable of the travel products we distribute and represents our best overall growth opportunity 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch site in addition to expedia media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2015 we generated a total of 564 million of advertising and media revenue excluding elong representing 9 of total revenue in 2015 up from 469 million in 2014 

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades each expedia technology platform is operated by a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and help customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched new global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands in 2013 expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded sites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas the shift of travelocitybranded sites to the expedia technology platform was successfully completed over the course of 2014 in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently converted the wotifcom site to the expedia platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated in september 2015 expedia completed the acquisition of orbitz worldwide including all of its brands in december 2015 expedia completed the acquisition of homeaway inc including all of its brands we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in southern europe wotif group which has sites in australia and new zealand and ebookers which operates in a number of international countries 

  

egencia our corporate travel business operates in 65 countries around the world and continues to expand including its 2012 acquisition of via travel the homeaway portfolio has vacation rental sites all around the world we own a majority share of trivago a leading hotel metasearch company officially launched in 2005 trivago is one of the best known travel brands in europe and north america trivago continues to operate independently and rapidly grow revenue through global expansion including aggressive expansion in new countries in addition we have commercial agreements in place with ctrip and elong in china as well as decolarcom inc in latin america in 2015 approximately 37 of our worldwide gross bookings excluding elong and 44 of worldwide revenue were through international points of sale compared to just 21 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a goal of generating at least 65 of our revenue through businesses and points of sale outside of the united states 

in july 2014 we completed the acquisition of auto escape group one of europe’s leading online car rental reservation companies auto escape group has joined with the carrentalscom brand allowing it to expand internationally to provide our customers more choices across the globe and help our supply partners expand their marketing reach 

in november 2014 we completed the acquisition of wotif group an australian online travel company wotif group adds to our collection of travel’s most trusted brands and enhances our supply in the asiapacific region while allowing expedia to expose the wotif group to our worldclass technology and its customers to our extensive global supply 

in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre as a result of the acquisition the strategic marketing agreement previously entered into during 2013 which joined travelocity’s strong brand with our bestinclass booking platform supply base and customer service was terminated evolving this relationship strengthens expedia inc’s ability to continue to innovate and deliver the best travel experiences to the widest set of travelers all over the world 

in march 2015 we completed the acquisition of an additional 25 equity interest of aae travel pte ltd the joint venture formed between expedia and airasia berhad in 2011 this investment increases our total ownership in the venture to 75 and we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy following the close of the transaction in march 2015 the financial results of the airasiaexpedia venture are included in expedia’s consolidated financial statements 

in march 2015 expedia and decolarcom inc the latin american online travel company that operates the decolarcom and despegarcom branded websites announced that the two companies have expanded their partnership to include deeper cooperation on hotel supply and a minority equity investment by expedia building on the commercial relationship the two companies have had since 2002 the expanded agreement broadens expedia’s powering of decolar’s hotel supply and introduces the opportunity for decolar to provide expedia access to its hotel supply in latin america the customers of both companies will benefit from the broad shared selection of hotels and hotel partners will gain increased access to travelers in latin america and around the world 

in september 2015 we completed the acquisition of orbitz worldwide a leading global portfolio of travel brands and businesstobusiness offerings the addition of orbitz worldwide brings expedia an attractive set of wellrecognized brands built by a talented team that is passionate about travel 

in december 2015 we completed the acquisition of homeaway which operates an online marketplace for the vacation rental industry with sites representing over one million paid listings of vacation rental homes in over 190 countries with expedia’s expertise in powering global transactional platforms and our industryleading technology capabilities we look forward to partnering with homeaway to accelerate their shift from a classified marketplace to an online transactional model to create even better experiences for homeaway’s global traveler audience and the owners and managers of its properties around the world 

  

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements in conversion 

new channel penetration  today the majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we believe mobile bookings via smartphones present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last few years customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop in addition we are seeing increasing crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe in the future mobile is likely to represent an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during the year ended december 31 2015 one in four expedia inc transactions were booked globally on a mobile device 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel products including merchant and agency hotel is recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago are experienced in the second half of the year as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we aggressively market during the busy booking period for summer travel as a result revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix including the assimilation growth and shift to more of a transactionbased business model for the vacation rental listing business of homeaway may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the 

  

consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom rewards program our brand expedia expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program hotelscom rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on over 20 brand expedia websites orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks sm  the currency of orbitz rewards on flights hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

business combinations 

we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates 

  

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we typically first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if so we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise periodically we may choose to forgo the initial qualitative assessment and perform quantitative analysis to assist in our annual evaluation 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset 

  

group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in the period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the 

  

customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy and other taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the appropriate valuation techniques including the blackscholes and monte carlo optionpricing models we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the models change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in twentythree lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 43 million as of december 31 2015 and 62 million as of december 31 2014 

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina minnesota oregon rhode island and maryland the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including to the states of new york south carolina north carolina minnesota georgia wyoming oregon rhode island montana and maryland the district of columbia and the city of new york as well as certain other county and local jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously 

  

hawaii general excise tax on january 31 2011 the online travel companies received final notices of assessment for general excise taxes for the tax years 2000 to 2011 on their services relating to noncommissioned hotel room reservations the companies appealed these assessments to the hawaii tax court on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that the online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on both the amount paid to the online travel companies for their services and the amount paid to the hotel for the room thus subjecting the hotel’s charge for the room to double taxation because general excise taxes on the hotel room had already been paid for all of the years at issue on march 15 2013 the hawaii tax court issued penalties against the online travel companies for their failure to file returns and pay general excise taxes on august 12 2013 the court further held that interest is due on such penalties the case proceeded directly to the hawaii supreme court for review and was not considered by the hawaii court of appeals on march 17 2015 the hawaii supreme court issued a decision on the pending appeal the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the hawaii tax court’s decision specifically the court ruled that while the online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on the amount paid to them for their services along with penalties the online travel companies are not liable for general excise taxes interest or penalties on the amount paid to the hotel for the room the department of taxation dismissed without prejudice its common law claims for the recovery of general excise taxes 

as a precondition to appealing the tax court rulings the expedia companies and orbitz were required to “paytoplay” the total amount that the expedia companies paid in 2013 to appeal the tax court ruling was 171 million comprised of 78 million in taxes 41 million in penalties and 52 million in interest in light of the hawaii supreme court decision the state agreed to refund the expedia companies 132 million which was subsequently paid to expedia in september 2015 as a result we recognized a gain in legal reserves occupancy tax and other during 2015 related to this matter also in september 2015 orbitz received a similar refund of 22 million from the state of hawaii the amount paid net of refunds by the expedia companies and orbitz to the state of hawaii in satisfaction of past general excise taxes on their services is 44 million 

in addition the department of taxation has issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies including orbitz for i noncommissioned hotel reservations for the tax year 2012 totaling 26 million which includes 6 million for orbitz ii noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars for the tax years 2000 through 2012 totaling 39 million which includes 10 million for orbitz and a duplicative assessment for expedia and hotelscom totaling 93 million and thus are overstated and iii noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel reservations and car rental for the tax year 2013 totaling 34 million which includes 5 million for orbitz similar assessments also have been issued against other online travel companies these assessments are currently under review in tax court 

the department of taxation has issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies including orbitz dated december 23 2015 for the time period 2000 to 2014 for hotel and car rental revenue for “agency model” transactions and hotel and car rental revenue for “merchant model” transactions for 2014 these assessments total 12 million including tax interest and penalties 

san francisco during 2009 we were required to “paytoplay” and paid 48 million in advance of litigation relating to occupancy tax proceedings with the city of san francisco the city of san francisco subsequently issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the online travel companies including against certain expedia companies the additional assessments including the prepayment of such assessments were contested by the expedia companies on the basis that the court has already ruled that taxes are not due from the online travel companies and that binding precedent by the california court of appeals precludes the city’s claim for taxes on may 14 2014 the court heard oral argument on the expedia companies’ contest of the prepayment requirement for the additional assessments and held that the expedia companies were required to prepay in order to litigate the legality of the assessments on may 26 2014 the expedia companies paid 255 million under protest in order to contest the additional assessments the additional assessments were expensed during the second quarter of 2014 in addition orbitz in total has paid 46 million to the city of san francisco in prepayment of taxes to 

  

contest these assessments issued against it by the city on august 6 2014 the california court of appeals stayed this case pending review and decision by the california supreme court of the city of san diego california litigation 

other jurisdictions we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign tax authorities some of which including in the united kingdom regarding the application of value added tax “vat” to our european union related transactions impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

segments 

beginning in the first quarter of 2015 we had four reportable segments core ota trivago egencia and elong through its disposal on may 22 2015 the change from two reportable segments leisure and egencia resulted in our previously disclosed leisure reportable segment being disaggregated into three segments as a result of the company’s focus on providing additional information to reflect the unique market opportunities and competitive dynamics inherent in our elong and trivago businesses the acquisition of homeaway on december 15 2015 resulted in the creation of an additional segment our core ota segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world orbitzcom expedia affiliate network hotwirecom travelocity venere wotif group carrentalscom and classic vacations our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites our egencia segment which also includes orbitz for business provides managed travel services to corporate customers worldwide our homeaway segment operates an online marketplace for the vacation rental industry 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

  

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

  

  the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily driven by growth in the core ota segment including strong performance at brand expedia and hotelscom acquisitions added approximately 10 of inorganic gross bookings growth for 2015 impacts from acquisitions exclude travelocity due to the previously implemented commercial agreement the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by 26 growth in hotel room nights and 28 increase in air tickets 

revenue margin decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower revenue per room night these impacts were partially offset by a favorable impact of lower air ticket prices and a mix shift to higher margin products including advertising and media revenue revenue margin decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenue per room night partially offset by the growth in advertising and media revenue 

results of operations 

on may 22 2015 we completed the sale of our 624 ownership stake in elong the below discussion of the results of operations for 2015 include results for elong through its disposal on may 22 2015 operating expense tables below present total expenses including elong as well as elong specific amounts included within the consolidated total 

on september 17 2015 we completed our acquisition of orbitz orbitz was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date and we have recognized 196 million in revenue and 163 million in operating losses including restructuring charges of 92 million as well as fees related to the acquisition for 2015 

on december 15 2015 we completed our acquisition of homeaway homeaway was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date and we have recognized 20 million in revenue and 14 million in operating loss including fees related to the acquisition in 2015 the results of homeaway did not have a material impact on our results of operations 

  

revenue 

 

 in 2015 revenue increased primarily due to growth in the core ota segment including strong performance at brand expedia hotelscom and ean as well as growth at trivago partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the sale of elong in 2014 revenue increased primarily due to growth in hotel and advertising and media revenue acquisitions added approximately 8 and 1 to the yearoveryear growth rates in total revenue for 2015 and 2014 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 14 17 excluding elong in 2015 primarily due to a 19 36 excluding elong increase in room nights stayed driven by the inorganic impact of acquisitions as well as the healthy growth in hotelscom and brand expedia partially offset by a 4 decrease 14 excluding elong in revenue per room night in 2015 absent elong revenue per room night decreased primarily due to strategic margin reductions aimed at expanding the size and availability of our global hotel supply portfolio an unfavorable foreign exchange impact both in translation and in booktostay as well as increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs revenue per room night is expected to continue to decrease yearoveryear in 2016 absent impacts due to the sale of elong adrs decreased by 5 primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact acquisitions added approximately 6 of inorganic hotel revenue growth in 2015 and 7 of room night growth worldwide hotel revenue increased 18 in 2014 primarily due to a 26 increase in room nights stayed driven by brand expedia and hotelscom partially offset by a 6 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased primarily due to efforts to expand the size and availability of the global hotel supply portfolio as well as promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs this decline was partially offset by a 2 increase in adrs in 2014 compared to 2013

the remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services fees related to our corporate travel business and homeaway revenue increased by 19 in 2015 and 29 in 2014 primarily due to strong growth in advertising and media revenue as well as growth in our travel insurance and car rental products 

  

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

  

 the increase in merchant revenue in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the increase in merchant hotel revenue driven by an increase in room nights stayed the increase in agency revenue in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the growth in agency hotel and air the increase in advertising and media revenue in 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to continued growth in trivago and expedia media solutions

during 2015 we received a refund of prepaid paytoplay payments of 132 million from the state of hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation in addition during 2015 we recorded a 24 million benefit in legal reserves occupancy tax and other for the recovery of costs related to occupancy tax litigation matters these gains were partially offset by charges for changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes during 2014 we recognized approximately 255 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the san francisco occupancy tax proceedings during 2013 we recognized 64 million for amounts paid or expected to be paid in advance of litigation primarily related to penalties and interest in connection with hawaii’s general excise tax litigation for additional information see note 17 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

operating income 

 

 in 2015 operating income decreased due to increased costs and expenses including growth in selling and marketing expense in excess of revenue growth growth in general and administrative expense in excess of revenue growth as well as an increase in restructuring and related reorganization charges partially offset by the gain of 132 million related to the hawaii paytoplay refunds discussed above 

in 2014 operating income increased due to the growth in revenue acquisitionrelated and other expenses in 2013 that did not recur and lower legal reserve occupancy tax and other charges in 2014 partially offset by restructuring and related reorganization charges in 2014 

included in our consolidated operating income for 2015 are operating losses for elong through its disposition date of may 22 2015 of 86 million in the prior year periods elong had operating losses of 51 million for 2014 and operating losses of 29 million for 2013 

interest income and expense 

 

 interest income decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower invested balances and lower rates of return lower rates of return were due to a shift out of higheryielding currencies due to the sale of elong and funding us dollar denominated acquisitions and lower market rates in certain currencies interest income increased in 2014 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalent and investment balances 

interest expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of additional interest on the 500 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2014 the euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes issued in june 2015 as well as the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in december 2015 interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of additional interest on the 500 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2014

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 provision for income taxes 

 

 the increase in the effective rate for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the gain on the sale of elong during 2015 and the release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in 2014 our effective tax rate for 2015 was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower as well as the sale of elong which had a us effective rate of less than 35 

the decrease in the effective rate for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2001 through 2005 federal tax years and the associated release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as well as nondeductible stockbased compensation recorded related to the trivago acquisition and nondeductible penalties included in the hawaii paytoplay assessments in 2013 our effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states as well as the release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 

in 2013 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states partially offset by recording a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of certain australian and chinese entities in 2013 as well as nondeductible charges in 2013 in connection with the trivago acquisition and hawaii paytoplay assessments mentioned above 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 17 billion and 18 billion at december 31 2015 and 2014 including 645 million and 369 million of cash and shortterm investment balances held in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries which includes 441 million and 190 million related to earnings indefinitely invested outside the united states as well as 72 million and 304 million held in majorityowned subsidiaries which is also indefinitely invested outside the united states and our 15 billion revolving credit facility cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states totaled 15 billion as of december 31 2015 to date we have permanently reinvested the majority of these foreign earnings outside of the united states and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to us income taxes 

  

as of december 31 2015 we maintained a 1 billion revolving credit facility that had a september 2019 maturity date of which 971 million was available representing the total 1 billion facility less 29 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” the facility contained various restrictive covenants including a maximum permissible leverage ratio and a minimum permissible interest coverage ratio and interest payable under the facility was based on the company’s credit ratings as of december 31 2015 the maximum permissible leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage were both 325 to 100 the applicable interest rate on drawn amounts was libor plus 150 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts was 20 basis points 

in february 2016 we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility that among other things increased the aggregate commitments under the facility to 15 billion extended the maturity date to february 2021 reduced the currently applicable interest rate on drawn amounts by 125 basis points to libor plus 1375 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts by 25 basis points to 175 basis points increased the maximum permissible leverage ratio to 375 to 100 and reduced the minimum permissible interest coverage ratio to 300 to 100 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the “25 notes” the 25 notes were issued at 99525 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable annually in arrears in june of each year beginning june 3 2016 

in december 2015 we privately placed 750 million of senior unsecured notes that are due in february 2026 and bear interest at 50 the “50 notes” the 50 notes were issued at 99535 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in arrears in february and august of each year beginning august 15 2016 we used or expect to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the homeaway acquisition to refinance existing homeaway indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2015 moody’s rating was ba1 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt which was comprised of 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2018 that bear interest at 7456 the “7456 notes” 750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 595 the “595 notes” 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 45 the “45 notes” the 25 notes and the 50 notes 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally 

  

consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel advertising or certain expedia affiliate network relationships or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers such as with mobile bookings via smartphones our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed our future working capital benefits could also be impacted by the transition of our recent homeaway acquisition’s shift to more of a transactional model from a subscription model 

as our etp program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling up of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow relative liquidity during the transition and hotel revenue margins 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp as well as the assimilation and transformation of the homeaway vacation rental listing business may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2015 we had a deficit in our working capital of 29 billion compared to a deficit of 13 billion as of december 31 2014 the change in deficit is primarily due to financing and investing activities including cash paid for the business acquisitions and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the 25 notes and the 50 notes as well as the proceeds from the sale of elong business acquisitions in the current year included homeaway orbitz worldwide airasiaexpedia and travelocity and capital expenditures included our new corporate headquarters 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements in infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt our capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be broadly in line with 2015 spending levels and are expected to include approximately 70 million related to the build out of our new corporate headquarters the build out will continue through 2019 with more significant spend related to the project occurring in 2017 and 2018 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 in 2015 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations remained essentially flat as a net refund of hotel occupancy and other taxes was mostly offset by decreased benefits from working capital changes including increases in income tax and interest payments in 2014 net cash provided by operating 

  

activities from continuing operations increased by 604 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization as well as lower paytoplay tax assessment payments in the current year 

in 2015 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased by 14 billion primarily due to an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 15 billion due primarily to our acquisition of orbitz in september 2015 and homeaway in december 2015 as well as higher capital expenditures of 460 million including amounts paid for our new corporate headquarters partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of elong of 524 million in 2014 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased 398 million primarily due to net purchases of investments of 32 million in the current period compared to cash provided by net sales and maturities of investments of 286 million in 2013 as well as a cash outflow of 5 million due to the net settlement of foreign currency forwards compared to a cash inflow of 41 million in the prior year 

cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2015 primarily included 700 million of net proceeds for the issuance of 25 notes in june 2015 741 million in net proceeds for the issuance of the 50 notes in december 2015 120 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock and 91 million in excess tax benefit on equity awards of which approximately 47 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our chairman and senior executive these financing inflows were offset in part by 85 million of withholding taxes for stock option exercises paid on behalf of our chairman and senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled as well as cash paid to acquire shares of 61 million primarily under the repurchase authorizations discussed below and 109 million cash dividend payments cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2014 primarily included 493 million of net proceeds for the issuance of 45 notes in august 2014 and 129 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 538 million including the repurchased shares under the 2012 authorization discussed below and 85 million cash dividend payment cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2013 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 523 million including the repurchased shares under the 2012 authorization discussed below as well as 76 million cash dividend payments partially offset by 82 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock 

during 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during each of the respective years and during 2015 authorized a repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock for a total of 70 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 

 

  

 as of december 31 2015 112 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2012 and 2015 authorizations with no fixed termination date for the repurchases 

our common stock dividend was 084 per share for 2015 066 per share for 2014 and 056 per share for 2013 see note 13 — stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition in february 2016 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 024 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 30 2016 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10 2016 future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

  

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2015 showed a net change of 18 million reflecting higher depreciation in foreign currencies in the current year compared to the prior year the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2014 showed a net change of 78 million reflecting higher depreciation in foreign currencies in the 2014 compared to 2013 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2015 

 

  

       

during march 2013 we completed the purchase of a 63 equity position in trivago the purchase agreement contains certain putcall rights whereby we may acquire and the minority shareholders of trivago may sell to us up to 50 and 100 of the minority shares of the company at fair value during two windows the first of which opens in the first quarter of 2016 our redeemable noncontrolling interest balance related to trivago was 654 million as of december 31 2015 which has not been included within the contractual obligations table above and represents our best estimate of fair value the final redemption amount could materially differ from this estimate based on the final negotiations the second putcall window opens in 2018 

other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015 

certain relationships and related party transactions

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 25 see “foreign exchange risk” below for further discussion or our 25 notes in december 2015 we issued 750 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 50 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes 595 notes 45 notes 25 notes and 50 notes were approximately 555 million 827 million 487 million 705 million and 750 million as of december 31 2015 as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 7 million our 595 notes by approximately 17 million our 45 notes by approximately 17 million our 25 notes by approximately 20 million and our 50 notes by approximately 30 million 

we maintain a 15 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we invest in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2015 we had 98 million of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in bond prices would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately 1 million as of december 31 2015  such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

  

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 or 2013 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had a net forward asset of 8 million and 9 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in june 2015 we issued euro 650 million of registered senior unsecured notes that are due in june 2022 and bear interest at 25 the aggregate principal value of the 25 notes is designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries the notes are measured at euro to us dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss the eurodenominated net assets of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at each balance sheet date with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss since the notional amount of the recorded eurodenominated debt is less than the notional amount of our net investment we do not expect to incur any ineffectiveness on this hedge 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 17 million based on our foreign currency forward positions including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2015 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 25 million 15 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 6 million 14 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and 1 million 

  

13 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

market opportunity  business strategy 

expedia is one of the world’s largest online travel companies yet our gross bookings represent only about 4 of total worldwide travel spending phocuswright estimates global travel spending at approximately 13 trillion with an increasing share booked through online channels each year we have built and continue to build a broad and deep supply portfolio which today includes approximately 435000 properties 400 airlines and numerous car rental companies cruise companies and other travel suppliers 

we are focused on revolutionizing travel through the power of technology we believe the strength of our brand portfolio as well as our enhanced product offerings and new channel penetration drives customer demand which when combined with our global scale and broad based supply give us a unique advantage in addressing the ongoing migration of travel bookings from offline to online around the world with our unmatched global audience of travelers and our deep and broad selection of travel products there is a rich interplay between supply and demand in our global marketplace that helps us provide value to both travelers planning trips and supply partners wanting to grow their business through a better understanding of travel retailing and consumer demand in addition to reaching consumers in markets beyond their reach our primary growth drivers are technology and product innovation global expansion and new channel penetration

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades they each operate a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and help customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched new global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands in 2013 expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded sites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas the shift of travelocitybranded sites to the expedia technology platform was successfully completed over the course of 2014 in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently announced plans to shift the wotif group sites and operations onto the expedia platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers additionally we are finding key commercial deals and acquisitions which enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth 

  

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own a majority share of elong a leading online travel company in china we also own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in southern europe egencia our corporate travel business operates in more than 60 countries around the world and continues to expand including its 2012 acquisition of via travel we also partner in a 5050 joint venture with airasia — a low cost carrier serving the asiapacific region — to jointly grow an online travel agency business although the results for the joint venture are not consolidated in our financial statements we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy in 2014 approximately 41 of our worldwide gross bookings and 47 of worldwide revenue were through international points of sale compared to just 22 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a goal of generating at least 65 of our revenue through businesses and points of sale outside of the united states 

during march 2013 we completed our majority acquisition of trivago a leading hotel metasearch company officially launched in 2005 trivago is one of the best known travel brands in europe trivago continues to operate independently and plans to rapidly grow revenue through global expansion including aggressive expansion in the united states and canada among other countries 

during july 2014 we completed the acquisition of auto escape group one of europe’s leading online car rental reservation companies auto escape group has joined with the carrentalscom brand allowing it to expand internationally to provide our customers more choices across the globe and help our supply partners expand their marketing reach 

during november 2014 we completed the acquisition of wotif group an australian online travel company wotif group adds to our collection of travel’s most trusted brands and enhances our supply in the asiapacific region while allowing expedia to expose the wotif group to our worldclass technology and its customers to our extensive global supply 

during january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre as a result of the acquisition the strategic marketing agreement previously entered into during 2013 which joined travelocity’s strong brand with our bestinclass booking platform supply base and customer service was terminated evolving this relationship strengthens expedia inc’s ability to continue to innovate and deliver the best travel experiences to the widest set of travelers all over the world 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration  today the majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we believe mobile bookings via smartphones present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last few years customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from 

  

trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop in addition we are seeing increasing crossdevice usage among our customers who connect to our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe in the future mobile is likely to represent an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during 2014 more than one in five expedia inc transactions was booked globally on a mobile device 

merchant and agency business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under both models we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers under the merchant model we are the merchant of record under the agency model the travel supplier is the merchant of record during 2012 we introduced the expedia traveler preference “etp” program that enables much closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant offering specifically for participating hotels we offer customers the choice of whether to pay expedia in advance expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect 

today the majority of our merchant revenue primarily relates to hotel bookings as part of the introduction of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs therefore the global rollout of etp has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking and we expect will continue to do so in the future in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering and continue to roll out etp we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions based on these dynamics we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

  

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed via a proprietary extranet 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers to our sites 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media sites offline advertising loyalty programs and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include welcome rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia ®  rewards on expediacom and expediaca the cost of these two loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia or hotelscom cobranded offering or a private label website our ean business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide on range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador egypt and india we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have 24hour monitoring and engineering support these data centers have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the 

  

websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities our technology systems are subject to certain risks which are described below in part i item 1a — risk factors 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services large online portals and search websites certain travel metasearch websites mobile travel applications social media websites as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult we also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs in addition competitive pressure is particularly acute in china where we operate primarily through our majorityowned subsidiary elong elong has in the past and may also increasingly in the future invest heavily in marketing as well as headcount to support their mobile product technology and supply development they also engage in discounting and couponing activity these actions are likely to result in increasing operating losses in china as elong attempts to grow market share and remain competitive 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs complimentary services such as wifi and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks copyright domain names trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content brands software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and license and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may 

  

be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property and proprietary information without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

additionally we are subject to consumer protection privacy and consumer data labor economic and trade sanction programs tax and antitrust and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry some of these laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our various business models 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

we generate our revenue through a diverse customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers no customer represented 10 or more of our total revenue in the periods presented in this annual report on form 10k

 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

online and traditional travel agencies we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies “otas” in many regions such as the priceline group and its subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom orbitz and regional competitors such as ctrip which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers including pricing and supply breadth we also compete with traditional travel agencies wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability complimentary wifi and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

search engines we also face increasing competition from search engines including google bing and yahoo search to the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning shopping or booking capabilities or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites or offer the ability to transact on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example in recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content comparable to otas to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our websites or websites in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivagobranded websites compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases than us we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

travel metasearch engines travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of priceline trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia tripadvisor and qunar a subsidiary of baidu aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch sites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of our brands to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize the metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our acquisition of a majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise trivago’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

  

corporate travel management service providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers including carlson wagonlit and american express as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services including concur some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases differentiated business models or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile platform travel applications mobile platforms including smartphones and tablet computers have rapidly emerged and continue to grow significantly the emergence and improved functionality of mobile platforms has led to an increased use by consumers of standalone applications to research and book travel if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

social media websites social media websites including facebook continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition 

other participants in the travel industry traditional consumer ecommerce websites such as amazon and group buying websites such as groupon have been expanding their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites to the extent such websites continue to expand these services over time it may create additional competition in addition airbnb homeaway and similar websites facilitate the shortterm rental of homes and apartments from owners thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms the continued growth of peertopeer inventory sources could affect the demand for our services in facilitating reservations at hotels 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity in addition competitive pressure is particularly acute in china where we operate primarily through our majorityowned subsidiary elong in an effort to compete effectively elong is increasing levels of investment in marketing mobile product technology and supply development as well as engaging in discounting and couponing activity which has had and is expected to continue to have at increasing rates an adverse effect on elong’s financial condition and operating results 

in general increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in emerging channels such as metasearch developing products for new platforms such as mobile offering new consumer choices such as our etp program and increasing supplier inventory on our existing platforms through acquisitions and partnerships if we fail to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments our business could be adversely affected our attempts to adapt our current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives inadequate return on investments difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of the inventory of acquired brands onto our platforms as well as limiting our ability to develop new site innovations in addition adaptations to our business may 

  

require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs and increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers in addition these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

for example during 2012 expedia introduced the etp program to hotel suppliers in the united states and europe and subsequently globally etp offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay as part of the introduction of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs therefore the global rollout of etp has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking and will continue to do so in the future in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering and etp we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions which may negatively impact the margin of revenue we earn in the future depending on relative supplier and traveler adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the expansion of etp could continue to negatively impact our near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and the websites of our affiliates search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites and those of our affiliates can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites and those of our affiliates through participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google and travel metasearch engines including kayak and tripadvisor pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place lower in search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites and the websites of our affiliates or those of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent in addition certain metasearch companies have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites to the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings this may reduce the amount of traffic to our websites or those of our affiliates 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm hotel and airline contracts no assurances can be given that travel suppliers or gds partners will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to implement costly direct connections charge travel agencies for or otherwise restrict access to content credit card fees or other services further reduce their average daily rates “adrs” or decide not to make their travel inventory available to us or provide accurate booking information any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

historically certain travel suppliers have and may continue to pursue distribution strategies that could reduce our access to inventory reduce our compensation or result in additional operating expenses in addition a 

  

number of airlines charge for checked baggage food beverages and other services that gdss are currently unable to provide to us impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines’ own sites or other channels that show this content detail 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including increased spending from our competitors promotional and discounting activities the costs of customer loyalty programs the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among our multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative travelrelated traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines during 2014 certain online travel companies and metasearch sites continued to expand their offline advertising campaigns globally increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities particularly in china and certain other markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service supplier connectivity communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings the emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies for such platforms have and will continue to require new and costly investments in technology we may not be successful or less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as service providers could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion innovate more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits these migrations have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may 

  

continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site innovations in addition during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems or enhancements to existing infrastructure technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

a large and growing portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue has increased from 39 in 2010 to 47 in 2014 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we enter countries and markets that are new to us we must tailor our services and business models to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

we also earn an increasing portion of our income and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions as a result any repatriation of funds currently held by our subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions may result in a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 we are subject to particular risks and uncertainties relating to our operations in china which we conduct primarily through elong which is a leading online travel service provider in china and is a separately listed company on nasdaq the success of elong and of our other current and future business and investments in china is subject to commercial risks relating to the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in china which has required that elong increase their investments in advertising marketing and resources to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in addition to aggressive sales and marketing efforts elong has in the past and may increasingly in the future invest heavily in headcount to support their mobile product technology and supply development as well as engage in discounting and couponing activity elong may not be able to successfully grow or maintain market share and brand awareness and even if they are successful their efforts may not be costeffective as a result elong has in the past and may increasingly in the future incur operating losses in china 

our business and investments in china are also subject to numerous risks and significant uncertainties regarding the application development and interpretation of china’s laws and regulations which could limit the legal protections available to us moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in areas such as the travel industry the internet and online commerce foreign investment taxation labor and foreign currency exchange in addition chinese law restricts foreign investment in areas including airticketing travel agency internet content provision and telecommunications and requires certain licenses and permits related to our business be held by legal entities owned by prc citizens or chineseowned companies rather than our subsidiaries although we have established effective control over such chinese entities through a series of agreements future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could adversely affect our control over and the operations of our businesses in china capitalization of our chinese entities is also subject to regulation and there can be no assurance that we can provide adequate financing for these entities or repatriate cash balances and investments china also does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have such treaties may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china as we are the controlling shareholder of elong we may also be subject to legal or regulatory investigations or claims relating to any alleged improper conduct or violations of us law nasdaq or sec regulations or other applicable law or regulations by elong which may result in significant costs fines or penalties being assessed against elong and us in 2014 an sec administrative law judge issued an initial decision censuring certain chinese audit firms including elong’s external auditor for failing to comply with document requests from the sec and suspended the firms from practicing before the sec for six months the firms in question have appealed the initial decision to the sec and the decision will not become effective until the resolution of the appeal in addition the public company accounting oversight board or “pcaob” may choose to administer sanctions or take other actions against chinese audit firms including elong’s auditor due to the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of audit firms in china if chinese audit firms including elong’s external auditor are suspended or otherwise unable to practice before the sec or maintain registration with the pcaob elong may be unable to meet the ongoing reporting requirements under the exchange act which may ultimately result in elong’s delisting from nasdaq 

  

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance results of operations or business growth 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel licensing the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection anticorruption antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions tax banking data security and privacy as a result regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

likewise the sec department of justice “doj” and office of foreign assets controls “ofac” as well as foreign regulatory authorities have continued to increase the enforcement of economic and trade regulations and anticorruption laws across industries us trade sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries including cuba iran sudan and syria and nationals and others of those countries as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities we believe that our activities comply with ofac trade regulations and anticorruption regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and the uk bribery act as regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we cannot guarantee that our programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities in the event our controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons we could be subject to monetary damages civil and criminal money penalties litigation and damage to our reputation and the value of our brands 

we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection competition tax and travel industryspecific laws and regulations the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

for example in july 2012 the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” the competition authority in the united kingdom issued a statement of objections alleging that expedia and bookingcom entered into separate agreements with intercontinental hotels group plc “ihg” that restricted each online travel company’s ability to discount the price of ihg hotel rooms the oft limited its investigation to a small number of companies but has stated that the investigation is likely to have wider implications for the industry within the 

  

united kingdom the parties have proposed to address the oft’s concerns by offering commitments which were accepted by the oft with no finding of fault or liability skyscanner limited is challenging the oft’s decision as a result the competition  markets authority cma the united kingdom’s competition authority will be reviewing the decision of its predecessor body the oft 

the directorate general for competition consumer affairs and repression of fraud a directorate of the french ministry of economy and finance with authority over unfair trading practices also has brought a lawsuit in france against the expedia entities objecting to certain most favored nations clauses in contracts with french hotels this case is scheduled to go to trial in april 2015 in addition to the oft investigation above a number of competition authorities such as those in belgium china czech republic france germany italy austria hungary sweden ireland denmark and switzerland have initiated sector inquires or investigations into competitive practices within the hotel online booking sector and in particular in relation to most favored nations clauses and other contractual arrangements between hotels and online travel companies including expedia these investigations differ from the oft investigation and also differ in relation to the parties involved and the precise nature of the concerns we have engaged in discussions with certain relevant regulatory authorities regarding their concerns the outcomes of these inquiries or investigations or how our business may be affected is uncertain if we are required to significantly modify or eliminate any most favored nation clauses in our arrangements with hotels we may not be able to offer our consumers with competitive pricing as being offered by other online travel companies 

we note in this context that on december 15 2014 the competition authorities in france italy and sweden announced a proposed set of commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve the most favored nations clause cases brought by these authorities against bookingcom the commitments offered by bookingcom are subject to a public comment period and are not currently final in addition the german federal cartel office “fco” has required another ota hotel reservation service “hrs” to remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with hotels hrs appealed this decision which the higher regional court düsseldorf rejected on january 9 2015 if we are required to significantly modify or eliminate any most favored nation clauses in our arrangements with hotels in europe this may materially and adversely affect our competitive position and business in affected european territories for example by adversely affecting our ability to offer consumers making hotel room bookings on our sites with the most competitive room rates available on other sites 

we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

furthermore our future growth may be limited by antitrust or competition laws for example our business has grown and continues to expand as a consequence our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangement any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete 

application of existing tax laws rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities 

the application of various domestic and international income and nonincome tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities these taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues this has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities as such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax provisions or may require us to modify our business practices to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a number of taxing authorities have made inquiries brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy or other taxes including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with 

  

multiple european union jurisdictions regarding the application of value added tax to our european union transactions while we believe we comply with applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity which payments may be substantial this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes for example as a precondition to challenging the assessments on january 9 2015 we paid 23 million under protest to the city of portland oregon and multnomah county oregon during 2009 we paid 48 million under protest to the city of san francisco and an additional 255 million under protest on may 26 2014 in connection with additional assessments and during 2013 we paid 171 million to the state of hawaii the state of hawaii has also issued additional assessments for general excise tax penalties and interest against expedia hotelscom and hotwire including an assessment of 205 million for 2012 tax year noncommissioned hotel reservations an assessment of 292 million including a duplicative assessments for tax years 2000 through 2012 noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars and an assessment of 285 million for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel reservations and car rental for the tax year 2013 and for which we have requested additional support from the state of hawaii but have not received any response to date 

furthermore due to the global nature of our business we are subject to income and other nonincome taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals in which case we may be subject to additional tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

amendment to existing tax laws rules or regulations or enactment of new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

many of the underlying laws rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax or other laws rules or regulations were amended or if new unfavorable laws rules or regulations were enacted particularly with respect to occupancy valueadded taxes or unclaimed property the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively subject us to interest and penalties decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions as a result these changes could have an adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

in addition in the past us and foreign governments have introduced proposals for tax legislation that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” issued an action plan in july 2013 calling for a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to “base erosion and profit shifting” “beps” by multinational companies any changes to national or international tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely affect our profitability our effective tax rate in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions 

we continue to work with relevant authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging tax laws and regulations 

  

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant legal judgment it is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example during regional or global recessions domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slow spending on the services we provide and have a negative impact on our revenue growth additionally if individual countries or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions andor significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the us dollar it can lead to a negative impact on our foreign denominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance current sovereign debt issues and concern about regional central bank activity and its potential to impact both local and global economies are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and adrs decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have experienced historically 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

we are subject to paymentsrelated and fraud risks 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition an imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by our acceptance of fraudulent bookings made using credit and debit cards we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent bookings on our websites or other bookings for which payment is subsequently disputed by our customers both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings referred to as a “charge back” accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones and tablet computers and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity if we are unable to effectively combat fraudulent bookings on our websites or mobile applications or if we otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

in addition when onboarding suppliers to our websites we may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of our websites and mobile applications a fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity damage to our reputation and could cause users of our websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of our services any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of our brands which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht brazilian real and nordic currencies 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

  

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures more complex we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

  

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we are accumulating a greater portion of our cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings would likely result in additional us income tax expense in addition we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see positive momentum in our global roll out of the etp program launched in 2012 as this program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier and traveler adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

system interruption security breaches and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on information technology systems including the internet and thirdparty hosted services to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data including booking transactions intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners personally identifiable information of our customers and employees and data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments accounting procurement and supply chain activities in addition we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting legal and tax requirements these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks the risk of a cybersecurityrelated attack intrusion or disruption including by criminal organizations hacktivists foreign governments and terrorists is persistent we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon — including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers — and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers damage our reputation and brands increase our costs andor cause losses 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business there can be no guarantee that our existing security measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information intellectual property proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in our operations we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change 

  

frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users and our business partners to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for their own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

in addition no assurance can be given that we have backup systems or contingency plans for all critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

we process store and use personal information payment card information and other consumer data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations 

we may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information payment card information and other consumer data the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information payment card information or other consumer data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in the company as well as subject us to bank fines penalties or increased transaction costs all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online in addition the european union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance finally countries in other regions most notably asia eastern europe and latin america are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted 

  

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty interactive corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty interactive corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 59 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2014 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty interactive corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

  

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that mr diller and mr kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia affiliate network business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers on which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2014 we held cash in bank depository accounts of 911 million primarily in bank of america bnp paribas hsbc jpmorgan chase royal bank of canada and standard chartered bank and held time deposits of approximately 370 million at financial institutions including australia and new zealand banking group dbs bank jpmorgan chase nordea and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of 47 million primarily in deutsche bank industrial and commercial bank of china china construction bank china merchants bank and bank of china and held time deposits of approximately 261 million at financial institutions including industrial and commercial bank of china china merchants bank bank of china and bank of communications as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2014 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 633 million the fair value of which was approximately 9 million the counterparties to these contracts were credit suisse international standard chartered bank goldman sachs bank jpmorgan chase bank of america us bank barclays bank plc bnp paribas wells fargo royal bank of canada bank of tokyomitsubishi and hsbc we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the 

  

deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts 

in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2014 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 17 billion risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

our discretion in the operation of our business is limited by certain factors including various covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness these covenants also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses 

  

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites and mobile applications rely on content brands and technology much of which is proprietary we establish and protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark copyright trade secret and patent laws in the us and other jurisdictions license and confidentiality agreements and internal policies and procedures in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information and intellectual property even with these precautions however it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on both the amount paid to the online travel companies for their services and the amount paid to the hotel for the room thus subjecting the hotel’s charge for the room to double taxation because general excise taxes on the hotel room had already been paid for all of the years at issue on march 15 2013 the hawaii tax court issued penalties against the online travel companies for their failure to file returns and pay general excise taxes on august 12 2013 the court further held that interest is due on such penalties during the pendency of the tax court proceeding the online travel companies petitioned the hawaii supreme court for immediate review of the tax court’s january 11 2013 ruling holding the companies liable for general excise tax the hawaii supreme court denied the online travel companies’ petition on april 22 2013 the tax court proceeding subsequently concluded and on september 11 2013 the online travel companies filed their notice of appeal on december 24 2013 the hawaii supreme court agreed to accept transfer and review of the case and the case proceeded directly to the hawaii supreme court for review and was not considered by the hawaii court of appeals on october 2 2014 the hawaii supreme court heard oral argument in the appeal we strongly believe that the tax court ruling regarding the general excise tax is contrary to the plain language of the ordinances at issue as well as prior hawaiian supreme court decisions previous positions taken by the hawaii director of taxation and an opinion by the attorney general of the state of hawaii the department of taxation has dismissed without prejudice its common law claims for the recovery of general excise taxes 

as a precondition to appealing the tax court rulings the expedia companies were required to pay an amount equal to taxes penalties and interest this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to the taxes in question to the extent our appeal is successful in reducing or eliminating the assessed amounts the state of hawaii would be required to repay such amounts plus interest the total amount that the expedia companies paid in 2013 to appeal the tax court ruling was 171 million compromised of 78 million in taxes 41 million in penalties and 52 million in interest the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded and our estimates of possible penalties and additional assessments 

in addition on may 20 2013 the department of taxation issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies for noncommissioned hotel reservations totaling 205 million for the tax year 2012 on june 17 2013 the online travel companies appealed these assessments to the hawaii tax court on december 13 2013 the tax court held proceedings in abeyance pending review and decision by the hawaii supreme court on the prior assessments 

on december 9 2013 the department of taxation also issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the online travel companies for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars totaling 292 million for the years 2000 to 2012 these assessments include a duplicative assessment for expedia and hotelscom totaling 93 million and thus are overstated on january 7 2013 the online travel companies appealed the assessments to the hawaii tax court on march 12 2014 the online travel companies requested that the tax court stay consideration of these assessments pending the decision by the hawaii supreme court on april 28 2014 the tax court granted the online travel companies’ request that the court stay consideration of the department of taxation’s car rental assessments pending a decision by the hawaii supreme court 

on july 18 2014 the department of taxation issued final general excise tax assessments totaling 285 million for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel reservations and car rental for tax year 2013 the online travel companies protested the assessments and requested additional support from the state for the numbers included in the assessments on december 22 2014 the court stayed these assessments pending review and decision by the hawaii supreme court on prior tax assessments

hotel booking practices proceedings and litigation 

matters relating to hotel booking practices  on july 31 2012 the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” issued a statement of objections alleging that expedia bookingcom bv and intercontinental hotels group plc “ihg” have infringed european union and united kingdom competition law in relation to the online supply of hotel room accommodations the statement of objections alleges that expedia and bookingcom entered into separate agreements with ihg that restricted each online travel company’s ability to discount the price of ihg hotel rooms the oft limited its investigation to a small number of companies but stated that the investigation was likely to have wider implications for the industry within the united kingdom the parties proposed to address the oft’s concerns by offering commitments and on january 31 2014 the oft announced that it had formally accepted the commitments offered by the parties with no finding of fault or liability the commitments provide online travel companies with the right to provide nonpublic discounts on the rate offered for room only hotel accommodation bookings at hotels located in the united kingdom to eligible european economic area resident members of the online travel companies’ closed groups the commitments also clarify the hotels’ rights to offer discounts under the same conditions to members of their closed groups in addition the commitments require online travel agencies to modify their most favored nation clauses as relevant so as not to apply to any discounting activities covered by the commitments the commitments were expressed to be binding on the parties through january 31 2016 on march 31 2014 skyscanner limited filed a judicial review application challenging the oft’s january 31 2014 decision to accept the parties’ commitments on september 26 2014 the united kingdom’s competition appeal tribunal “cat” granted skyscanner limited’s appeal quashing the oft commitments decision and removing the legally binding effect of the commitments on expedia and the other two parties this judgment further requires the competition  markets authority “cma” the united kingdom’s competition authority to review the decision of its predecessor body the oft the cma did not appeal the cat’s decision the cma is currently considering what further action it may take in this case and the outcome of this assessment is uncertain 

the directorate general for competition consumer affairs and repression of fraud a directorate of the french ministry of economy and finance with authority over unfair trading practices also has brought a lawsuit in france against the expedia entities objecting to certain most favored nations clauses in contracts with french 

  

hotels this case is scheduled to go to trial in april 2015 in addition a number of competition authorities such as those in austria china czech republic denmark france germany hungary ireland italy sweden and switzerland have initiated sector inquiries or investigations into competitive practices within the hotel online booking sector and in particular in relation to most favored nation clauses and other contractual arrangements between hotels and online travel companies including expedia these investigations differ from the oft investigation in relation to the parties involved and the precise nature of the concerns the outcomes of these inquiries or investigations or how our business may be affected is uncertain 

we note in this context that on december 15 2014 the competition authorities in france italy and sweden announced a proposed set of commitments offered by bookingcom to resolve the most favored nations clause cases brought by these authorities against bookingcom the commitments offered by bookingcom are subject to a public comment period and are not currently final in addition the german federal cartel office “fco” has required another online travel company hotel reservation service hrs to remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with hotels hrs appealed this decision which the higher regional court dusseldorf rejected on january 9 2015 if we are required to significantly modify or eliminate any most favored nation clauses in our arrangements with hotels in europe this may materially and adversely affect our competitive position and business in affected european territories for example by adversely affecting our ability to offer consumers making hotel room bookings on our sites with the most competitive room rates available on other sites 

more than thirty putative class action lawsuits which refer to the oft’s statement of objections were initiated in the united states by consumer plaintiffs alleging claims against the online travel companies including expedia and several major hotel chains for alleged resale price maintenance for online hotel room reservations including but not limited to violation of the sherman act state antitrust laws state consumer protection statutes and common law tort claims such as unjust enrichment the cases were consolidated and transferred to judge boyle in the united states district court for the northern district of texas on may 1 2013 the plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint on july 1 2013 the defendants filed motions to dismiss that complaint a hearing on the defendants’ motions to dismiss took place on december 17 2013 on february 18 2014 the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss but allowed the plaintiffs the opportunity to move for leave to amend their complaint on march 20 2014 the plaintiffs filed their motion for leave to amend on october 28 2014 the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion plaintiffs did not appeal thereby ending the case

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2013 and 2014 have represented years of continuing improvement for the travel industry however natural disasters and severe weather conditions healthrelated risks such as ebola geopolitical conflicts significant fluctuations in currency values sovereign debt issues and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2014 approximately 60 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occur online compared with approximately 50 of european travel online penetration rates in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of europe and are estimated to be in the range of 20 to 25 these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing which has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom which the priceline group acquired in may 2013 trivago in which expedia acquired a majority ownership interest in march 2013 as well as tripadvisor which completed its conversion to a metasearch site in june 2013 introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies in addition certain metasearch companies adopted or intend to adopt various forms of direct or assistedbooking 

  

tools the impact of which is currently uncertain furthermore we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations licensing deals and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google finally traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites such as amazon and groupon have been expanding their local offerings into the travel market by adding hotel offers to their sites 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe expedia has both merchant expedia collect and agency hotel hotel collect offerings for our hotel supply partners and we expect our use of these models to continue to evolve during 2012 expedia introduced the etp program to hotel suppliers in the united states and europe and began rolling the program out globally in 2013 etp offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition also historically led to aggressive marketing efforts by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis at the local or regional level making decisions in each market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is lower than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive in addition to aggressive sales and marketing efforts our subsidiary elong has in the past and may also increasingly in the future invest heavily in mobile product technology and supply development as well as engage in discounting and couponing activity which is likely to result in increasing operating losses in the chinese market as they attempt to grow market share and remain competitive the crowded online travel environment is now driving secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing consumer mind share 

hotel 

we generate the majority of our revenue through the marketing and distribution of hotel rooms standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners have remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering in some cases we have reduced and expect to continue to reduce our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions lastly we have seen a higher mix of our room night growth coming from markets such as china where our hotel margins are lower and we have implemented new customer loyalty and discount programs in order to attract and retain repeat customers based on these dynamics our average revenue per room night declined in each quarter of 2012 2013 and 2014 and we expect it to remain under pressure in the future all of these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry have generally increased in a gradually improving overall travel environment currently occupancy rates are near 2007 peaks and there is very little new net hotel supply being added in the us lodging market with large chains focusing their development opportunities in international markets this may help hoteliers with their objective of continuing to grow adrs and tends to lead to pressure in our negotiations and terms with hoteliers in international markets hotel supply is being added at a much faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as china and india among others recently our reported international adrs have also been unfavorably impacted in 

  

many regions by the strengthening us dollar we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with approximately 435000 properties on our global websites including elong as of december 31 2014 in addition our room night growth has been healthy with room nights growing 27 in 2012 23 in 2013 and 26 in 2014 adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites declined 2 in 2012 were essentially flat in 2013 and increased 2 in 2014 

air 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil including significant air carrier consolidation in the united states which has generally resulted in lower overall capacity and higher fares as the demand for travel continued to increase in 2014 air carriers have kept capacity growth relatively low the significant decline in fuel prices in the second half of 2014 did not translate into reduced air fares resulting in record levels of profitability for the us air carriers further strengthening their position ticket prices on expedia sites remained flat in 2014 and increased 1 and 4 in 2013 and 2012 respectively we continue to encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine and as certain supply agreements renew 

air ticket volumes grew by 28 in 2014 primarily due to volume driven by brand expedia’s marketing agreement with travelocity along with ongoing improvements for the brand expedia sites themselves air volumes improved 9 in 2013 largely due to strong growth in corporate ticket volumes at egencia 

from a product perspective in 2014 70 of our revenue came from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with 8 of our revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we believe that the hotel product is the most profitable of the products we distribute and represents our best overall growth opportunity 

advertising  media 

our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago a leading hotel metasearch site in addition to expedia media solutions which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands in 2014 we generated a total of 479 million of advertising and media revenue representing 8 of total revenue up substantially from 319 million in 2013 

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades they each operate a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and help customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched new global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands in 2013 expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded sites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas the shift of travelocitybranded sites to the expedia technology platform was successfully completed over the course of 2014 in november 2014 expedia completed the acquisition of wotif group and subsequently announced plans to shift the wotif group sites and operations onto the expedia platform in january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into were terminated we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers additionally we are finding key commercial deals and acquisitions which enable us to leverage our existing technology and operations infrastructure to amplify our growth 

  

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own a majority share of elong a leading online travel company in china we also own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in southern europe egencia our corporate travel business operates in more than 60 countries around the world and continues to expand including its 2012 acquisition of via travel we also partner in a 5050 joint venture with airasia — a low cost carrier serving the asiapacific region — to jointly grow an online travel agency business although the results for the joint venture are not consolidated in our financial statements we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy in 2014 approximately 41 of our worldwide gross bookings and 47 of worldwide revenue were through international points of sale compared to just 22 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a goal of generating at least 65 of our revenue through businesses and points of sale outside of the united states 

during march 2013 we completed our majority acquisition of trivago a leading hotel metasearch company officially launched in 2005 trivago is one of the best known travel brands in europe trivago continues to operate independently and plans to rapidly grow revenue through global expansion including aggressive expansion in the united states and canada among other countries 

during july 2014 we completed the acquisition of auto escape group one of europe’s leading online car rental reservation companies auto escape group has joined with the carrentalscom brand allowing it to expand internationally to provide our customers more choices across the globe and help our supply partners expand their marketing reach 

during november 2014 we completed the acquisition of wotif group an australian online travel company wotif group adds to our collection of travel’s most trusted brands and enhances our supply in the asiapacific region while allowing expedia to expose the wotif group to our worldclass technology and its customers to our extensive global supply 

during january 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre as a result of the acquisition the strategic marketing agreement previously entered into during 2013 which joined travelocity’s strong brand with our bestinclass booking platform supply base and customer service was terminated evolving this relationship strengthens expedia inc’s ability to continue to innovate and deliver the best travel experiences to the widest set of travelers all over the world 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale afford the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an expanding supply portfolio and create opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technologies very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration  today the majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we believe mobile bookings via smartphones present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are often completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods 

  

during the last few years customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop in addition we ae seeing increasing crossdevice usage among our customers who connect ot our websites and apps across multiple devices and platforms throughout their travel planning process we also believe in the future mobile is likely to represent an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition increase in share of wallet and in repeat customers particularly through mobile applications during 2014 more than one in five expedia inc transactions was booked globally on a mobile device 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel products including merchant and agency hotel is recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago are experienced in the second half of the year as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we aggressively market during the busy booking period for summer travel as a result revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those 

  

amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom welcome rewards program and our brand expedia expedia rewards program welcome rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on expediacom and expediaca as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if so we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the 

  

likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy and other taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the blackscholes option valuation model we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many 

  

factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy and other taxes 

we are currently involved in thirty lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 

  

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 62 million as of december 31 2014 and 46 million as of december 31 2013 it is also reasonably possible that amounts paid in connection with the settlement or adjudication of these issues could include up to an additional 30 million relating to interest payments in one jurisdiction 

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina minnesota and oregon the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions including to the state of new york south carolina north carolina minnesota the district of columbia and the city of new york as well as certain other county and local jurisdictions 

paytoplay 

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we continue to defend our position vigorously 

hawaii tax court litigation general excise tax on january 31 2011 the online travel companies received final notices from the hawaii department of taxation of assessment for general excise taxes for the tax years 2000 to 2011 on their services relating to noncommissioned hotel room reservations the companies appealed these assessments on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that the online travel companies are 

  

obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on both the amount paid to the online travel companies for their services and the amount paid to the hotel for the room thus subjecting the hotel’s charge for the room to double taxation because general excise taxes on the hotel room had already been paid for all of the years at issue the online travel companies have appealed the tax court ruling the hawaii supreme court accepted review and heard oral argument on october 2 2014 

on may 20 2013 the department of taxation issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies for noncommissioned hotel reservations totaling 205 million for the tax year 2012 on june 17 2013 the online travel companies appealed these assessments to the hawaii tax court on december 13 2013 the tax court held proceedings in abeyance pending review and decision by the hawaii supreme court on the prior assessments 

on december 9 2013 the department of taxation issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars totaling 292 million for the tax years 2000 through 2012 these assessments include a duplicative assessment for expedia and hotelscom totaling 93 million and thus are overstated the online travel companies appealed the assessments to the hawaii tax court on march 12 2014 the online travel companies requested that the tax court stay consideration of these assessments pending the decision by the hawaii supreme court relating to the department of taxation’s claimed right to taxes for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel room reservations on april 28 2014 the tax court granted the online travel companies’ request that the court stay consideration of the department of taxation’s car rental assessments pending a decision by the hawaii supreme court 

on july 18 2014 the department of taxation issued final general excise tax assessments totaling 285 million against the expedia companies for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to hotel reservations and car rental for the tax year 2013 the expedia companies contested these assessments and requested additional information from the department of taxation regarding the basis for the amounts assessed on december 22 2014 the tax court stayed consideration of these assessments pending review and decision by the hawaii supreme court on prior assessments 

as a precondition to appealing the tax court rulings in the hawaii excise tax proceedings the expedia companies were required pay an amount equal to taxes penalties and interest during 2012 we expensed 110 million and during 2013 we expensed an additional 64 million for amounts required or expected to be paid prior to appealing the tax court’s ruling the total amount paid by the expedia companies in 2013 was 171 million which was comprised of 78 million in taxes 41 million in penalties and 52 million in interest the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the paytoplay payments made and our estimates of additional assessments mentioned above 

san francisco litigation during 2009 we paid 48 million in advance of litigation relating to occupancy tax proceedings with the city of san francisco the city of san francisco subsequently issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the online travel companies including against expedia hotelscom and hotwire the additional assessments including the prepayment of such assessments were contested by the expedia companies on the basis that the court has already ruled that taxes are not due from the online travel companies and that binding precedent by the california court of appeals precludes the city’s claim for taxes although the city initially agreed subject to documentation that the additional assessments need not be paid and could be placed under a bond it subsequently sought to collect the additional assessment against the expedia companies on may 14 2014 the court heard oral argument on the expedia companies’ contest of the prepayment requirement for the additional assessments and held that the expedia companies were required to prepay in order to litigate the legality of the assessments on may 26 2014 the expedia companies paid 255 million under protest in order to contest the additional assessments the additional assessments were expensed during the second quarter of 2014 on august 6 2014 the california court of appeals stayed this case pending review and decision by the california supreme court of the city of san diego california litigation 

  

other jurisdictions in december 2014 the city of portland and multnomah county oregon assessed certain online travel companies including expedia hotelscom and hotwire for hotel occupancy taxes for the period october 7 2013 to december 31 2014 based on recent amendments to state legislation on january 9 2015 as a precondition to challenging the assessments the expedia companies paid 23 million under protest in alleged taxes penalties and interest we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with domestic and foreign jurisdiction some of which impose a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court 

if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

segments 

we have two reportable segments leisure and egencia our leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia affiliate network hotwirecom wotif group venere elong trivago and classic vacations our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily driven by 26 growth in hotel room nights and 28 increase in air tickets the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by 23 growth in hotel room nights and 9 increase in air tickets 

  

revenue margin decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenue per room night partially offset by the growth in advertising and media revenue revenue margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a favorable mix shift to our higher margin products including hotel revenue as well as advertising and media revenue partially offset by lower revenue per room night on our hotel product the increase in revenue margin related to advertising and media revenue is primarily due to the 2013 acquisition of trivago a metasearch company which does not have associated gross bookings however trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin 

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 in 2014 revenue increased primarily due to growth in hotel and advertising and media revenue in 2013 revenue increased primarily due to an increase in worldwide hotel revenue as well as advertising and media revenue within our leisure segment acquisitions added approximately 1 and 5 to the yearoveryear growth rates in total revenue for 2014 and 2013 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 18 in 2014 primarily due to a 26 increase in room nights stayed driven by brand expedia and hotelscom partially offset by a 6 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased primarily due to efforts to expand the size and availability of the global hotel supply portfolio as well as promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs this decline was partially offset by a 2 increase in adrs in 2014 compared to 2013 revenue per room night is expected to continue to decline in 2015 in addition adrs are expected to be negative yearoveryear in 2015 primarily due to foreign exchange worldwide hotel revenue increased 15 in 2013 primarily due to a 23 increase in room nights stayed driven by elong brand expedia and hotelscom partially offset by a 7 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased primarily due to efforts to expand inventory availability as well as our global supply portfolio including contracts signed as part of our etp program continued hotel mix shift to asiapacific and promotional activities such as couponing and growing our loyalty programs’ membership 

worldwide air revenue increased 22 in 2014 primarily due to a 28 increase in air tickets sold partially offset by a 5 decrease in revenue per air ticket air tickets sold growth was primarily driven by brand expedia including the travelocitybranded websites worldwide air revenue increased 14 in 2013 primarily due to a 9 increase in air tickets sold and 4 increase in revenue per air ticket the increase in air tickets sold primarily relates to growth at brand expedia and egencia 

the remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services and fees related to our corporate travel business increased by 29 in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to strong growth in advertising and media revenue as well as growth in our travel insurance and car rental products the remaining worldwide revenue increased by 37 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily through strong growth in advertising and media revenue generated by the trivago acquisition growth in fees related to our corporate travel business as a result of the via travel acquisition as well as an increase in insurance revenue 

  

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

 the increase in merchant revenue in 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the increase in merchant hotel revenue driven by an increase in room nights stayed 

the increase in agency revenue in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in agency hotel and air the increase in agency revenue in 2013 was primarily due to growth in our agency hotel business corporate travel business as well as an increase in agency air revenue

in 2014 the increase in cost of revenue expense was driven by 56 million of higher net credit card processing costs including fraud and charge backs related to growth of our merchant bookings as well as 55 million increases in customer operations expenses primarily due to an increase in transaction costs and volumes period over period 

in 2013 the increase in cost of revenue expense was primarily driven by higher net credit card processing costs including fraud and charge backs of 77 million related to our merchant bookings in addition higher customer operations expenses drove an additional 36 million of the increase driven in large part by higher headcount costs related to our via travel acquisition 

  

selling and marketing

selling and marketing expenses increased 612 million in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by increase of 542 million in direct costs including online and offline marketing expenses brand expedia including commissions related to the travelocity agreement trivago and hotelscom accounted for the majority of the total direct cost increase in addition higher personnel expenses of 70 million also contributed to the increase and were driven by the ramping up of hiring in the lodging supply organization which is expected to continue into 2015 and additional personnel at trivago and certain of our core ota brands as well as a higher incentive compensation accrual acquisitions added approximately 2 to yearonyear selling and marketing expense growth 

selling and marketing expenses increased 475 million in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by increases in direct costs of 413 million including online and offline marketing expenses trivago brand expedia and hotelscom accounted for the majority of the total direct cost increases in addition higher personnel expenses of 62 million also contributed to the increase and were driven by the addition of trivago headcount as well as increased headcount across our lodging supply organization elong and other leisure brands acquisitions primarily trivago added approximately 9 to yearonyear selling and marketing expense growth 

technology and content 

 

 technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

technology and content expense increased 108 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets of 51 million as well as increased personnel and 

  

overhead costs net of capitalized salary costs of 46 million for additional personnel to support key technology projects for brand expedia elong our corporate technology function and trivago as well as a higher incentive compensation accrual 

the yearoveryear increase in technology and content expense of 93 million in 2013 was primarily due to higher personnel costs net of capitalized salary costs of 34 million for additional headcount to support key technology project for our corporate technology function brand expedia and supply organization as well as increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets of 44 million 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation

in 2013 the 32 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel and overhead expenses of 22 million of which additional headcount drove the majority of the total increase in addition professional fees and other increased 10 million in 2013 driven in large part by higher professional fees acquisitions added approximately 3 to the yearonyear general and administrative expense growth 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 in 2014 amortization increased 8 million compared to 2013 primarily due to amortization related to new business acquisitions partially offset by the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets 

in 2013 amortization increased 40 million compared to 2012 due to amortization related to new business acquisitions including trivago in march 2013 in addition amortization included an approximate 3 million impairment loss related to an indefinitelived trade name in our leisure segment 

  

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 

 

 legal reserves occupancy tax and other consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2014 we recognized approximately 255 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the san francisco occupancy tax proceedings during 2013 we recognized 64 million for amounts paid or expected to be paid in advance of litigation primarily related to penalties and interest in connection with hawaii’s general excise tax litigation during 2012 we recognized 110 million related to monies expected to be paid in advance of litigation related to hawaii’s general excise tax litigation for additional information see note 17 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring and related reorganization charges 

in conjunction with the migration of technology platforms and centralization of technology supply and other operations primarily related to acquisition integration including wotif group we recognized 26 million in restructuring charges during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2014 these charges were primarily related to severance and related benefits as well as an australian stamp duty tax that is payable to certain australian jurisdictions related to business restructuring events we expect an additional 10 million to 15 million of restructuring charges most of which we expect to occur in the first half of 2015 for additional information see note 15 — restructuring and related reorganization charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitionrelated and other 

during 2013 we recorded approximately 57 million of stockbased compensation to acquisitionrelated and other expense in connection with the trivago acquisition as well as 10 million related to the upfront consideration paid to settle a portion of an employee compensation plan of trivago for additional information see note 3 — acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating income 

 

 in 2014 operating income increased due to the growth in revenue acquisitionrelated and other expenses in 2013 that did not recur and lower legal reserve occupancy tax and other charges in the current year partially offset by restructuring and related reorganization charges in 2014 

in 2013 operating income decreased primarily due to increased costs and expense in excess of revenue as described above partially offset by the growth in revenue and lower charges related to the hawaii excise tax litigation 

  

interest income and expense 

 

 interest income increased in 2014 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalent and investment balances interest income decreased slightly in 2013 primarily due to lower average cash cash equivalent and investment balances 

interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of additional interest on the 500 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2014 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 provision for income taxes 

 

 the decrease in the effective rate for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2001 through 2005 federal tax years and the associated release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as well as nondeductible stockbased compensation recorded related to the trivago acquisition and nondeductible penalties included in the hawaii paytoplay assessments in 2013 our effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower as well as the release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 

the increase in the effective rate for 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to recording a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of certain australian and chinese entities in 2013 compared to the releasing of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of certain french entities in 2012 as well as nondeductible charges in 2013 in connection with the trivago acquisition and hawaii paytoplay assessments mentioned above in 2013 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states partially offset by the factors affecting yearoveryear comparability 

in 2012 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states as well as the release of a valuation allowance at certain french entities 

  

discontinued operations net of taxes 

on december 20 2011 following the close of trading on the nasdaq stock market we completed the spinoff of tripadvisor which consisted of the domestic and international operations previously associated with our tripadvisor media group to expedia stockholders during 2012 we incurred a loss from early extinguishment of our 85 senior notes due 2016 the “85 notes” resulting directly from the spinoff of tripadvisor the pretax loss was approximately 38 million or 24 million net of tax which included an early redemption premium of 33 million and the writeoff of 5 million of unamortized debt issuance and discount costs this loss was recorded within discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2012 as that was the period in which the 85 notes were legally extinguished 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 18 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 including 369 million and 360 million of cash and shortterm investment balances held in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries which includes 190 million and 226 million related to earnings indefinitely invested outside the united states as well as 304 million and 319 million of majorityowned subsidiaries which is also indefinitely invested outside the united states and our 1 billion revolving credit facility cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states totaled 916 million as of december 31 2014 to date we have permanently reinvested the majority of these foreign earnings outside of the united states and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to us income taxes 

as of december 31 2014 we maintained a 1 billion revolving credit facility of which 985 million was available this represents the total 1 billion facility less 15 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” the revolving credit facility was amended in september 2014 to extend the maturity date to september 2019 the facility bears interest based on the company’s credit ratings with drawn amounts bearing interest at libor plus 150 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 20 basis points as of december 31 2014 

in august 2014 we registered 500 million of senior unsecured notes that are due in august 2024 and bear interest at 45 the “45 notes” the 45 notes were issued at 99444 of par resulting in a discount which will be amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in february and august of each year beginning february 15 2015 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2014 moody’s rating was ba1 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt which was comprised of 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2018 that bear interest at 7456 750 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 that bear interest at 595 and 500 million in registered senior unsecured notes due in august 2024 that bear interest at 45 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are 

  

liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to our other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel advertising or certain expedia affiliate network relationships or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers such as with mobile bookings via smartphones our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed 

for example we have continued to see positive momentum in the global roll out of the etp program launched in 2012 as this program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling up of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow relative liquidity during the transition and hotel revenue margins 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns as well as changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp may counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2014 we had a deficit in our working capital of 13 billion compared to a deficit of 11 billion as of december 31 2013 the change in deficit is primarily due to use of cash for financing and investing activities including business acquisitions and share repurchases partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 500 million 45 notes issued in august 2014 and cash generated by operations during 2014 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements in infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt our capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to increase in comparison to 2014 spending levels 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

   

in 2014 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by 604 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization as well as lower paytoplay tax assessment payments in the current year in 2013 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by 474 million primarily due to lower benefits from working capital resulting from a decrease in the rate of growth in our merchant hotel business compared to the prior year a working capital detriment due to changes in nonmerchant accounts payable as well as an increase in general excise tax assessments and income tax payments 

in 2014 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased 398 million primarily due to net purchases of investments of 32 million in the current period compared to cash provided by net sales and maturities of investments of 286 million in 2013 as well as a cash outflow of 5 million due to the net settlement of foreign currency forwards compared to a cash inflow of 41 million in the prior year in 2013 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased 158 million primarily due to an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 342 million an increase in capital expenditures of 73 million which includes a 50 ownership interest in an aircraft for which we paid 25 million partially offset by 286 million of cash provided by net sales of investments in 2013 compared to 82 million in 2012 as well as higher cash provided by the net settlement of currency forwards of 54 million 

on january 23 2015 we acquired the travelocity brand and other associated assets from sabre for 280 million in cash as a result of the acquisition the strategic marketing and other related agreements previously entered into during 2013 were terminated 

cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2014 primarily included 493 million of net proceeds for the issuance of 45 notes in august 2014 and 129 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 538 million including the repurchased shares under the 2012 authorization discussed below and 85 million cash dividend payment cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2013 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 523 million including the repurchased shares under the 2012 authorization discussed below as well as 76 million cash dividend payments partially offset by 82 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans as well as the issuance of treasury stock cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2012 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of 418 million including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below as well as 130 million cash dividend payments partially offset by 241 million of proceeds from the exercise of equity awards including the warrants discussed below 

during 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during each of the respective years for a total of 60 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 

 

  

 as of december 31 2014 18 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2012 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases subsequent to the end of the year we repurchased an additional 05 million shares for a total cost of 44 million excluding transaction costs representing an average purchase price of 8525 per share on february 4 2015 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock 

  

our common stock dividend was 066 per share for 2014 056 per share for 2013 and 096 per share for 2012 see note 13 — stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition on february 4 2015 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 018 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 26 2015 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10 2015 future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

during 2012 we issued 80 million shares of expedia inc common stock as a result of the exercise of 32 million privately held warrants at a weighted average exercise price of 2391 for total proceeds to the company of approximately 191 million as of december 31 2013 and 2014 we did not have any warrants outstanding 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2014 showed a net change of 78 million reflecting higher depreciation in foreign currencies in the current year compared to the prior year the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2013 showed a net change of 46 million reflecting lower foreigndenominated cash balances and depreciation in most currencies 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2014

other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2014 

certain relationships and related party transactions 

as a result of changes in the ownership and governance structures of tripadvisor inc that occurred during 2012 and 2013 as previously disclosed we will no longer separately disclose transactions with tripadvisor in our financial statements as related party transactions 




 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2014 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 45 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes 595 notes and 45 notes were approximately 581 million 840 million and 504 million as of december 31 2014 as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 9 million our 595 notes by approximately 20 million and our 45 notes by approximately 20 million 

we maintain a 1 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we invest in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2014 we had 143 million of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in bond prices would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately 1 million as of december 31 2014  such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

  

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 or 2012 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had a net forward asset of 9 million and 2 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 1 million based on our foreign currency forward positions excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2014 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 we recorded net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately 6 million 14 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 1 million 13 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and 16 million 7 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades they each operate a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched new global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands most recently expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded sites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own a 

  

majority share of elong which is the second largest online travel company in china we also own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in europe egencia our corporate travel business operates in more than 60 countries around the world and continues to expand including its 2012 acquisition of via travel we also partner in a 5050 joint venture with airasia — a low cost carrier serving the asiapacific region — to jointly grow an online travel agency business although the results for the joint venture are not consolidated in our financial statements we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy in 2013 approximately 44 of our worldwide gross bookings and 47 of worldwide revenue were international points of sale up from 22 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a stated goal of driving more than half of our revenue through international points of sale 

during march 2013 we completed our majority acquisition of trivago a leading hotel metasearch company officially launched in 2005 trivago is already one of the best known travel brands in europe trivago will continue to operate independently and plans to rapidly grow revenue through global expansion including aggressive expansion into the united states and canada 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale affords the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an increasingly larger supply portfolio and creates opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technology very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration  today the vast majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we believe mobile bookings via smartphones present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are typically completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last year customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop we also believe mobile will represent an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition and repeat customers particularly through mobile applications we have a stated goal of booking 20 of our transactions through mobile devices before the end of 2014 

merchant and agency business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under both models we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers under the merchant model we are the merchant of record under the agency model the travel supplier is the merchant of record during 2012 we introduced the expedia traveler preference “etp” program that enables much closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant offering specifically for participating hotels we will be able to offer customers the choice of whether to pay expedia in advance expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect 

for transactions where we act as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we generally negotiate supply allocation and 

  

pricing with our suppliers which often enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model today the majority of our merchant revenue primarily relates to hotel bookings as part of the introduction of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs therefore the global rollout of etp has negatively impacted the margin of revenue we earn per booking and we expect will continue to do so in the future in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering and continue to roll out etp we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions based on these dynamics we expect our revenue per room night to remain under pressure in the future 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed primarily using the merchant model 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed via a proprietary extranet 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and 

  

strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner as well as our ability to attract repeat customers to our sites 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media sites such as facebook and twitter offline advertising loyalty programs and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships our traveler loyalty programs include welcome rewards on hotelscom global websites and expedia rewards on expediacom the cost of these two loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia or hotelscom cobranded offering or a private label website our ean business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide on range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

operations and technology 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador and egypt we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services search engines such as google and bing and certain travel metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate 

  

demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property rights in our content brands software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

  

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

additionally we are subject to consumer protection data privacy and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry some of these laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our various business models

 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

  

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 online travel agencies we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies in many regions such as priceline and its regional brands travelocity orbitz as well as other regional competitors such as ctrip in china which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in particular we have faced and are facing intense global competition from priceline subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

search engines we also face increasing competition from search engines like google bing and yahoo search to the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning shopping or booking capabilities or increasingly refer those leads to suppliers directly or other favored partners increase the cost of traffic directed to our websites or offer the ability to make transactions on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example since 2011 these search engines increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content comparable to otas to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our websites or websites in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivagobranded websites compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

  

travel metasearch engines and content aggregators travel metasearch websites including kayakcom a subsidiary of priceline trivago a majorityowned subsidiary of expedia and qunar in china as well as travel research sites that have search functionality such as tripadvisor aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites in addition some metasearch sites such as kayakcom tripadvisor and qunar in china offer consumers the ability to make reservations directly on their websites to the extent metasearch websites limit our participation within their search results or consumers utilize the metasearch website for travel services instead of ours our trafficgenerating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner or we may be required to increase our marketing costs to maintain market share either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition as a result of our acquisition of a majority ownership interest in trivago we also now compete more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue to the extent that trivago’s ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites is hampered whether due to its affiliation with us or otherwise trivago’s business and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our investment in trivago could be negatively impacted 

corporate travel providers egencia our fullservice corporate travel management company competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services some of these competitors may have more financial resources greater name recognition wellestablished client bases or a broader global presence which may make it difficult for us to retain or attract new corporate travel clients 

mobile platform travel applications mobile platforms including smartphones and tablet computers have rapidly emerged and are continuing to grow significantly the emergence and improved functionality of mobile platforms has led to an increased use by consumers of standalone applications to research and book travel if we are unable to offer innovative userfriendly featurerich mobile applications for our travel services along with effective marketing and advertising or if our mobile applications are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected 

social media websites social media websites including facebookcom continue to develop search functionality for data included within its website which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers resulting in additional competition from new competitors 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 

increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and we may be required to modify our current business models and practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position and performance 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in emerging markets such as metasearch developing products for new platforms such as mobile or offering new optionalities such as our expedia traveler preference initiative these endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives inadequate return on investments these initiatives may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs increase the risk of payment delays andor 

  

nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers as well as limiting our ability to develop new site innovations these new initiatives may therefore not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

for example during 2012 expedia introduced the etp program to hotel suppliers in the united states and europe and is now in the process of rolling the program out globally etp offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay as part of the introduction of etp we reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs therefore the global rollout of etp has begun to negatively impact the margin of revenue we earn per booking and will continue to do so in the future in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering and continue to roll out etp we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions each of which may also negatively impact the margin of revenue we earn per booking in the future depending on relative supplier and traveler adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the introduction of etp could also negatively impact our near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines including google frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google travel metasearch engines including kayak and internet media properties including tripadvisor pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can experience rapid change both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place lower in search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

for example beginning in 2008 domestic and global economic conditions deteriorated rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slowed spending on the services we provide and had a negative impact on our revenue growth more recently during 2012 several eurozone countries experienced deteriorating credit and economic conditions which and also resulted in significant devaluation of the euro relative to other currencies such as the us dollar which in turn had a negative impact on our eurodenominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance current sovereign debt and economic issues 

  

in several european countries the recent shutdown of the us government worry over extending the debt ceiling in the united states and concern about the impact of the pullback in the us federal reserve’s quantitative easing program are all examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and average daily rates “adrs” decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have recently experienced for example the significant decline in adrs which began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue in addition adrs on our websites in both 2008 and 2009 declined faster than in the overall travel industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels to the extent adrs decline in the future our hotel booking revenue may be negatively impacted 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that travel suppliers or gds partners will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to implement multiple costly direct connections charge travel agencies for or otherwise restrict access to content credit card fees or other services further reduce their adrs or decide not to make their travel inventory available to us any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance for example a number of airlines now charge for checked baggage food beverages and other services gdss currently have limited technology to incorporate these elements into 

  

our product selection impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines own sites or other channels that show this content detail in late 2010 american airlines began to pursue a new distribution strategy requiring online travel agents to agree to connect directly to american airlines’ systems rather than through gdss if other airlines pursue a similar distribution strategy it could reduce our access to air inventory reduce our compensation result in additional operating expenses related to the development implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology systems increase the frequency or duration of system problems and delay other projects 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors including increased spending from our competitors promotional and discounting activities the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among our multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers for example during 2013 bookingcom trivago and tripadvisor launched offline advertising campaigns in the united states for the first time thus increasing the number of participants in the travel advertising space increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue and expand globally in the future we are also pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm market share growth opportunities in certain markets which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall marketing efficiency 

our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover successful branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings the emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies for such platforms have and will continue to require new and costly investments in technology we may not be successful or less successful than our current or new competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple technologies and platforms and that is appealing to consumers either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as service providers could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs 

  

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits these migrations have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site innovations in addition during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

a large and growing portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence as we have expanded globally our international nonus revenue increased from 39 in 2010 to 47 in 2013 in foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes as we enter countries and markets that are new to us we must tailor our services and business models to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be complex difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices systems processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which has increased our costs and instances of fraud certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as our revenues from these markets grow over time 

in addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are subject to particular risks and uncertainties relating to our operations in china which we conduct primarily through elong which is a leading online travel service provider in china and is a separately listed company on nasdaq the success of elong and of our other current and future business and investments in china is subject to commercial risks relating to the highly dynamic and increasingly competitive market in china our business and investments in china are also subject to numerous risks and significant uncertainties regarding the application development and interpretation of china’s laws and regulations which could limit the legal protections available to us moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in areas such as the travel industry the internet and online commerce foreign investment taxation labor and foreign currency exchange in addition chinese law restricts foreign investment in areas including airticketing travel agency internet content provision and telecommunications and requires certain licenses and permits related to our business to be held by legal entities owned by prc citizens or chineseowned companies rather than our subsidiaries although we have established effective control over such chinese entities through a series of agreements future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could adversely affect our control over and the operations of our businesses in china capitalization of our chinese entities is also subject to regulation and there can be no assurance that we can provide adequate financing for these entities or repatriate cash balances and investments china also does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have such treaties may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china as we are the controlling shareholder of elong we may also be subject to legal or regulatory investigations or claims relating to any alleged improper conduct or violations of us law nasdaq or sec regulations or other applicable law or regulations by elong which may result in significant costs fines or penalties being assessed against elong and us in early 2014 an sec administrative law judge issued an initial decision censuring certain chinese audit firms including elong’s external auditor for failing to comply with document requests from the sec and suspending such firms from practicing before the sec for six months the firms in question have indicated that they intend to appeal and the decision and the suspension will not become effective until the resolution of any such appeal in addition the public company accounting oversight board or “pcaob” may choose to administer sanctions or take other actions against chinese audit firms including elong’s auditor due to the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of audit firms in china if chinese audit firms including elong’s external auditor are suspended or otherwise unable to practice before the sec or maintain registration with the pcaob elong may be unable to meet the ongoing reporting requirements under the exchange act which may ultimately result in elong’s delisting from nasdaq 

  

adverse application of existing tax or unclaimed property laws rules or regulations or implementation of new unfavorable laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

the application of various domestic and international transactional taxes such as sales use occupancy valueadded payroll excise and other tax or unclaimed property laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable authorities which authorities may become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time whether as a result of economic pressures or otherwise while we believe that we are compliant with current tax provisions the applicable authorities may take a contrary position and such positions may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax or other laws rules and regulations were amended if new unfavorable laws rules or regulations were adopted as has recently occurred in certain jurisdictions or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes or unclaimed property the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively subject us to interest and penalties decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical and administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decide not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions as a result these changes could have an adverse effect on our businesses or financial performance 

a number of authorities have brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy or other taxes in addition we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments which may be substantial prior to contesting the validity of tax assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes for example during 2009 we paid 48 million in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the city of san francisco the city of san francisco has also issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the travel companies including 22 million against expedia hotelscom and hotwire during 2013 we paid 171 million in advance of litigation in general excise tax proceedings in the state of hawaii the state of hawaii has also issued additional assessments for general excise tax penalties and interest against the online travel companies including 404 million against expedia hotelscom and hotwire excluding duplicative assessments hotelscom is currently under audit by the state of texas there is a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse audit result in court 

we continue to work with relevant authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection securities laws and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and expensive if these legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance or results of operations 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel licensing the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection competition and privacy unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities affect our margins increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

we also have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection competition and travel industryspecific laws and regulations the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements 

the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations or the new interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

for example in july 2012 the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” the competition authority in the united kingdom issued a statement of objections alleging that expedia and bookingcom entered into separate agreements with intercontinental hotels group plc “ihg” that restricted each online travel company’s ability to discount the price of ihg hotel rooms the oft limited its investigation to a small number of companies but has stated that the investigation is likely to have wider implications for the industry within the united kingdom the parties have proposed to address the oft’s concerns by offering commitments and on january 31 2014 the oft announced that it had formally accepted the commitments offered by the parties with no finding of fault or liability the commitments provide the parties to the oft’s case ie ihg bookingcom and expedia with the right to provide nonpublic discounts on the rate offered for room only hotel accommodation bookings at uk hotels to eligible european economic area resident members of the parties’ membership programs which must meet certain minimum criteria in addition the commitments require expedia and bookingcom to modify their “most favored nations” clauses as relevant so as not to apply to any discounting activities described in the preceding sentence the commitments will be binding on the parties through january 31 2016 since july 2012 more than thirty putative class action lawsuits which refer to the oft’s statement of objections have been initiated in the united states by consumer plaintiffs alleging claims against the online travel companies including expedia and several major hotel chains for alleged resale price maintenance for online hotel room reservations the cases have been consolidated and are currently pending in federal court 

in addition a number of competition authorities in other european countries have initiated investigations into competitive practices within the travel industry and in particular in relation to most favored nations clauses 

  

and other contractual arrangements between hotels and online travel companies including expedia these investigations differ from the oft investigation and also differ in relation to the parties involved and the precise nature of the concerns if we are required to significantly modify or eliminate any most favored nation clauses in our arrangements with hotels we may not be able to offer our consumers with competitive pricing as being offered by other ota 

we are unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

the determination of our worldwide tax provision for income taxes is subject to significant judgment and a number of factors could have a material effect on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are various transactions and calculations including intercompany transactions and crossjurisdictional transfer pricing for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation we are regularly audited by us and foreign tax authorities which authorities may become more aggressive in their interpretation of applicable laws rules and regulations over time whether as a result of economic pressures or otherwise tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the final determination of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn an increasing portion of our income and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions repatriation of funds currently held by our subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions may result in a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments in addition there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate the carrying value of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could affect our profitability our effective tax rate in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process 

we are subject to paymentsrelated risks including credit card fraud 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions the volume of which are very large and continue to grow for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition or for certain companies at their discretion an imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

our results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites or other payment disputes with our customers or otherwise experience increased levels of disputed credit card payments accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes which have become increasingly common and sophisticated may be 

  

negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms including smartphones and tablet computers and our global expansion including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity if we are unable to effectively combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites or if we otherwise experience increased levels of disputed credit card payments our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we are accumulating a greater portion of our cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings would likely result in additional us income tax expense in 

  

addition we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continued to see positive momentum in our global roll out of the etp program launched in 2012 as this program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier and traveler adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon — including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers — and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other 

  

member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty interactive corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty interactive corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 58 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2013 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty interactive corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that mr diller and mr kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that 

  

any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

we work closely with various business partners and rely on thirdparties for many systems and services and therefore could be harmed by their activities 

we could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control we work closely with business partners including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures and through our expedia affiliate network business we also rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these partners or thirdparty service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities it could damage our reputation make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business or expose us to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance likewise if the thirdparty service providers on which we rely were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2013 we held cash in bank depository accounts of 616 million primarily in bank of america hsbc and jpmorgan chase and held time deposits of approximately 131 million at financial institutions including australia and new zealand banking group nordea and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of 45 million primarily in deutsche bank industrial and commercial bank of china china construction bank china merchants bank and bank of china and held time deposits of approximately 283 million at financial institutions including industrial and commercial bank of china china merchants bank bank of china and bank of communications as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2013 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 282 million the fair value of which was approximately 2 million the counterparties to these contracts were credit suisse international standard chartered bank goldman sachs bank jpmorgan chase bank of america us bank barclays bank plc bnp paribas and hsbc we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts 

in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar japanese yen nordic currencies and brazilian real 

  

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management and also plan to change data sources and execution methods we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

we process store and use personal information and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations and potential liability related to security breaches 

we may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in the company which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online in addition the european union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business there can be no guarantee that our existing 

  

security measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate user information or proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations in the past we have experienced “denialofservice” type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites unavailable for short periods of time as well as unauthorized access of our systems and data we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for their own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance finally countries in other regions most notably asia and latin america are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted 

acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on our business are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2013 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 12 billion risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

our discretion in the operation of our business is limited by certain factors including various covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness these covenants also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses 

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites rely on content brands and technology much of which is proprietary we protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secret laws patents and confidentiality agreements in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information even with these precautions it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

other tax litigation 

hawaii tax court litigation general excise tax  on january 31 2011 the online travel companies received final notices of assessment for general excise taxes for the tax years 2000 to 2011 on their services relating to noncommissioned hotel room reservations the companies appealed these assessments to the hawaii tax court on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that the online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on both the amount paid to the online travel companies for their services and the amount paid to the hotel for the room thus subjecting the hotel’s charge for the room to double taxation because general excise taxes on the hotel room had already been paid for all of the years at issue on march 15 2013 the hawaii tax court issued penalties against the online travel companies for their failure to file returns and pay general excise taxes on august 12 2013 the court further held that interest is due on such penalties during the pendency of the tax court proceeding the online travel companies petitioned the hawaii supreme court for immediate review of the tax court’s january 11 2013 ruling holding the companies liable for general excise tax the hawaii supreme court denied the online travel companies’ petition on april 22 2013 the tax court proceeding subsequently concluded and on september 11 2013 the online travel companies filed their notice of appeal on december 24 2013 the hawaii supreme court agreed to accept transfer and review of the case the case will now proceed in front of the hawaii supreme court for review and will not be considered by the hawaii court of appeals we strongly believe that the tax court ruling regarding the general excise tax is 

  

contrary to the plain language of the ordinances at issue as well as prior hawaiian supreme court decisions previous positions taken by the hawaii director of taxation and an opinion by the attorney general of the state of hawaii we intend to vigorously pursue our rights on appeal the department of taxation has dismissed without prejudice its common law claims for the recovery of general excise taxes 

as a precondition to appealing the tax court rulings the expedia companies were required to pay an amount equal to taxes penalties and interest this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to the taxes in question to the extent our appeal is successful in reducing or eliminating the assessed amounts the state of hawaii would be required to repay such amounts plus interest the total amount that the expedia companies paid in 2013 to appeal the tax court ruling was 171 million compromised of 78 million in taxes 41 million in penalties and 52 million in interest the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded and our estimates of possible penalties and additional assessments 

in addition on may 20 2013 the department of taxation issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the expedia companies for noncommissioned hotel reservations totaling 205 million for the tax year 2012 on june 17 2013 the online travel companies appealed these assessments to the hawaii tax court on december 13 2013 the tax court held proceedings in abeyance pending review and decision by the hawaii supreme court on the prior assessments 

on december 9 2013 the department of taxation also issued final assessments for general excise taxes against the online travel companies for noncommissioned travel agency services relating to rental cars totaling 292 million for the years 2000 to 2012 these assessments include a duplicative assessment for expedia and hotelscom totaling 93 million and thus are overstated on january 7 2013 the online travel companies appealed the assessments to the hawaii tax court

hotel booking practices proceedings and litigation 

matters relating to hotel booking practices  on july 31 2012 the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” issued a statement of objections alleging that expedia bookingcom bv and intercontinental hotels group plc “ihg” have infringed european union and united kingdom competition law in relation to the online supply of hotel room accommodations the statement of objections alleges that expedia and bookingcom entered into separate agreements with ihg that restricted each online travel company’s ability to discount the price of ihg hotel rooms the oft limited its investigation to a small number of companies but stated that the investigation was likely to have wider implications for the industry within the united kingdom the statement of objections does not constitute a finding of infringement and all parties have the opportunity to respond if the oft were to maintain its objections after the companies’ responses the oft could issue a final decision an appeal of an adverse oft decision is to the english courts but may involve a reference on matters of european union law to the european court of justice 

the parties have not formally responded to the statement of objections but have instead voluntarily proposed to address the oft’s investigation by offering formal commitments on august 9 2013 the oft opened a consultation on the companies’ proposed commitments the public consultation period ended on september 13 2013 after further revision to the formal commitments a second public consultation was held and concluded on january 17 2014 on january 31 2014 the oft announced that it had formally accepted the commitments offered by the parties with no finding of fault or liability the commitments provide online travel 

  

companies with the right to provide nonpublic discounts on the rate offered for room only hotel accommodation bookings at uk hotels to eligible european economic area resident members of the online travel companies’ closed groups the commitments also clarify the hotels’ rights to offer discounts under the same conditions to members of their closed groups in addition the commitments require online travel agencies to modify their most favored nation clauses as relevant so as not to apply to any discounting activities covered by the commitments the commitments are binding on the parties through january 31 2016 

in addition a number of competition authorities in other european countries have initiated investigations into competitive practices within the travel industry and in particular in relation to most favored nation clauses and other contractual arrangements between hotels and online travel companies including expedia these investigations differ from the oft investigation in relation to the parties involved and the precise nature of the concerns we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of these investigations and their impact if any on our business and results of operations 

since august 20 2012 more than thirty putative class action lawsuits which refer to the oft’s statement of objections have been initiated in the united states by consumer plaintiffs alleging claims against the online travel companies including expedia and several major hotel chains for alleged resale price maintenance for online hotel room reservations including but not limited to violation of the sherman act state antitrust laws state consumer protection statutes and common law tort claims such as unjust enrichment the cases have been consolidated and transferred to judge boyle in the united states district court for the northern district of texas on may 1 2013 the plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint on july 1 2013 the defendants filed motions to dismiss that complaint a hearing on the defendants’ motions to dismiss took place on december 17 2013

summary of the spinoff of tripadvisor 

on december 20 2011 following the close of trading on the nasdaq stock market we completed the spinoff of tripadvisor which consisted of the domestic and international operations previously associated with our tripadvisor media group to expedia stockholders immediately prior to the spinoff expedia effected a onefortwo reverse stock split 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into various agreements with tripadvisor a related party at that time due to common ownership including among others a separation agreement a tax sharing agreement an employee matters agreement a transition services agreement and various commercial agreements in addition we have continued to work together with tripadvisor pursuant to commercial agreements dated november 1 2013 between subsidiaries of expedia on the one hand and subsidiaries of tripadvisor on the other hand 

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2012 and 2013 have represented years of gradual improvement for the travel industry however natural disasters sovereign debt and economic issues in several european countries the recent shutdown of the us government worry over extending the debt ceiling in the united states and concern about the impact of the pullback in the us federal reserve’s quantitative easing program are all examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2013 approximately 61 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occur online compared with approximately 50 of european travel online penetration in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are lagging behind that of europe and are estimated to be approximately 27 and 21 respectively these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom which pricelinecom acquired in may 2013 trivagocom in which expedia acquired a 

  

majority ownership interest in march 2013 as well as tripadvisor completed its conversion to a metasearch site in june 2013 introduced differentiated features pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies finally we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google and microsoft 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in europe expedia has both a merchant and an agency hotel offer for our hotel supply partners and we expect our use of these models to continue to evolve during 2012 expedia introduced the etp program to hotel suppliers in the united states and europe and is now in the process of rolling the program out globally etp offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition has also historically led to aggressive online marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins during 2013 bookingcom trivago and tripadvisor launched offline advertising campaigns in the united states for the first time thus increasing the number of participants in the travel advertising space increasing competition for share of voice and we expect this activity to continue in the future we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis at the local or regional level making decisions in each market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is lower than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive the crowded online travel environment is now driving secondary and tertiary online travel companies to establish marketing agreements with global players in order to leverage distribution and technology capabilities while focusing resources on capturing consumer mind share 

hotel 

we generate the majority of our revenue through the marketing and distribution of hotel rooms standalone and package bookings although our relationships with our hotel supply partners have remained broadly stable in the past few years as part of the global rollout of etp we have reduced negotiated economics in certain instances to compensate for hotel supply partners absorbing expenses such as credit card fees and customer service costs which has begun to negatively impact the margin of revenue we earn per booking in addition as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering we have made and expect to continue to make adjustments to our economics in various geographies including changes based on local market conditions lastly we have seen a higher mix of our room night growth coming from markets such as china where our hotel margins are lower and we have implemented new customer loyalty and discount programs based on these dynamics our average revenue per room night has declined each quarter in 2012 and 2013 and we expect it to remain under pressure in the future all of these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last several years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry have generally increased in a gradually improving overall travel environment currently occupancy rates are near 2007 peaks and there is very little new net hotel supply being added in the us lodging market with large chains focusing their development opportunities in international markets this may help hoteliers with their objective of continuing to grow adrs and could lead to pressure in negotiations with hoteliers and may ultimately lead to pressure on terms for us and our ota competitors in international markets hotel supply is being added at a much faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as china and india among others we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with more than 260000 hotels on our global websites including 

  

elong as of december 31 2013 in addition our room night growth has been healthy with room nights growing 18 in 2011 27 in 2012 and 23 in 2013 adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites grew 5 in 2011 declined 2 in 2012 and were essentially flat in 2013 

air 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil in recent years there has been increased air carrier consolidation generally resulting in lower overall capacity and higher fares in addition air carriers have made significant efforts to keep seat capacity relatively low in order to ensure that demand for seats remains high and that flights are as full as possible reduced seating capacities are generally negative for expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers ticket prices on expedia sites increased 1 in 2013 4 in 2012 and 11 in 2011 we have encountered pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew and as air carriers and gds intermediaries renegotiate their longterm agreements in addition some us air carriers introduced various incentives for customers to book directly with the carrier versus via online travel agencies examples of these incentives include lower fees advance seat assignments and greater earning potential for frequent flier miles 

in part as a result of sharply rising average ticket prices our ticket volumes decreased by 8 in 2011 after having grown by 11 in 2010 air ticket volumes grew 9 in 2013 and 7 in 2012 largely due to strong growth in corporate ticket volumes at egencia in addition in the second half of 2013 brand expedia saw improved ticket volume growth which we believe is due in part to implementation of a new air technology platform and the related product enhancements from a product perspective in 2013 72 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with 8 of our revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we believe that the hotel product is the most profitable of the products we distribute and represents our best overall growth opportunity 

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades they each operate a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technical platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched new global platforms for hotelscom and brand expedia enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle thereby improving conversion and driving faster growth rates for those brands most recently expedia signed an agreement to power the technology supply and customer service platforms for travelocitybranded sites in the united states and canada enabling expedia to leverage its investments in each of these key areas we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own a majority share of elong which is the second largest online travel company in china we also own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in europe egencia our corporate travel business operates in more than 60 countries around the world and continues to expand including its 2012 acquisition of via travel we also partner in a 5050 joint venture with airasia — a low cost carrier serving the asiapacific region — to jointly grow an online travel agency business although the results for the joint venture are not consolidated in our financial statements we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy in 2013 approximately 44 of our worldwide gross bookings and 47 of worldwide revenue were international points of sale up from 22 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a stated goal of driving more than half of our revenue through international points of sale 

  

during 2013 we completed our majority acquisition of trivago a leading hotel metasearch company officially launched in 2005 trivago is already one of the best known travel brands in europe trivago will continue to operate independently and plans to rapidly grow revenue through global expansion including aggressive expansion into the united states and canada 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale affords the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an increasingly larger supply portfolio and creates opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technology very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration  today the vast majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we believe mobile bookings via smartphones present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are typically completed within one or two days of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last year customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop we also believe mobile represents an efficient marketing channel given the opportunity for direct traffic acquisition and repeat customers particularly through mobile applications we have a stated goal of booking 20 of our transactions through mobile devices before the end of 2014 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue for most of our travel products including merchant and agency hotel is recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes and the more stable nature of our fixed costs furthermore operating profits for our primary advertising business trivago are experienced in the second half of the year as selling and marketing costs offset revenue in the first half of the year as we aggressively market during the busy booking period for summer travel as a result revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally 

  

accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom welcome rewards program and our expediacom expedia rewards tm  welcome rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on expediacom as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if so we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

  

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and 

  

timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

  

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the blackscholes option valuation model we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy taxes 

we are currently involved in thirtyfive lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 46 million as of december 31 2013 which includes amounts expected to be paid in connection with the developments described above and 35 million as of december 31 2012 

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission by the taxpayer that it believes it is subject to such taxes during 2009 we expensed 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings with the city of san francisco the city of san francisco subsequently issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the online travel companies including 24 million against expedia hotelscom and hotwire the additional assessments including the prepayment of such assessments have been contested by the online travel companies the city previously agreed subject to documentation that the second assessment need not be paid and could be placed under a bond the city now has stated that it intends to proceed with an administrative process outside of litigation and will seek to collect the 24 million assessment against the expedia companies the expedia companies will seek injunctive and other relief to block the continuation of the administrative process for these assessments that are already the subject of a court proceeding in 2010 the expedia companies made a pay to play payment to the city of santa monica the online travel companies prevailed in that case and the payment to santa monica by the expedia companies totaling 3 million was returned by the city hotelscom is currently under audit by the state of texas which imposes a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse audit result in court 

  

we do not believe that the amounts we retain as compensation are subject to the cities’ hotel occupancy tax ordinances if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts plus interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina minnesota and oregon the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy we are currently remitting taxes to the city of new york the state of new york the state and local jurisdictions of south carolina the state of minnesota the district of columbia the state and local jurisdictions of georgia anne arundel maryland and the state of north carolina and durham county north carolina 

hawaii tax court litigation general excise tax on january 31 2011 the online travel companies received final notices from the hawaii department of taxation of assessment for general excise taxes for the tax years 2000 to 2011 on their services relating to noncommissioned hotel room reservations the companies appealed these assessments on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that the online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest on both the amount paid to the online travel companies for their services and the amount paid to the hotel for the room thus subjecting the hotel’s charge for the room to double taxation because general excise taxes on the hotel room had already been paid for all of the years at issue for additional information on these legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

as a precondition to appealing the tax court rulings the expedia companies were required to paytoplay an amount equal to taxes penalties and interest payment of these amounts if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to the taxes in question to the extent our appeal is successful in reducing or eliminating the assessed amounts the state of hawaii would be required to repay such amounts plus interest the total amount that the expedia companies paid in 2013 to appeal the tax court ruling was 171 million which is comprised of 78 million in taxes 41 million in penalties and 52 million in interest 

during 2012 we expensed 110 million and during 2013 we expensed an additional 64 million for amounts required or expected to be paid prior to appealing the tax court’s ruling it is reasonably possible that we will incur amounts in excess of the amounts expensed in 2012 and 2013 which we estimate could be up to 38 million after consideration of additional outstanding assessments the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded and our estimates of additional assessments 

segments 

we have two reportable segments leisure and egencia our leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia affiliate network hotwirecom venere elong trivago and classic vacations our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

  

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by 23 growth in hotel room nights and 9 increase in air tickets the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily driven by 27 growth in hotel room nights and 7 increase in air tickets 

revenue margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a favorable mix shift to our higher margin products including hotel revenue as well as advertising and media revenue partially offset by lower revenue per room night on our hotel product the increase in revenue margin related to advertising and media revenue is primarily due to the 2013 acquisition of trivago a metasearch company which does not have associated gross bookings however trivago is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin revenue margin remained relatively consistent for 2012 compared to 2011 

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 in 2013 revenue increased primarily due to an increase in worldwide hotel revenue as well as advertising and media revenue within our leisure segment in 2012 revenue increased primarily due to an increase in worldwide hotel revenue acquisitions added approximately 5 and 2 to the yearoveryear growth rates in total revenue for 2013 and 2012 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 15 in 2013 primarily due to a 23 increase in room nights stayed driven by elong brand expedia and hotelscom partially offset by a 7 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased primarily due to efforts to expand inventory availability as well as our global supply portfolio including contracts signed as part of our etp program continued hotel mix shift to asiapacific and promotional activities such as couponing and growing our loyalty programs’ membership worldwide hotel revenue increased 20 in 2012 primarily due to a 27 increase in room nights stayed partially offset by a 5 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased in 2012 primarily due to changes in our hotel product mix of which mix shift to regions with lower hotel economics was becoming a significant component 

  

worldwide air revenue increased 14 in 2013 primarily due to a 9 increase in air tickets sold and 4 increase in revenue per air ticket the increase in air tickets sold primarily relates to growth at brand expedia and egencia worldwide air revenue decreased 8 in 2012 due to a 14 decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by a 7 increase in air tickets sold the increase in air tickets sold primarily relates to the via travel acquisition and was partially offset by volume pressure associated with a 4 increase in average ticket prices revenue per air ticket declined in 2012 primarily due to lower net supplier economics partially offset by consumer and interline booking fees 

the remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services and fees related to our corporate travel business increased by 37 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily through strong growth in advertising and media revenue generated by the trivago acquisition growth in fees related to our corporate travel business as a result of the via travel acquisition as well as an increase in insurance revenue the remaining worldwide revenue increased by 20 in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily through strong growth in corporate travel fees primarily due to the via travel acquisition as well as an increase in advertising and media and insurance revenue 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

 the increase in merchant revenue in 2013 and 2012 was due to an increase in hotel revenue primarily driven by an increase in room nights stayed 

the increase in agency revenue in 2013 was primarily due to growth in our agency hotel business corporate travel business as well as an increase in agency air revenue the increase in agency revenue in 2012 was primarily due to growth in our corporate travel business and agency hotel business partially offset by a decline in agency air revenue 

the increase in advertising and media revenue in 2013 was primarily due to revenue generated by trivago 

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors 2 credit card processing including merchant fees charge backs and fraud and 3 other costs primarily including data center costs to support our websites destination supply and stockbased compensation 

  

in 2013 the increase in cost of revenue expense was primarily driven by higher net credit card processing costs including fraud and charge backs of 77 million related to our merchant bookings in addition higher customer operations expenses drove an additional 38 million of the increase driven in large part by higher headcount costs related to our via travel acquisition 

in 2012 the increase in cost of revenue expense was primarily driven by an increase of 78 million in customer operations expenses of which higher headcount costs related to our via travel acquisition as well as our global customer organizations accounted for approximately 80 of the total increase as well as 40 million in higher credit card processing costs net of credit card rebates related to our merchant bookings growth 

selling and marketing 

 

 selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our various leisure brands global supply organization and egencia as well as stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses increased 475 million in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by increases in direct costs of 415 million including online and offline marketing expenses trivago brand expedia and hotelscom accounted for the majority of the total direct cost increases in addition higher personnel expenses of 60 million also contributed to the increase and were driven by the addition of trivago headcount as well as increased headcount across our lodging supply organization elong and other leisure brands acquisitions primarily trivago added approximately 9 to yearonyear selling and marketing expense growth 

selling and marketing expenses increased 246 million in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by increases in direct costs of 188 million including online marketing and mobile download spend at hotelscom and brand expedia as well as higher affiliate marketing expenses at ean and higher personnel expenses of 58 million driven by additional headcount across our supply organization and several brands 

technology and content 

 

 technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of 

  

our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

the yearoveryear increase in technology and content expense of 93 million in 2013 and 104 million in 2012 was primarily due to higher personnel costs net of capitalized salary costs of 45 million and 63 million for additional headcount to support key technology project for our corporate technology function brand expedia and supply organization as well as increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets of 42 million and 32 million 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation 

in 2013 the 32 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel and overhead expenses of 22 million of which additional headcount drove the majority of the total increase in addition professional fees and other increased 10 million in 2013 driven in large part by higher professional fees acquisitions added approximately 3 to the yearonyear general and administrative expense growth in 2012 the 35 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel and overhead expenses of 36 million including bonus accruals and additional headcount and higher legal fees of 5 million partially offset by 9 million of lower consulting fees 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 in 2013 amortization increased compared to 2012 due to amortization related to new business acquisitions including trivago in march 2013 in addition amortization included an approximate 3 million impairment loss related to an indefinitelived trade name in our leisure segment in 2012 amortization increased compared to 2011 due primarily to amortization related to the via travel acquisition 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 

 

   

legal reserves occupancy tax and other consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2013 we recognized 64 million for amounts paid or expected to be paid in advance of litigation primarily related to penalties and interest in connection with hawaii’s general excise tax litigation during 2012 we recognized 110 million related to monies expected to be paid in advance of litigation related to hawaii’s general excise tax litigation for additional information see note 16 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

acquisitionrelated and other 

during 2013 we recorded approximately 57 million of stockbased compensation to acquisitionrelated and other expense in connection with the trivago acquisition as well as 10 million related to the upfront consideration paid to settle a portion of an employee compensation plan of trivago for additional information see note 3 – acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating income 

 

 in 2013 operating income decreased primarily due to increased costs and expenses in excess of revenue as described above partially offset by the growth in revenue and lower charges related to the hawaii excise tax litigation 

in 2012 operating income decreased primarily due to increased costs and expenses in excess of revenue as described above including the hawaii tax assessments in 2012 partially offset by the growth in revenue 

interest income and expense 

 

 interest income decreased slightly in 2013 primarily due to lower average cash cash equivalent and investment balances interest income increased in 2012 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalent and investment balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return on those balances 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

   

provision for income taxes 

 

 the increase in the effective rate for 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily due to recording a valuation allowance related to foreign deferred tax assets in 2013 compared to the releasing of a valuation allowance related to foreign deferred tax assets in 2012 as well as nondeductible charges in 2013 in connection with the trivago acquisition and hawaii paytoplay assessments mentioned above in 2013 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states predominately switzerland where our statutory income tax rate is lower partially offset by the factors affecting yearoveryear comparability 

the decrease in the effective rate for 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily related to an increase in earnings as a percentage of total earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states as well the release of the valuation allowance related to foreign deferred tax assets in 2012 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states as well as the release of a valuation allowance 

in 2011 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states 

discontinued operations net of taxes 

on december 20 2011 following the close of trading on the nasdaq stock market we completed the spinoff of tripadvisor which consisted of the domestic and international operations previously associated with our tripadvisor media group to expedia stockholders during 2012 we incurred a loss from early extinguishment of our 85 senior notes due 2016 the “85 notes” resulting directly from the spinoff of tripadvisor the pretax loss was approximately 38 million or 24 million net of tax which included an early redemption premium of 33 million and the writeoff of 5 million of unamortized debt issuance and discount costs this loss was recorded within discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2012 as that was the period in which the 85 notes were legally extinguished 

discontinued operations also include the results of operations of tripadvisor for 2011 through spinoff on december 20 2011 in addition discontinued operations in 2011 include the reclassification of expense related to the obligation to fund a charitable foundation that was assumed by tripadvisor in conjunction with the spinoff and interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount related to the redemption of the 85 notes in connection with the spinoff for additional information see note 4 — discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 13 billion and 19 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 including 226 million and 160 million of cash and shortterm investment balances held in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries related to earnings indefinitely invested outside the united states as well as 319 million and 309 million of majorityowned subsidiaries most of which is also indefinitely invested outside the united states and our 1 billion revolving credit facility cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states totaled 794 million as of december 31 2013 to date we have permanently reinvested the majority of these foreign earnings 

  

outside of the united states and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to us income taxes 

as of december 31 2013 we maintained a 1 billion revolving credit facility of which 981 million was available this represents the total 1 billion facility less 19 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” the revolving credit facility expires in november 2017 and bears interest based on the company’s credit ratings with drawn amounts bearing interest at libor plus 150 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 20 basis points as of december 31 2013 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies as of december 31 2013 moody’s rating was ba1 with an outlook of “stable” sp’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” and fitch’s rating was bbb with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we generally pay after the travelers’ use and in some cases subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we are using both the merchant model and the agency model in many of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel or advertising or if there are changes to the merchant model supplier payment terms or booking patterns that compress the time period between our receipt of cash from travelers and our payment to suppliers such as with mobile bookings via smartphones our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed 

for example we have continued to see positive momentum in our global roll out of the etp program launched in 2012 as this program continues to expand and depending on relative traveler and supplier adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the scaling of etp has and will continue to negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow relative liquidity during the transition and hotel revenue margins 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns as well as changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp may counteract or intensify these anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2013 we had a deficit in our working capital of 11 billion compared to a deficit of 368 million as of december 31 2012 the change in deficit is primarily due to financing and investing activities including business acquisitions and share repurchases partially offset by cash generated by operations during 2013 

  

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements in infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions including purchases of noncontrolling interest share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt our capital expenditures for 2014 are expected to be broadly in line to below 2013 spending levels 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 in 2013 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by 474 million primarily due to lower benefits from working capital resulting from a decrease in the rate of growth in our merchant hotel business compared to the prior year a working capital detriment due to changes in nonmerchant accounts payable as well as an increase in general excise tax assessments and income tax payments in 2012 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by 411 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes 

in 2013 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased 158 million primarily due to an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 342 million an increase in capital expenditures of 73 million which includes a 50 ownership interest in an aircraft for which we paid 25 million partially offset by 286 million of cash provided by net sales of investments in 2013 compared to 82 million in 2012 as well as higher cash provided by the net settlement of currency forwards of 54 million in 2012 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations represented a positive change of 95 million primarily due to 82 million of cash provided by net sales of investments in 2012 compared to 216 million of cash used in the net purchases of investment in 2011 partially offset by an increase of cash used for acquisitions of 164 million and higher capital expenditures of 28 million in 2012

during 2012 2010 and 2006 our board of directors or the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during each of the respective years for a total of 60 million shares shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows 

 

  

  as of december 31 2013 88 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2012 authorization with no fixed termination date for the repurchases subsequent to the end of the year we repurchased an additional 07 million shares for a total cost of 46 million excluding transaction costs representing an average purchase price of 6668 per share 

our common stock dividend was 056 per share for 2013 096 per share for 2012 and 056 per share for 2011 which has been adjusted for the onefortwo reverse stock split on december 20 2011 see note 13 — stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of the quarterly dividend payments by year in addition on february 5 2014 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share of outstanding common stock payable on march 27 2014 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 10 2014 future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

during 2012 we issued 80 million shares of expedia inc common stock as a result of the exercise of 32 million privately held warrants at a weighted average exercise price of 2391 for total proceeds to the company of approximately 191 million as of december 31 2013 we did not have any warrants outstanding 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2013 showed a net change of 46 million reflecting lower foreigndenominated cash balances in the current year and depreciation in most currencies the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2012 showed a net change of 33 million reflecting higher foreigndenominated cash balances in the current year and appreciation in currencies 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

  

interest rate risk 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes and 595 notes were approximately 587 million and 816 million as of december 31 2013 as calculated based on quoted market prices in less active markets at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 12 million and our 595 notes by approximately 22 million 

we maintain a 1 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we invest in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2013 we had 200 million of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in bond prices would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately 2 million as of december 31 2013  such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 or 2011 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had a net forward asset of 2 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of 3 million included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign 

  

currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 4 million based on our foreign currency forward positions excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2013 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2013 2012 and 2011 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately 1 million 13 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 16 million 7 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and 8 million 5 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale affords the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an increasingly larger supply portfolio and creates opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technology very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration  today the vast majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends in 2010 we bought a leading travel application company called mobiata ® which is responsible for several top travel applications such as flighttrack tm  flighttrack pro tm and flightboard tm  and is now integrated into brand expedia we believe mobile bookings present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are typically completed within one day of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last year customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop we have a stated goal of booking 20 of our transactions through mobile devices before the end of 2014 

virtually all of our leisure brands continue to conduct experiments with ‘daily deals’ and social media as part of our efforts to drive business through new distribution channels we believe daily deals may represent incremental travel bookings as it typically represents an impulse purchase compared to historical travel purchasing activity which tends to be a highly considered and deliberate transaction in addition we anticipate the importance of social media channels to consumers and to our industry to increase over time it is our intention to grow our ‘social’ efforts alongside this trend 

merchant and agency business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under both models we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers under the merchant model we are the merchant of record under the agency model the travel supplier is the merchant of record during 2012 we introduced the expedia traveler preference “etp” program that enables much closer integration of the agency hotel product with our core merchant offering specifically for participating hotels we will be able to offer customers the choice of whether to pay expedia in advance expedia collect or pay at the hotel at the time of the stay hotel collect 

for transactions where we act as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers which often enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model today the majority of our merchant revenue primarily relates to hotel bookings as we rollout the etp program globally we believe it will likely drive faster growth in our agency hotel business which could result in our blended hotel margins trending down over time through the introduction of the etp program we expect any distinction between the “agencymodel” and the “merchantmodel” to blur over time 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages 

  

assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites primarily include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their other models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers we expect the package product to continue to be marketed using the merchant model even with the planned global rollout of the etp program 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed via a proprietary extranet 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre and to a lesser extent amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media sites such as facebook and twitter offline advertising loyalty programs and direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier 

  

relationships our traveler loyalty programs include welcome rewards ® on hotelscom global websites and expedia rewards on expediacom the cost of these two loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through a brand expedia or hotelscom cobranded offering or a private label website our ean business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide on range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

operations and technology 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador and egypt we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that are focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services search engines such as google and bing and certain travel metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car 

  

companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property rights in our content brands software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties 

we protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents or tour operators in those markets including in some countries pricing display requirements licensing and registration requirements 

  

mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions industry specific valueadded tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

additionally we are subject to consumer protection and competition laws and regulations around the world that are not specific to the travel industry some of these laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements relate to our various business models

 part i item 1a   risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

  

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 online travel agencies we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies in many regions such as priceline and its regional brands travelocity orbitz as well as other regional competitors such as ctrip in china which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in particular we have faced and are facing intense global competition from priceline subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 

travel suppliers some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

search engines we also face increasing competition from search engines like google bing and yahoo search to the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities or increasingly refer those leads to suppliers directly or other favored partners or offer the ability to make transactions on their own website there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example during 2011 google completed its acquisition of flight search technology company ita software and launched a new beta product called google flights in which ota results are not included and separately made changes to its hotel search results to promote their own products to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected our websites or websites in which we hold a significant ownership position including trivagobranded websites if we consummate our agreement to acquire a significant majority interest in trivago compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

  

travel metasearch engines and content aggregators travel metasearch websites including kayakcom which entered into a merger agreement with pricelinecom in november 2012 and trivagocom in which expedia has agreed to acquire a majority ownership interest and travel research sites that have search functionality such as tripadvisor aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other websites if these competitors limit our participation within their results it could affect our trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner in addition some metasearch sites such as kayakcom offer users the ability to make hotel reservations directly on their websites 

social media websites and mobile platform travel applications in recent years social media websites including facebookcom mobile platforms including smartphones and tablet computers have emerged and are growing significantly the emergence of mobile platforms has lead increasing use by consumers of standalone applications to research and book travel in addition facebook has recently launched enhanced search functionality for data included within its website which may in the future develop into an alternative research resource for travelers 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

beginning in 2008 domestic and global economic conditions deteriorated rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slowed spending on the services we provide and had a negative impact on our revenue growth further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance more recently during 2012 several eurozone countries experienced deteriorating credit and economic conditions which resulted in significant devaluation of the euro relative to other currencies such as the us dollar and it is possible that certain eurozone countries could leave the euro currency in the future which could adversely impact our eurodenominated net assets gross bookings revenues operating expenses and net income as expressed in us dollars 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply occupancy and average daily rates “adrs” decreases in airline capacity periodically rising airline ticket prices or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities all of which we have recently experienced for example the significant decline in adrs which began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue in addition adrs on our websites in both 2008 and 2009 declined faster than in the overall travel industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels to the extent adrs decline in the future our hotel booking revenue may be negatively impacted 

other factors that could negatively affect our business include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers in particular hotel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that travel suppliers or gds partners will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to implement multiple costly direct connections charge travel agencies for or otherwise restrict access to content credit card fees or other services further reduce their adrs or decide not to make their travel inventory available to us any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance for example a number of airlines now charge for checked baggage food beverages and other services gdss currently have limited technology to incorporate these elements into our product selection impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines own sites or other channels that show this content detail in late 2010 american airlines began to pursue a new distribution strategy requiring online travel agents to agree to connect directly to american airlines’ systems rather than through gdss if other airlines pursue a similar distribution strategy it could reduce our access to air inventory reduce our compensation result in additional operating expenses related to the development implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology systems increase the frequency or duration of system problems and delay other projects 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will increase due to a variety of factors including increased spending from our competitors the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among our multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and 

  

even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover successful branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications reservations customer service communications procurement payments fraud detection and administration as our operations grow in size scope and complexity we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 

our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings the emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies for such platforms have and will continue to require new and costly investments in technology we may not be successful or less successful than our competitors in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple technologies and platforms which would negatively impact our business and financial performance new developments in other areas such as cloud computing and software as service providers could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs 

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort which we expect to continue for several more years to migrate key portions of our consumer affiliate and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits these migrations have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site innovations in addition during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines including google frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on search engines including google travel metasearch engines including kayak and internet media properties including tripadvisor pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can experience rapid change both technically and competitively moreover a search or metasearch engine could for competitive or other 

  

purposes alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place lower in search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent 

the industry in which we operate is dynamic and we may be required to modify our current business models and practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position and performance 

we continue to adapt our business to remain competitive including investing in emerging markets such as metasearch developing products for new platforms such as mobile or offering new optionalities such as our expedia traveler preference initiative these endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations expenses associated with the initiatives inadequate return on investments these initiatives may require significant investments including changes to our financial systems and processes which could significantly increase our costs increase the risk of payment delays andor nonpayments of amounts owed to us from our supplier partners and customers as well as limiting our ability to develop new site innovations these new initiatives may therefore not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results 

for example during 2012 we began implementing the etp initiative with our hotel supply partners and expect to continue implementation during 2013 and beyond etp offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay depending on relative supplier and traveler adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the introduction of etp could negatively impact our near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time liquidity and the margin of revenue we earn per booking 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence in these foreign jurisdictions we face complex dynamic and varied risk landscapes to achieve widespread acceptance as we enter countries and markets that are new to us we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices internal systems and processes and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth for example to compete in certain international markets we have in the past and may in the future adopt locallypreferred payment methods which may increase our costs and risk of fraud 

in addition to the risks outlined in elsewhere in this section our international operations are also subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are subject to particular risks and uncertainties relating to our operations in china which are primarily through elong which is the second largest online travel service provider in china and is a separately listed company on nasdaq the success of this business and of any future investments we make in china is subject to commercial risks relating to the highly competitive market in china as well as to risks and uncertainties regarding the application development and interpretation of china’s laws and regulations significant uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws and regulations including permits and license requirements and such uncertainties could limit the available legal protections relating to our investments moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet and online commerce media foreign investment taxation labor and currency exchange and regulation including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict foreign investment in areas including airticketing travel agency internet content provision mobile communication and related businesses although we have established effective control through a series of agreements between the companies in which our chinese investments are held and their affiliated chinese entities future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to control operate or restructure these entities or to engage in strategic transactions capitalization of our chinese entities is also subject to extensive government oversight and regulation and there can be no assurance that we can provide adequate financing for these entities or provide for the successful repatriation of cash balances and investments finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china 

  

adverse application of existing tax or unclaimed property laws rules or regulations or implementation of new unfavorable laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

the application of various domestic and international transactional taxes such as sales use occupancy valueadded payroll excise and other tax or unclaimed property laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable authorities which authorities may become more aggressive in their interpretation andor enforcement of such laws rules and regulations over time whether as a result of economic pressures or otherwise while we believe that we are compliant with current tax provisions the applicable authorities may take a contrary position and such positions may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax or other laws rules and regulations were amended if new unfavorable laws rules or regulations were adopted as has recently occurred in certain jurisdictions or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes or unclaimed property the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively subject us to interest and penalties decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer result in increased costs to update or expand our technical and administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of our business activities if we decide not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance 

a number of authorities have brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy or other taxes in addition we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments which may be substantial prior to contesting the validity of tax assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes for example during 2009 we expensed 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the city of san francisco the city of san francisco has also issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the travel companies including 22 million against expedia hotelscom and hotwire in january 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that we were are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest which the director of taxation has claimed totals 110 million comprised of 78 million relating to tax liability and 32 million in interest for the expedia subsidiaries additional penalties of up to 50 of the tax liability may also be imposed the state may seek to require us to pay an amount equal to the taxes interest and penalties if any prior to appealing the court’s ruling hotelscom is currently under audit by the state of texas there is a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse audit result in court 

we continue to work with relevant authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights antitrust consumer protection and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and expensive if these legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

  

the determination of our worldwide tax provision for income taxes is subject to significant judgment and a number of factors could have a material effect on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are various transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation we are regularly audited by us and foreign tax authorities which authorities may become more aggressive in their interpretation of applicable laws rules and regulations over time whether as a result of economic pressures or otherwise although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the final determination of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn an increasing portion of our income and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions repatriation of funds currently held by our subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions may result in a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments in addition recent legislative proposals would significantly alter the manner in which us companies are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material effect on our effective tax rate and cash tax payments 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we are accumulating a greater portion of our cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings would likely result in additional us income tax expense in addition we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we have also started introducing our etp initiative which depending on adoption rates and customer behavior could result in a significant shift to agency hotel transactions and therefore may negatively impact our near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time and liquidity 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

  

a failure to comply with current laws rules and regulations or changes to such laws rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial performance or results of operations 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to travel licensing the internet and online commerce internet advertising and price display consumer protection competition and privacy unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there are and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet display of certain taxes and fees online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services would require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and client relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

we have been subject and we will likely be subject in the future to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection competition and travel industryspecific laws and regulations the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations further if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market our compliance with such laws may put us a competitive disadvantage visàvis competitors who do not comply with such requirements 

for example in july 2012 the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” the competition authority in the united kingdom issued a statement of objections alleging that expedia and bookingcom entered into separate agreements with intercontinental hotels group plc “ihg” that restricted each online travel company’s ability to discount the price of ihg hotel rooms the oft limited its investigation to a small number of companies but has stated that the investigation is likely to have wider implications for the industry within the united kingdom since july 2012 twentyone putative class action lawsuits which refer to the oft’s statement of objections have been initiated in the united states by consumer plaintiffs alleging claims against the online travel companies including expedia and several major hotel chains for alleged resale price maintenance for online hotel room reservations in addition a number of competition authorities in other european countries have initiated investigations in relation to certain contractual arrangements between hotels and online travel companies including expedia these investigations differ in relation to the parties involved and the precise nature of the concerns the cases are currently pending in multiple federal and state courts we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the oft’s investigation and the impact if any on our business and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon – including multiple colocation providers for data centers cloud computing providers for application hosting and network access providers – and network 

  

access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial positions 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition or for certain companies at their discretion an imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

we may also be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites or other payment disputes with our customers accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs our ability to detect and combat increasingly sophisticated fraudulent schemes may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods the emergence of new technology platforms such a smartphones and tablet computers and our expansion into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity if we are unable to effectively combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty interactive corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty interactive corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 57 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2012 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty interactive corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals 

  

or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac or tripadvisor on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac also messrs diller kaufman and khosrowshahi each serve on the board of directors of tripadvisor the fact that messrs diller and kaufman and mr khosrowshahi with respect to tripadvisor hold positions with and securities of these companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia or both tripadvisor and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac or of tripadvisor will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac or tripadvisor instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac or tripadvisor this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac or tripadvisor instead of expedia 

we rely on thirdparties for many systems and services 

we rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these thirdparties experience difficulty or fail to meet our requirements or standards or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business in addition if such thirdparty service providers were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our bank deposits and investments foreign exchange risk management insurance coverages and letters of credit as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2012 we held cash in bank depository accounts of 480 million primarily in bank of america hsbc and jpmorgan chase and held time deposits of approximately 350 million at financial institutions including bank of tokyomitsubishi barclays bnp paribas hsbc national australia bank nordea royal bank of scotland and 

  

sumitomo mitsui banking corporation additionally majorityowned subsidiaries held cash of 45 million primarily in citibank jpmorgan chase and merrill lynch and held time deposits of approximately 274 million at financial institutions including bank of communications bank of china china construction bank citibank china merchants bank and icbc as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2012 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 667 million the fair value of which was approximately 3 million the counterparties to these contracts were barclays bank of tokyomitsubishi jpmorgan chase bnp paribas royal bank of scotland goldman sachs bank us bank and hsbc we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts 

in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2012 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 12 billion risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

our discretion in the operation of our business is limited by certain factors including various covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness these covenants also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses 

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

our ability to engage in significant stock transactions could be limited or restricted after our spinoff of tripadvisor inc in december 2011 in order to preserve the tax free nature of the spinoff to expedia current us federal income tax law limits our ability during the twoyear period following the spinoff to enter into certain transactions that might be advantageous to us and our stockholders particularly issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs repurchasing equity securities and under certain limited circumstances acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities or agreeing to be acquired 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar japanese yen and chinese renminbi 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in addition an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems accurate and reliable data sources controls and change management procedures in the event our estimates differ significantly from actual results or if we fail to adopt effective hedging processes we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

  

we process store and use personal information and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations and potential liability related to security breaches 

we may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in the company which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online in addition the european union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance 

potential security breaches to our systems or the systems of our service providers whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business there can be no guarantee that our existing security measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate user information or proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations in the past we have experienced “denialofservice” type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites unavailable for short periods of time as well as unauthorized access of our systems and data we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for their own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

acquisitions and investments could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired or invested in a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions and investments any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions and investments that may have a material impact on our business are 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites rely on content brands and technology much of which is proprietary we protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secret laws patents and confidentiality agreements in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information even with these precautions it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and 

  

scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

other tax litigation 

hawaii tax court litigation general excise tax  on november 7 2012 the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether the online travel companies are liable for payment of hawaii’s general excise tax on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest which the director of taxation has claimed totals 110 million comprised of 78 million relating to tax liability from january 2000 to december 2011 and 32 million in interest from january 2000 to december 2012 for expedia hotelscom and hotwire “the expedia subsidiaries” in a hearing on march 8 2013 the court will determine the amount if any of penalties which the director of taxation has asserted should be 50 of the tax liability for the expedia subsidiaries the final assessed amount will remain uncertain until such time as the court has resolved these issues during the year ended december 31 2012 we accrued 110 million which is our best estimate of the probable amount we will 

  

pay prior to appealing the court’s ruling it is also reasonably possible that we will be required to pay penalties and an additional assessment for 2012 and other items which we estimate could be up to 60 million the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded and our estimates of possible penalties and additional assessments 

we strongly believe the court ruling regarding the general excise tax is contrary to the plain language of the ordinances at issue as well as prior hawaiian supreme court decisions previous positions taken by the hawaii director of taxation and an opinion by the attorney general of the state of hawaii we intend to vigorously pursue our rights on appeal it is likely that the state will seek to require us to pay an amount equal to the taxes and interest prior to appealing the court’s ruling this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to the taxes in question to the extent our appeal is successful in reducing or eliminating the assessed amounts the state of hawaii would be required to repay such amounts plus interest 

the state also has asserted common law claims for the recovery of general excise taxes and the online travel companies have moved to dismiss the state’s common law claims the court has set a hearing for february 22 2013 to consider the online travel companies’ motion to dismiss these claims trial on any remaining issues is scheduled for april 13 2013

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2012 represented a year of gradual improvement for the travel industry however natural disasters such as hurricane sandy that impacted the northeast united states ongoing sovereign debt and economic issues in several european countries as well as uncertainty regarding the us debt ceiling all contribute to a somewhat uncertain forward environment for the travel industry 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2012 approximately 59 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occur online compared with approximately 44 of european travel online penetration in the emerging markets such as asia pacific and latin american regions are estimated to be approximately 20 lagging behind that of europe these penetration 

  

rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services and supplier growth outpaced online agency growth for several years competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies including kayakcom which entered into a merger agreement with pricelinecom in november 2012 and trivagocom in which expedia has agreed to acquire a majority ownership interest have in some cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies in addition models such as daily deals and private sale sites have also begun proliferating we have a number of “daily deals” offered on our retail websites as well as a partnership with groupon called groupon getaways with expedia finally we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google and microsoft 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in europe expedia has both a merchant and an agency hotel offer for our hotel supply partners and we expect our use of these models to continue to evolve during 2012 expedia introduced the expedia traveler preference program to hotel suppliers in the united states and europe etp offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay 

intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis at the local or regional level making decisions in each market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases particularly in emerging markets we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is lower than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive 

hotel 

we generate the majority of our revenue through the marketing and distribution of hotel rooms standalone and package bookings our relationships and negotiated total economics with our hotel supply partners have remained broadly stable in the past few years we have however implemented new customer loyalty and discount programs and have eliminated or reduced some fees in that timeframe and as such the margin of revenue we earn per booking has declined in addition the introduction of etp could negatively impact the margin of revenue we earn per booking in the future 

since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis any increase or decrease in average daily rates has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night over the course of the last two years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry have generally improved in a gradually improving overall travel environment currently occupancy rates are near 2007 peaks and there is very little new net hotel supply being added in the us lodging market with large chains focusing their development opportunities in international markets this may help hoteliers with their objective of continuing to grow their adrs and could lead to pressure in negotiations with hoteliers and may ultimately lead to pressure on terms for us and our ota competitors in international markets hotel supply is being added at a much faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as china and india among others we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with almost 200000 hotels on our global websites including elong as of the end of 2012 in addition our room night growth has been healthy with room nights growing 18 in 2011 and 27 in 2012 adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites grew 5 in 2011 while they declined 2 in 2012 

  

air 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil in recent years there has been increased air carrier consolidation generally resulting in lower overall capacity and higher fares in addition air carriers have made significant efforts to keep seat capacity relatively low in order to ensure that demand for seats remains high and that flights are as full as possible reduced seating capacities are generally negative for expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers ticket prices on expedia sites grew 4 and 11 in 2012 and 2011 we are encountering pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew and as air carriers and gds intermediaries renegotiate their longterm agreements in addition some us air carriers introduced various incentives for customers to book directly with the carrier versus via online travel agencies examples of these incentives include lower fees advance seat assignments and greater earning potential for frequent flier miles 

in part as a result of sharply rising average ticket prices our ticket volumes decreased by 8 in 2011 after having grown by 11 in 2010 air ticket volumes grew 7 in 2012 largely due to the acquisition of via travel and air ticket sales of a major us carrier which were absent in the first quarter of 2011 due to a commercial disagreement 

from a product perspective over 74 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with approximately 8 of our revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we believe that the hotel product is the most profitable of the products we distribute and represents our best overall growth opportunity 

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades they each operate a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technological platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched our new hotelscom global platform in the first quarter of 2010 enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle for that brand since then we have been successful in improving conversion and driving much faster growth rates for the hotelscom brand we are in the midst of a similar transformation for brand expedia having rolled out its new hotel platform in the second half of 2011 followed by the air platform rollout during the first half of 2012 with expectations that the new package platform will be completed in 2013 

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own a majority share of elong which is the second largest online travel company in china we also own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in europe egencia our corporate travel business operates in 54 countries around the world and continues to expand including its recent acquisition of via travel we also partner in a 5050 joint venture with airasia – a low cost carrier serving the asia  pacific region – to jointly grow an online travel agency business although the results for the joint venture are not consolidated in our financial statements we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy in 2012 approximately 41 of our worldwide gross bookings and 45 of worldwide revenue were international up from 22 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a stated goal of driving more than half of our revenue through international points of sale 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 

  

we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale affords the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an increasingly larger supply portfolio and creates opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technology very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration today the vast majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobiletablet applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends in 2010 we bought a leading travel application company called mobiata ® which is responsible for several top travel applications such as flighttrack tm  flighttrack pro tm and flightboard tm  and is now integrated into brand expedia we believe mobile bookings present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are typically completed within one day of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods during the last year customers’ behaviors and preferences on tablet devices began to show differences from trends seen on smartphones for example the booking window on a smartphone typically is much shorter than the emerging trend on the tablet device and historical average on a desktop or laptop we have a stated goal of booking 20 of our transactions through mobile devices before the end of 2014 

virtually all of our leisure brands continue to conduct experiments with ‘daily deals’ and social media as part of our efforts to drive business through new distribution channels we believe daily deals may represent incremental travel bookings as it typically represents an impulse purchase compared to historical travel purchasing activity which tends to be a highly considered and deliberate transaction in addition we anticipate the importance of social media channels to consumers and to our industry to increase over time it is our intention to grow our ‘social’ efforts alongside this trend 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the more stable nature of our fixed costs as a result revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial 

  

statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom welcome rewards program and our expediacom expedia rewards tm  welcome rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on expediacom as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if so we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates 

  

the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge as of october 1 2012 and 2011 and as of december 20 2011 the date of the spinoff the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying values 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and 

  

timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

  

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions such as the states of new york north carolina and minnesota the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the blackscholes option valuation model we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy taxes 

we are currently involved in 43 lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part i item 3 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 35 million as of december 31 2012 which includes amounts expected to be paid in connection with the developments described above and 32 million as of december 31 2011 in addition as of december 31 2011 we also accrued 10 million related to court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes 

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission by the taxpayer that it believes it is subject to such taxes during 2009 we expensed 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the city of san francisco the city of san francisco has issued additional assessments of tax penalties and interest for the time period from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011 against the travel companies including 22 million against expedia hotelscom and hotwire the additional assessments including the prepayment of such assessments have been contested by the online companies during 2010 we expensed 3 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the city of santa monica these funds were returned to us by the city in december 2011 in exchange for a letter of credit hotelscom is currently under audit by the state of texas there is a paytoplay requirement to challenge an adverse audit result in court 

we do not believe that the amounts we retain as compensation are subject to the cities’ hotel occupancy tax ordinances if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts plus interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina and minnesota the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy we are currently remitting taxes to the city of new york the state of new york the state and local jurisdictions of south carolina the state of minnesota the district of columbia and the state and local jurisdictions of georgia 

hawaii tax court litigation general excise tax on january 11 2013 the hawaii tax court ruled that online travel companies are obligated to remit past hawaii general excise taxes with interest which the director 

  

of taxation has claimed totals 110 million comprised of 78 million relating to tax liability from january 2000 to december 2011 and 32 million in interest from january 2000 to december 2012 for expedia hotelscom and hotwire “the expedia subsidiaries” in a hearing on march 8 2013 the court will determine the amount if any of penalties which the director of taxation has asserted should be 50 of the tax liability for the expedia subsidiaries the final assessed amount will remain uncertain until such time as the court has resolved these issues it is likely that the state will seek to require us to pay an amount equal to the taxes and interest prior to appealing the court’s ruling during the year ended december 31 2012 we accrued 110 million which is our best estimate of the probable amount we will pay prior to appealing the court’s ruling it is also reasonably possible that we will be required to pay penalties and an additional assessment for 2012 and other items which we estimate could be up to 60 million the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded and our estimates of possible penalties and additional assessments 

segments 

we have two reportable segments leisure and egencia our leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia affiliate network hotwirecom venere elong and classic vacations our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have generally seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily driven by 27 growth in hotel room nights and 7 increase in air tickets the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily driven by 18 growth in hotel room nights and 5 in hotel adrs revenue margin was largely consistent for 2012 compared to 2011 as well as for 2011 compared to 2010 

  

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 in 2012 revenue increased primarily due to an increase in hotel room nights stayed partially offset by a decrease in revenue per room night and revenue per ticket egencia’s acquisition of via travel in the second quarter of 2012 added approximately 2 to yearoveryear growth to total revenue for 2012 in 2011 the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in worldwide hotel revenue within our leisure segment 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 20 in 2012 primarily due to a 27 increase in room nights stayed partially offset by a 5 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased primarily due to changes in our hotel product mix of which mix shift to regions with lower hotel economics is becoming a significant component worldwide hotel revenue increased 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an 18 increase in room nights stayed 

worldwide air revenue decreased 8 in 2012 due to a 14 decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by a 7 increase in air tickets sold the increase in air tickets sold primarily relates to the via travel acquisition and was partially offset by volume pressure associated with a 4 increase in average ticket prices revenue per air ticket declined in 2012 primarily due to lower net supplier economics partially offset by consumer and interline booking fees worldwide air revenue decreased 4 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to an 8 decrease in air tickets sold partially offset by a 4 increase in revenue per air ticket 

the remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes car rental advertising and media destination services and fees related to our corporate travel business increased by 20 in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily through strong growth in corporate travel fees primarily due to the via travel acquisition as well as an increase in advertising and media and insurance revenue the remaining worldwide revenue increased by 8 in 2011 compared to 2010 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

 the increase in merchant revenue in 2012 and 2011 was due to an increase in hotel revenue primarily driven by an increase in room nights stayed 

  

the increase in agency revenue in 2012 and 2011 was primarily due to growth in our corporate travel business and agency hotel business partially offset by a decline in agency air revenue 

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors 2 credit card processing including merchant fees charge backs and fraud and 3 other costs primarily including data center costs to support our websites destination supply and stockbased compensation 

in 2012 the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were higher credit card processing costs related to our merchant bookings growth and higher headcount costs related to our via travel acquisition as well as our global customer and supply operations partially offset by an increase in credit card rebates 

in 2011 the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were higher call and data center costs as well as higher credit card processing costs related to our merchant transaction growth partially offset by credit card rebates 

selling and marketing 

 

 selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our global supply organization egencia and our various leisure brands and stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses increased 246 million in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by increases in online marketing and mobile download spend at hotelscom and brand expedia as well as higher affiliate marketing expenses at ean and higher personnel expenses driven by additional headcount across our supply organization and several brands 

selling and marketing expenses increased 240 million in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by increases in online offline and affiliate marketing expenses as well as higher personnel expenses across most of our brands and supply organization 

  

direct costs include online marketing expenses with tripadvisor of 205 million in 2012 211 million in 2011 and 171 million in 2010 prior to the spinoff these amounts were eliminated but are now included in selling and marketing expense 

technology and content 

 

 technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

the yearoveryear increase in technology and content expense of 104 million in 2012 and 72 million in 2011 was primarily due to higher personnel costs for additional headcount to support key technology project for our corporate technology function brand expedia and supply organization as well as increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation 

in 2012 the 35 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel expenses including bonus accruals and additional headcount and higher legal fees partially offset by lower consulting fees 

in 2011 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel expenses resulting from an increase in headcount an increase in stockbased compensation expense due to the modification of awards as a result of the spinoff as well as an increase in consulting fees during 2011 our general and administrative expenses included expenses such as bonuses and consulting fees related to both the turnaround of brand expedia and realignment of our supply organization that accelerated the increase in expense 

  

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 in 2012 amortization increased compared to 2011 due to amortization related to the via travel acquisition in addition amortization included an approximate 2 million reduction related to a change in the estimated value of contingent purchase consideration for one of our prior acquisitions in 2011 the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions see note 3 — acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 

 

 legal reserves occupancy tax and other consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy and other tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2012 we recognized 110 million related to monies expected to be paid in advance of litigation related to hawaii’s general excise tax for additional information see note 15 – commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating income 

 

 in 2012 operating income decreased primarily due to increased costs and expenses in excess of revenue as described above including the hawaii tax assessments in the current period partially offset by the growth in revenue 

in 2011 operating income decreased primarily due to increased costs and expenses including a growth in selling and marketing expense technology and content expense and general and administrative expense in excess of revenue growth 

interest income and expense 

 

   

interest income increased in 2012 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalent and investment balances and to a lesser extent higher rates of return on those balances interest income increased in 2011 primarily due to higher average rates of return as well as higher average cash cash equivalents and investment balances 

interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily resulting from additional interest on the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2010 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2012 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states primarily switzerland where our effective rate is lower as well as the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign deferred tax assets the change in the effective rate for 2012 compared to 2011 primarily related to an increase in earnings as a percentage of total earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states as well the release of the valuation allowance 

in 2011 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate and the 2010 effective tax rate primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states 

in 2010 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states and a reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions resulting from the conclusion of 2005 to 2007 irs audits which reversal was partially offset by state income taxes and accruals on continuing uncertain tax positions 

discontinued operations net of taxes 

during 2012 we incurred a loss from early extinguishment of our 85 senior notes due 2016 the “85 notes” resulting directly from the spinoff of tripadvisor the pretax loss was approximately 38 million or 24 million net of tax which included an early redemption premium of 33 million and the writeoff of 5 million of unamortized debt issuance and discount costs this loss was recorded within discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2012 as that was the period in which the 85 notes were legally extinguished 

discontinued operations also include the results of operations of tripadvisor for all periods through spinoff on december 20 2011 in addition discontinued operations include nonrecurring expenses of 14 

  

million incurred to affect the spinoff of tripadvisor during 2011 the reclassification of expense related to the obligation to fund a charitable foundation that was assumed by tripadvisor in conjunction with the spinoff and interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount related to the redemption of the 85 notes in connection with the spinoff for additional information see note 4 — discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 19 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 including 309 million and 302 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances of majorityowned subsidiaries as well as 57 million and 131 million held in foreign subsidiaries related to earnings indefinitely invested outside the united states and our 1 billion revolving credit facility cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states totaled 651 million as of december 31 2012 to date we have permanently reinvested the majority of these foreign earnings outside of the united states and we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to us income taxes 

as of december 31 2012 we maintained a 1 billion revolving credit facility of which 975 million was available this represents the total 1 billion facility less 25 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” the revolving credit facility provides capacity in excess of the outstanding 7456 senior notes in the event of a partial or full redemption at the option of the holders in august 2013 in november 2012 we amended the revolving credit facility to among other things increase the aggregate commitments under the facility from 750 million to 1 billion increase each of the swing line and loc sublimits under the facility to 120 million extend the maturity date of the facility to november 2017 reduce the commitment fee on undrawn amounts thereunder and increase the maximum permissible leverage ratio the revolving credit facility bears interest based on the company’s credit ratings with drawn amounts bearing interest at libor plus 150 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 20 basis points as of december 31 2012 

the indenture governing our 400 million aggregate principal amount of 85 notes contained certain covenants that could have restricted implementation of the spinoff on december 20 2011 prior to consummation of the spinoff we gave “notice of redemption” to the bondholders the effect of which was the bonds became due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price the redemption price was equal to 100 of the principal amount plus a makewhole premium as of and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the redemption date was defined as 30 days after the notice of redemption was given in order to complete the notice of redemption we were required to irrevocably deposit with the trustee funds sufficient to pay the redemption price plus accrued interest on the 85 notes approximately 451 million the 85 notes were fully redeemed on january 19 2012 the redemption date for approximately 450 million in connection with the redemption we incurred a pretax loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately 38 million or 25 million net of tax which included an early redemption premium of 33 million and the writeoff of 5 million of unamortized debt issuance and discount costs this loss was recorded within discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2012 as that is the period in which the bonds were legally extinguished the debt extinguishment was completed in part using the approximately 400 million of cash distributed to us from tripadvisor in connection with the spinoff 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies in april 2011 in response to our announcement of the tripadvisor spinoff moody’s affirmed its ba1 rating and changed its outlook to from “positive” to “stable” while sp and fitch placed the company’s ratings on credit watch with negative implications and rating watch negative respectively in october 2011 fitch affirmed its rating at bbb and removed the rating from rating watch negative with an outlook of “stable” in december 2011 sp affirmed the company’s bbb rating and removed the ratings from credit watch with an outlook of “stable” in october 

  

2012 fitch affirmed its rating at bbb with an outlook of “stable” in december 2012 both sp and moody’s indicated the company’s planned investment in trivago would not impact its credit ratings changes in our operating results cash flows financial position capital structure financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase dividends investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow andor limited to access to capital markets which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we pay after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows however we continue to evaluate the use of merchant model versus the agency model in each of our markets if the merchant hotel model declines relative to other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel or media or if there are changes to the merchant model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payment to suppliers our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed 

for example we recently started introducing new technology to our hotel supply partners which will enable closer integration of the agency hotel model with our core merchant offering in the united states and europe depending on relative traveler and supplier and traveler adoption rates and customer payment preferences among other things the introduction of etp could negatively impact near term working capital cash balances cash flow over time liquidity and the margin we earn per booking 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns as well as changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses including etp may counteract or intensify these anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2012 we had a deficit in our working capital of 368 million compared to a deficit of 279 million as of december 31 2011 the change in deficit is primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by cash generated by operations during 2012 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt our capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to be above 2012 spending levels 

  

our cash flows are as follows

in connection with various occupancy and other tax audits and assessments certain jurisdictions may assert that tax payers are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances which is referred to as “pay to play” these jurisdictions may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we will continue to defend our position vigorously during the year ended december 31 2012 we accrued 110 million related to general excise tax assessments in hawaii if and when the total amounts accrued are paid it will be to the detriment of operating cash flows 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that the cost of availability of future borrowings including refinancing if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes and 595 notes were approximately 598 million and 832 million as of december 31 2012 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 14 million and our 595 notes by approximately 25 million 

we maintain a 1 billion revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we invest in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2012 we had 245 million of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately 2 million as of december 31 2012 such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 or 2010 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had a net forward liability of 3 million included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a net forward asset of 1 million included in prepaid and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other 

  

economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

in december 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 616 equity position in trivago for total consideration of €477 million the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2013 pending approval from relevant competition authorities if the euro was to increase or decrease 10 from the december 31 2012 exchange rate the fluctuation would result in an increase or decrease to the purchase price of approximately 60 million 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 1 million based on our foreign currency forward positions excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2012 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of 16 million 7 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 8 million 5 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and 16 million 8 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

immediately prior to the spinoff we effected a onefortwo reverse stock split of outstanding our capital stock with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares the spinoff was then effected by means of a reclassification of our capital stock such that for every two shares of expedia common stock and class b common stock owned prior to the spinoff and the reverse stock split one share of new expedia common stock or class b common stock and one share of tripadvisor common stock or class b common stock was issued at the effective time of the spinoff in addition immediately following the spinoff our outstanding warrants to purchase common stock converted into adjusted warrants to purchase shares of expedia common stock and new warrants to purchase shares of tripadvisor common stock with terms materially consistent with those contained in the original warrants in connection with a preferred stock merger that occurred prior to completion of the spinoff all outstanding shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock were converted into the right to receive cash

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale affords the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an increasingly larger supply portfolio and creates opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technology very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration today the vast majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however recent technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we own a leading travel application company called mobiata ® which is responsible for several top travel applications such as flighttrack tm  flighttrack pro tm and flightboard tm  and is now creating new mobile applications for our expedia brand most recently launching the mobile expedia hotels application for both the iphone and the ipad we believe mobile bookings present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are typically completed within one day of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods we are also working with suppliers on specific mobile offerings which can represent a unique value proposition and offer customers room nights for as much as a 50 discount from retail rates 

other recent developments in new channels include the proliferation of the ‘daily deals’ space for which we have multiple efforts for example our expedia brand has an exclusive partnership with groupon groupon getaways tm with expedia where we work with suppliers to offer consumers deeply discounted travel opportunities on a limited basis we believe this may also represent incremental travel bookings as it typically represents an impulse purchase compared to historical travel purchasing activity which tends to be a highly considered and deliberate transaction our hotwire brand also operates the travelticker brand which sources and markets deep discount travel virtually all of our leisure brands have efforts related to the daily deals or deep discount space 

  

many of our brands are also actively participating in facebook twitter and other ‘social’ channels and we anticipate the importance of these channels to consumers and to our industry to increase over time it is our intention to grow our ‘social’ efforts alongside this trend 

merchant and agency business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers which often enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model the majority of our merchant revenue primarily relates to hotel bookings 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models in addition we also offer thirdparty preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers 

we also distribute airline tickets hotel rooms cruises and car rentals on an agency model basis with airline ticket transactions currently making up 56 of our agency business for the year ended december 31 2011 with our acquisition of venere in 2008 followed by the 2009 launch of our expedia easy manage agency product targeted for small hotels and hotels in secondary or tertiary cities we expanded the scale of our agency hotel business significantly we expect our agency hotel business to become a bigger part of our hotel mix and overall agency model business mix over time 

relationships with travel partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of hotel companies large and small commercial airlines car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel supply partners through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to generate consumer demand and increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their overall marketing transaction and customer service costs our strategic account managers and local hotel market managers work directly with travel suppliers to optimize the exposure of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in needbased seasonal and eventdriven promotions and experimentation within the new channels we are building 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers’ ‘content’ — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or ‘segments’ the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products our relationships with gdss primarily relate to our air business we use sabre and to a lesser extent amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

  

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and ultimately bookings through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions flowing through our brand and shared global platforms in a costeffective manner 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization as well as metasearch social media sites such as facebook and twitter offline advertising direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships in addition we offer several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers including welcome rewards ® on hotelscom global websites and beginning in 2011 expedia rewards on expediacom the cost of these two loyalty programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in our financial statements 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites affiliate partners can also make travel products and services available on their own websites through an expedia or hotelscom cobranded offering or a private label website our ean business provides our affiliates with technology and access to a wide on range of products and services we manage agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites 

operations and technology 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador and egypt we invested significantly in our call center technologies with the goal of improving customer experience and increasing the efficiency of our call center agents and have plans to continue reaping the benefits of these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of our competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad to achieve global scale we also believe that expedia is one of only a few companies that is focused on building a truly global travel marketplace 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services search engines such as google and bing and travel metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on the multiple channels we use to generate demand quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice as well as offline brand efforts the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

our intellectual property rights including our patents trademarks trade dress proprietary technology and trade secrets are an important component of our business for example we rely heavily upon our intellectual property rights in our content brands software code proprietary technology ratings indexes informational databases images graphics and other components that make up our services we have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties 

  

we protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as international national state and common law rights in addition we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining appropriate registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register copyrights and domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks copyrights and domain names with an enforcement program and use of intellectual property licenses trademark and intellectual property protection may not be available or may not be sought sufficient or effective in every jurisdiction where we operate contractual disputes or limitations may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement or infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including in some countries laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure

 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including online travel agencies travel suppliers large online portal and search companies traditional travel agencies metasearch companies travel content sites including traveler review sites operators of travel industry reservation databases and private shopping websites some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotels search platform with links directly to their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours in recent years social media websites and mobile platforms have emerged and are growing significantly we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively on these or other new sites or platforms that may emerge 

we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies such as priceline travelocity and orbitz which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing and supply breadth in particular we have faced and are facing intense competition from priceline subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

we also face increasing competition from search engines like google bing and yahoo search to the extent that google bing or other leading search or metasearch engines that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities or increasingly refer those leads to suppliers directly or to other favored partners there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example during 2011 google completed its acquisition of flight search technology company ita software and launched a new beta product called google flights in which ota results are not included and separately made changes to its hotel search results including both expanding and promoting the use of google places to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

in addition our websites compete for advertising revenue with these search engines as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies several of these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and businessrelated discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for our services thereby causing a reduction in revenue 

beginning in 2008 domestic and global economic conditions deteriorated rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers which slowed spending on the services we provide and had a negative impact on our revenue growth further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

  

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel occupancy and average daily rates decreases in airline capacity or periodically rising airline ticket prices all of which we have recently experienced events specific to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our business also include fare increases continued carrier consolidation reduced access to discount airfares seat capacity constraints travelrelated strikes or labor unrest bankruptcies or liquidations and increases in fuel prices additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus our business has in the past and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of natural disasters or events such as severe weather conditions volcanic eruptions hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as the h1n1 and avian flu outbreaks such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and constrained liquidity if we as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites over the last several years air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced and in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries in addition our hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers average daily rates or “adrs” meaning that our revenue for each room will generally be proportionately higher or lower depending on the level of the adr for example the significant decline in adrs which began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue in addition adrs on our websites generally declined faster than in the overall travel industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels to the extent adrs decline in the future our hotel booking revenue may be negatively impacted 

also each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that travel suppliers or gds partners will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to implement multiple costly direct connections charge travel agencies for or otherwise restrict access to content credit card fees or other services or further reduce their adrs any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance for example a number of airlines now charge separately for checked baggage food beverages and other services gdss currently have limited technology to incorporate these elements into our product selection impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines own sites or other channels that show this content detail in late 2010 american airlines began to pursue a new distribution strategy requiring online travel agents to agree to connect directly to american airlines’ systems rather than through gdss and our contract with american airlines expired without renewal resulting in american airlines’ fares being temporarily removed from our leisure travel sites american airlines tickets were placed back on the sites in april 2011 and expedia and american airlines have entered into a new agreement if other airlines pursue a similar distribution strategy it could reduce our access to air inventory reduce our compensation result in additional operating expenses related to the development implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology systems increase the frequency or duration of system problems and delay other projects 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we invest considerable financial and human resources in our brands in order to retain and expand our customer base we expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing our brands will increase due to a variety of factors including increased spending from our competitors the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among our multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers our efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands may not be successful and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as efficient as they have been historically moreover successful branding efforts with respect to some brands within the expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future negatively impact growth rates of other brands within our portfolio if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for reservations communications procurement and administration as our operations grow in both size and scope we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features 

  

and functionality while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings the emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology new developments in other areas such as cloud computing could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs 

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort which we expect to continue for several more years to migrate key portions of our site functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to improve conversion introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits these migrations have been in the past and may continue to be in the future more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to develop new site innovations in addition during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future overall these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other trafficgenerating arrangements 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines including google frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties including tripadvisor and search engines pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can experience rapid change both technically and competitively moreover a search engine could for competitive or other purposes alter its search algorithms or results causing a website to place lower in search query results if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization search engine marketing or other trafficgenerating arrangements in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected potentially to a material extent 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence to achieve widespread acceptance as we enter countries and markets that are new to us we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets which can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth 

we are subject to particular risks and uncertainties relating to our operations in china which are primarily through elong an online transactional travel business the success of this business and of any future investments we make in china is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application development and interpretation of china’s laws and regulations significant uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws and regulations including permits and license requirements and such uncertainties could limit the available legal protections relating to our investments moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet and online commerce media foreign investment taxation labor and currency exchange and regulation including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict foreign investment in areas including airticketing travel agency internet content provision mobile communication and related businesses although we have established effective control through a series of agreements between the companies in which our chinese investments are held and their affiliated chinese entities future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure these entities or to engage in strategic transactions capitalization of our chinese entities is also subject to extensive government oversight and regulation and there can be no assurance that we can provide adequate financing for these entities finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china 

other risks we face as a result of our international operations include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers product management personnel development personnel and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

we may experience constraints in our liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable either of which could harm our financial position 

we are accumulating a greater portion of our cash flows in foreign jurisdictions than previously and any repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings would likely result in additional us income tax expense in addition the spinoff of tripadvisor has reduced our overall ability to generate annual cash flow in the future moreover we have experienced and may experience in the future declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow and will likely provide a more significant portion of our operating cash flow following the spinoff of tripadvisor the extent of such impact is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers we also continue to evaluate the use of the agency model versus the merchant model in each of our markets and any change in our relative use of the agency model could have a materially adverse impact on our working capital and liquidity position 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce internet advertising consumer protection and privacy unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services limit marketing methods and capabilities increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities 

for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet online editorial and usergenerated content user privacy behavioral targeting and online advertising taxation liability for thirdparty activities and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide primary ticketing and ticket resale services would require us to change certain aspects of our business operations and client relationships to ensure compliance which could decrease demand for services reduce revenues increase costs andor subject the company to additional liabilities 

adverse application of existing tax or unclaimed property laws rules or regulations or implementation of new unfavorable laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded payroll and other tax or unclaimed property laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable authorities many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax or other laws rules and regulations were amended if new unfavorable laws rules or 

  

regulations were adopted as has recently occurred in certain jurisdictions or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes or unclaimed property the results could increase our tax payments or other obligations prospectively or retrospectively andor subject us to interest andor penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance 

a number of authorities have brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy taxes in addition we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments which may be substantial prior to contesting the validity of such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes we continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations 

our failure to comply with existing laws rules and regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

since our businesses sell airline tickets and provide related services to consumers through a number of different online and offline channels these businesses are subject to a wide variety of statutes rules regulations policies and procedures in various jurisdictions in the united states and abroad which are subject to change at any time our businesses are also subject to laws rules and regulations applicable to providers of primary ticketing and ticket resale services which in some cases regulate the amount of transaction and other fees that they may be charged in connection with primary ticketing sales andor the ticket prices that may be charged in the case of ticket resale services and new legislation of this nature is introduced from time to time in various and is pending in certain jurisdictions in which our businesses sell tickets and provide services the failure of our businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the application of various domestic and international sales use valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by applicable taxing authorities while we believe that we are compliant with current tax provisions taxing authorities may take a contrary position and such positions may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving property personal injury contract alleged infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights and other claims including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and expensive if these legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many different countries significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

in addition we earn an increasing portion of our income and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and incremental cash tax payments in addition there have been proposals to amend us tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which us companies are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our us tax expense and our cash flows 

  

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our internal systems or systems of third parties that we rely upon including multiple colocation providers for data centers and network access or deterioration in the performance of such systems would impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial positions 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition or for certain companies at their discretion an imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

we may also be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites for transactions where we are merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our customers additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty interactive corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty interactive corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of our board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 62 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2011 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty interactive corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac or tripadvisor on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac also upon the effectiveness of our spinoff of tripadvisor mr diller assumed the role of chairman of the board and senior executive of tripadvisor and messrs kaufman and khosrowshahi each became a director of tripadvisor the fact that messrs diller and 

  

kaufman and mr khosrowshahi with respect to tripadvisor hold positions with and securities of these companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia or both tripadvisor and expedia they may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac or of tripadvisor will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac or tripadvisor instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac or tripadvisor this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac or tripadvisor instead of expedia 

we rely on thirdparties for many systems and services 

we rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services including increasingly travel care and information technology services if these thirdparties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business in addition if such thirdparty service providers were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations any of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk that various counterparties including financial entities will fail to perform this creates risk in a number of areas including with respect to our insurance coverages investments bank deposits letters of credit and foreign exchange risk management as it relates to deposits as of december 31 2011 we held time deposits of approximately 364 million at financial institutions including barclays bnp paribas national australia bank and royal bank of scotland and majorityowned subsidiaries held time deposits of approximately 228 million as it relates to foreign exchange as of december 31 2011 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 219 million the fair value of which was approximately 1 million the counterparties to these contracts were banc of america bank of tokyomitsubishi barclays bnp paribas goldman sachs jpmorgan chase royal bank of canada royal bank of scotland and us bank we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts the counterparties are obligated or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts to return our funds or pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts in addition due to instability in the economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2011 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 12 billion risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

  

our discretion in the operation of our business is limited by certain factors including various covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness these covenants also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses 

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

our ability to engage in significant stock transactions could be limited or restricted after our spinoff of tripadvisor inc in december 2011 in order to preserve the tax free nature of the spinoff to expedia current us federal income tax law limits our ability during the twoyear period following the spinoff to enter into certain transactions that might be advantageous to us and our stockholders particularly issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs repurchasing equity securities and under certain limited circumstances acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities or agreeing to be acquired 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and chinese renminbi 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business have made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

we process store and use personal information and other data which subjects us to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations and potential liability related to security breaches 

we may acquire personal or confidential information from users of our websites and mobile applications there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use processing disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data the scope of which are changing subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules we strive to comply with all applicable laws policies legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection it is possible however that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with the privacy policies privacyrelated obligations to users or other third parties or privacy related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation or public statements against the company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers and members to lose trust in the company which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future practices regarding the collection use storage transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny the us congress and federal agencies including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices us courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes including computer trespass and wiretapping laws to the collection and exchange of information online in addition the european union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies including expedia with users in europe and increased costs of compliance 

potential security breaches to our systems whether resulting from internal or external sources could significantly harm our business there can be no guarantee that our existing security measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks a party whether internal or external that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate user information or proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations in the past we have experienced “denialofservice” type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites unavailable for short periods of time as well as unauthorized access of our systems and data we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches and reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures security breaches could result in negative publicity damage to reputation exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions security breaches could also cause travelers and potential users to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions whether for their own systems or systems of vendors could expose us to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance 

acquisitions and investments could result in operating and financial difficulties 

we have acquired a number of businesses in the past and our future growth may depend in part on future acquisitions any of which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 moreover we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies including as they relate to creation ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

  

we cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites rely on content brands and technology much of which is proprietary we protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secret laws patents and confidentiality agreements in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and the use and distribution of our proprietary information even with these precautions it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which our services are made available and policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property any misappropriation or violation of our rights could have a material adverse effect on our business furthermore we may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies content and brands incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies content and brands we may be required to license additional technology content or brands we cannot be sure that such technology content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

summary of the spinoff of tripadvisor inc 

on december 6 2011 our stockholders and board of directors approved a spinoff transaction that separated expedia inc into two separately traded public companies 

 

  

 immediately prior to the spinoff expedia affected a onefortwo reverse stock split the spinoff was completed following the close of trading on the nasdaq stock market on december 20 2011 

in connection with the spinoff we entered into various agreements with tripadvisor a related party due to common ownership including among others a separation agreement a tax sharing agreement an employee matters agreement and a transition services agreement in addition we will continue to work together with tripadvisor pursuant to various commercial agreements between subsidiaries of expedia on the one hand and subsidiaries of tripadvisor on the other hand the various commercial agreements including clickbased advertising agreements content sharing agreements and displaybased and other advertising agreements have terms of up to one year our leisure segment recognized approximately 207 million of sales and marketing expense from tripadvisor in 2011 through the spinoff date and 171 million and 140 million of sales and marketing expense for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we recorded 4 million to sales and marketing expense related to these various agreements from december 21 2011 to december 31 2011 

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change generally 2011 represented a year of gradual improvement for the travel industry however natural disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami in japan political and social unrest in the middle east and north africa the rising price of oil and ongoing sovereign debt and economic issues in several european countries all contribute to a somewhat uncertain forward environment for the travel industry 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm approximately 54 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occur online compared with approximately 39 of european travel online penetration in the asia pacific region is estimated to be over 20 lagging behind that of europe these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services and supplier growth outpaced online agency growth for several years competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies have in some cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies new models such as daily deals and private sale sites have also begun proliferating we have a number of “daily deals” offered on our retail websites as well as deal specific offerings such as hotwire’s travelticker and a partnership with groupon called groupon getaways with expedia in addition we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google and microsoft 

  

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in europe expedia has both a merchant and an agency hotel offer for our hotel supply partners and we expect our use of these models to continue to evolve 

intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins we manage our selling and marketing spending on a brand basis at the local or regional level making decisions in each market that we think are appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity the expected returns and the competitive environment in certain cases we are pursuing and expect to continue to pursue longterm growth opportunities for which our marketing efficiency is lower than that for our consolidated business but for which we still believe the opportunity to be attractive in 2011 our selling and marketing expense has been growing at rates faster than our revenue growth and we expect that to continue for at least the next several quarters however we believe that over the long term we can manage our sales and marketing expense to be more in line with revenue growth 

hotel 

we generate the majority of our revenue through the marketing and distribution of hotel rooms standalone and package bookings our relationships and negotiated economics with our hotel supply partners have remained broadly stable in the past few years we have however implemented new customer loyalty programs and have eliminated or reduced some fees in that timeframe and as such the margin of revenue we earn per booking has declined over the course of the last two years occupancies and adrs in the lodging industry have generally improved in a gradually improving overall travel environment from a supply perspective there is very little new net hotel supply being added in the us lodging market with large chains focusing their development opportunities in international markets this may help hoteliers with their objective of continuing to grow their adrs in international markets hotel supply is being added at a much faster rate as hotel owners and operators try to take advantage of opportunities in faster growing regions such as china and india among others we have had success adding supply to our marketplace with over 145000 hotels as of the end of 2011 growth of 12 in addition our room night growth has been healthy with room nights growing 14 in 2010 and 18 in 2011 adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites grew 1 in 2010 and 5 in 2011 

air 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil in recent years there has been increased air carrier consolidation generally resulting in lower overall capacity and higher fares in addition air carriers have made significant efforts to keep seat capacity relatively low in order to ensure that demand for seats remained high and flights as full as possible reduced seating capacities are generally negative for expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers ticket prices on expedia sites grew 11 and 10 in 2011 and 2010 we are encountering pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew and as air carriers and gds intermediaries renegotiate their longterm agreements 

in part as a result of sharply rising average ticket prices our ticket volumes decreased by 8 in 2011 after having grown by 11 in 2010 

from a product perspective over 70 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we believe that the hotel product is the most profitable of the products we distribute and represents our best overall growth opportunity 

growth strategy 

product innovation  each of our leading brands was a pioneer in online travel and has been responsible for driving key innovations in the space over the past two decades they each operate a dedicated technology team which drives innovations that make researching and shopping for travel increasingly easier and helps customers find and book the best possible travel options in the past several years we made key investments in technology including significant development of our technological platforms that makes it possible for us to deliver innovations at a faster pace for example we launched our new hotelscom global platform in the first quarter of 2010 enabling us to significantly increase the innovation cycle for that brand since then we have been successful in improving conversion and driving much faster growth rates for the hotelscom brand we are in the midst of a similar transformation for our expedia brand having rolled out its new hotel platform in the second half of 2011 with expectations that the new air and package platforms will be launched in 2012 

global expansion our expedia hotelscom egencia ean and hotwire brands operate both domestically and through international points of sale including in europe asia pacific canada and latin america we own a majority share of elong which is the second largest online travel company in china we also own venere a european brand which focuses on marketing hotel rooms in europe egencia our corporate travel business operates in 46 countries around the world and continues to expand aggressively we also partner in a 5050 joint venture with airasia – a low cost carrier serving the asia  pacific region – to jointly grow an online travel 

  

agency business although the results for the joint venture are not consolidated in our financial statements we consider this business to be a key part of our asia pacific strategy in 2011 approximately 39 of our worldwide gross bookings and 42 of worldwide revenue were international up from 22 for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005 we have a stated goal of driving more than half of our gross bookings and revenue through international points of sale 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging these investments when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers we believe that our size and scale affords the company the ability to negotiate competitive rates with our supply partners provide breadth of choice and travel deals to our traveling customers through an increasingly larger supply portfolio and creates opportunities for new value added offers for our customers such as our loyalty programs the size of expedia’s worldwide traveler base makes our sites an increasingly appealing channel for travel suppliers to reach customers in addition the sheer size of our user base and search query volume allows us to test new technology very quickly in order to determine which innovations are most likely to improve the travel research and booking process and then roll those features out to our worldwide audience in order to drive improvements to conversion 

new channel penetration today the vast majority of online travel bookings are generated through typical desktop and laptop computers however recent technological innovations and developments are creating new opportunities including travel bookings made through mobile devices in the past few years each of our brands made significant progress creating new mobile websites and mobile applications that are receiving strong reviews and solid download trends we own a leading travel application company called mobiata which is responsible for several top travel applications such as flighttrack flighttrack pro and flightboard and is now creating new mobile applications for our expedia brand most recently launching the mobile expedia hotels application for both the iphone and the ipad we believe mobile bookings present an opportunity for incremental growth as they are typically completed within one day of the travel or stay which is a much shorter booking window than we have historically experienced via more traditional online booking methods we are also working with suppliers on specific mobile offerings which can represent a unique value proposition and offer customers room nights for as much as a 50 discount from retail rates 

other recent developments in new channels include the proliferation of the ‘daily deals’ space for which we have multiple efforts for example our expedia brand has an exclusive partnership with groupon groupon getaways with expedia where we work with suppliers to offer consumers deeply discounted travel opportunities on a limited basis we believe this may also represent incremental travel bookings as it typically represents an impulse purchase compared to historical travel purchasing activity which tends to be a highly considered and deliberate transaction our hotwire brand also operates the travelticker brand which sources and markets deep discount travel virtually all of our leisure brands have efforts related to the daily deals or deep discount space 

many of our brands are also actively participating in facebook twitter and other ‘social’ channels and we anticipate the importance of these channels to consumers and to our industry to increase over time it is our intention to grow our ‘social’ efforts alongside this trend 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the more stable nature of our fixed costs as a result revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter additionally prior to the spinoff tripadvisor typically comprised a larger relative portion of our revenue and income during the first quarter thus following the spinoff the seasonal impact on our business will be more pronounced particularly in the first quarter as the bookings versus recognition of revenue time lag under the merchant hotel business will represent a larger portion of our operating results without tripadvisor the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of the seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom welcome rewards program and our expediacom expedia rewards tm  welcome rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel flight package and activities made on expediacom as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if so we perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge as of october 1 2011 and 2010 and as of december 20 2011 the date of the spinoff the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying values 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

  

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions such as the states of new york north carolina and minnesota the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

our primary form of employee stockbased compensation is stock option awards we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the blackscholes option valuation model we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised

occupancy taxes 

we are currently involved in 48 lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 

  

 for additional information on these and other legal proceedings see part ii item 1 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 32 million as of december 31 2011 which includes amounts expected to be paid in connection with the developments described above and 24 million as of december 31 2010 in addition as of december 31 2011 we have also accrued 10 million related to court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes 

  

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes during 2009 we expensed 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the city of san francisco during 2010 we expensed 3 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the city of santa monica these funds were returned to us by the city in december 2011 in exchange for a letter of credit we do not believe that the amounts we retain as compensation are subject to the cities’ hotel occupancy tax ordinances if we prevail in the litigation for which a paytoplay payment was made the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts plus interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

in addition certain jurisdictions including the states of new york north carolina and minnesota the city of new york and the district of columbia have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy 

segments 

we have two reportable segments leisure and egencia we determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance 

our leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia affiliate network hotwirecom venere elong and classic vacations 

our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry our organic market share gains and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily driven by 18 growth in hotel room nights and 5 in hotel adrs the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to a 14 growth in transactions a 10 increase in average airfares and a 1 increase in hotel adrs revenue margin for 2011 was essentially flat when compared to 2010 the decrease in revenue margin in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher average air ticket prices 

  

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 in 2011 and 2010 the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in worldwide hotel revenue within our leisure segment 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an 18 increase in room nights stayed revenue per room night was flat year over year competitive pricing actions on hotels and packages as well as accruals for loyalty programs at expedia and hotelscom offset most of the 5 increase in adrs worldwide hotel revenue increased 11 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 14 increase in room nights stayed partially offset by a 3 decline in revenue per room night 

worldwide air revenue decreased 4 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to an 8 decrease in air tickets sold partially offset by a 4 increase in revenue per air ticket the decrease in air tickets sold was partially due to an 11 increase in average air ticket prices revenue per ticket increased in 2011 due to certain regional and interline consumer booking fees and performancebased incentives partially offset by lower net supplier economics worldwide air revenue increased 12 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an 11 increase in air tickets sold and a 1 increase in revenue per air ticket 

worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes car rental advertising and media destination services and fees related to our corporate travel business increased by 8 in 2011 compared to 2010 and 7 in 2010 compared to 2009 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

 the increase in merchant revenue in 2011 and 2010 was due to an increase in hotel revenue primarily driven by an increase in room nights stayed 

agency revenue increased for 2011 compared to 2010 due to growth in our agency hotel business and to a lesser extent higher fees related to our corporate travel business partially offset by lower air revenue agency revenue increased for 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in air revenue as well as increases in hotel fees related to our corporate travel business cruise and destination service revenue 

cost of revenue 

 

   

cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors 2 credit card processing including merchant fees charge backs and fraud and 3 other costs primarily including data center costs to support our websites certain promotions destination supply and stockbased compensation 

in 2011 the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were higher call and data center costs as well as higher credit card processing costs related to our merchant transaction growth partially offset by credit card rebates 

in 2010 the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were higher costs related to credit card processing customer service and telesales to support the growth in our transaction volumes 

selling and marketing 

 

 selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our partner services group egencia and our various leisure brands and stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses increased 240 million in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by increases in online offline and affiliate marketing expenses as well as higher personnel expenses across most of our brands and supply organization selling and marketing expenses increased 174 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in online and offline marketing expenses including search engine marketing brand advertising and affiliate marketing expenses and higher personnel costs including those associated with opening a new global headquarters for our lodging supply group as well as higher professional service costs direct costs include online marketing expenses with tripadvisor of 211 million in 2011 171 million in 2010 and 140 million in 2009 prior to the spinoff these amounts were eliminated but are now included in selling and marketing expense 

technology and content 

 

 technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

the yearoveryear increase of 72 million in technology and content expense in 2011 was primarily due to higher personnel costs for additional headcount to support the expedia brand our corporate technology function and supply organization as well as increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets the yearoveryear increase of 26 million in technology and content expense in 2010 was primarily due to increased personnel costs for increased headcount including contractors to support our worldwide brands an increase in consulting and professional fees as well as an increase in depreciation expense 

  

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation 

in 2011 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel expenses resulting from an increase in headcount an increase in stockbased compensation expense due to the modification of awards as a result of the spinoff as well as an increase in consulting fees during 2011 our general and administrative expenses included expenses such as bonuses and consulting fees related to both the turnaround of the expedia brand and realignment of our supply organization that accelerated the increase in expense 

in 2010 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel expenses recruiting and travel expenses partially offset by a reduction in legal and related fees primarily due to the timing of litigation 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 in 2011 and 2010 the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions see note 3 — acquisitions and other investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

legal reserves occupancy tax and other 

 

 legal reserves occupancy tax and other consists of increases in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes expenses recognized related to monies paid in advance of occupancy tax proceedings “paytoplay” as well as certain other legal reserves 

during 2009 we recognized 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the san francisco occupancy tax proceedings and an accrual of 19 million for the estimated cost of the expedia consumer class action lawsuit for additional information see note 16 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring charges 

during 2009 in conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands and the resulting centralization of locations and brand management marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers we recognized 34 million in restructuring charges these charges were primarily related to employee severance and related benefits restructuring charges related to the brand reorganization were completed by the end of 2009 for additional information see note 14 — restructuring charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

operating income 

 

 in 2011 operating income decreased primarily due to increased costs and expenses including a growth in selling and marketing expense technology and content expense and general and administrative expense in excess of revenue growth in 2010 operating income increased primarily due to an increase in revenue which was offset by a corresponding increase to operating expenses as well as restructuring charges recorded in 2009 that did not recur and higher legal reserves occupancy tax and other recorded in 2009 

interest income and expense 

 

 interest income increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a higher rate of return on cash cash equivalent and investment balances as well as higher average cash cash equivalent and investment balances interest income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalent and investment balances interest expense increased in 2011 and 2010 primarily resulting from additional interest on the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2010 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 our longterm indebtedness totaled 1249 billion for both periods at december 31 2009 our longterm indebtedness totaled 500 million 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2011 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate and the 2010 effective tax rate primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states primarily switzerland where our effective rate is lower 

in 2010 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states where our effective rate is lower and a reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions resulting from the conclusion of 2005 to 2007 irs audits which reversal was partially offset by state income taxes and accruals on continuing uncertain tax positions the change in the effective rate for 2010 compared to the 2009 rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states and a reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions resulting from the conclusion of 2005 to 2007 irs audits partially offset by a 2009 deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary that did not recur in 2010 

  

in 2009 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to a fourth quarter deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary partially offset by state income taxes 

discontinued operations net of taxes 

discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations include the results of operations of tripadvisor for all periods through spinoff on december 20 2011 in addition discontinued operations include nonrecurring expenses of 14 million incurred to affect the spinoff of tripadvisor during 2011 the reclassification of expense related to the obligation to fund a charitable foundation that was assumed by tripadvisor in conjunction with the spinoff and interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount related to the redemption of the 85 senior notes in connection with the spinoff for additional information see note 4 — discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 13 billion and 11 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 including 302 million and 152 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances of majorityowned subsidiaries as well as 131 million and 115 million held in foreign subsidiaries related to earnings indefinitely invested outside the united states and our revolving credit facility cumulative earnings related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the united states totaled 390 million as of december 31 2011 should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise we may be subject to us income taxes 

as of december 31 2011 we maintained a 750 million revolving credit facility of which 728 million was available this represents the total 750 million facility less 22 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” in august 2011 we amended the revolving credit facility to among other things extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to august 2016 reduce the interest rate spread on drawn amounts thereunder and reduce the commitment fee on undrawn amounts thereunder the facility bears interest based on the company’s credit ratings with drawn amounts bearing interest at libor plus 150 basis points and the commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 225 basis points as of december 31 2011 

the indenture governing our 400 million aggregate principal amount of 85 senior notes due 2016 the “85 notes” contained certain covenants that could have restricted implementation of the spinoff on december 20 2011 prior to consummation of the spinoff we gave “notice of redemption” to the bondholders the effect of which was the bonds became due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price the redemption price was equal to 100 of the principal amount plus a makewhole premium as of and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the redemption date is defined as 30 days after the notice of redemption is given in order to complete the notice of redemption we were required to irrevocably deposit with the trustee funds sufficient to pay the redemption price plus accrued interest on the 85 notes approximately 451 million the 85 notes were fully redeemed on january 19 2012 for approximately 450 million in connection with the redemption we incurred a pretax loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately 38 million or 25 million net of tax which included an early redemption premium of 33 million and the writeoff of 5 million of unamortized debt issuance and discount costs this loss will be recorded within discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2012 as that is the period in which the bonds were legally extinguished the debt extinguishment was completed in part using the approximately 400 million of cash distributed to us from tripadvisor in connection with the spinoff 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies in april 2011 in response to our announcement of the tripadvisor spinoff moody’s affirmed its ba1 rating and changed its outlook to from “positive” to “stable” while sp and fitch placed the company’s ratings on credit watch with negative implications and rating watch negative respectively in october 2011 fitch affirmed its rating at bbb and removed the rating from rating watch negative with an outlook of “stable” in december 2011 sp affirmed the company’s bbb rating and removed the ratings from credit watch with an outlook of “stable” changes in our operating results cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we pay after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows if the merchant hotel model declines relative to other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel or media or if there are changes to the merchant model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed seasonal 

  

fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns as well as changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses may counteract or intensify these anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2011 we had a deficit in our working capital of 279 million compared to a deficit of 188 million as of december 31 2010 the change in deficit is primarily due to share repurchases dividend payments and purchases of marketable securities classified as longterm investments partially offset by cash generated by operations during 2011 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 in 2011 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by 221 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes as well as a decrease in income tax payments partially offset by an increase in interest payments in 2010 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 31 million primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization as well as a decrease in income tax payments partially offset by decreased benefits from working capital changes 

in 2011 cash used in investing activities from continuing operations represented a positive change of 281 million primarily due to lower net purchases of investments of 388 million partially offset by higher capital expenditures of 71 million in 2010 cash used in investing activities increased by 754 million primarily due to increased net purchases of investments of 651 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 58 million 

cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2011 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares of  294 million including the repurchased shares under the 2010 authorization discussed below as well as 77 million in cash dividend payments a net 22 million outflow related to the 2011 elong transactions and our purchase of additional interests in another subsidiary partially offset by 34 million of proceeds from the exercise of equity awards cash provided by financing activities in 2010 primarily included the net proceeds of 742 million from the 595 senior notes issued in august 2010 and 51 million of proceeds from the exercise of equity awards partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 502 million including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below 79 million in cash dividend payments as well as 78 million paid to acquire additional interests in certain majority owned subsidiaries 

in 2006 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2010 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during 2011 and 2010 we repurchased through open market transactions 106 million and 206 million shares 53 million and 103 million on a reverse split adjusted basis under these authorizations for a total cost of 283 million and 489 million excluding transaction costs representing an average repurchase price of 2660 and 2371 per share 5320 and 4742 on a reverse split adjusted basis as of december 31 2011 88 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the 2010 authorization there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases no additional repurchases have been made under this authorization as of february 9 2012 

  

in 2011 and 2010 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared the following dividends 

 

 the above dividends per share have been adjusted to reflect the onefortwo reverse stock split in addition on february 9 2012 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 009 per share of outstanding common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 12 2012 future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2011 showed a net increase of 2 million the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2010 showed a net decrease of 29 million primarily due to higher foreigndenominated cash balances in the current year and the relative depreciation in foreign currencies during 2010 compared to their appreciation in 2009 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that future borrowings including refinancings if any will be available on terms acceptable to us 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2011 

 

  

     

  other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2011

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 7456 notes and 595 notes were approximately 563 million and 760 million as of december 31 2011 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 7456 notes by approximately 15 million and our 595 notes by approximately 26 million 

in february 2010 we entered into a new 750 million revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

we invest in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2011 we had 269 million of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately 3 million as of december 31 2011 such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 or 2009 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had a net forward asset of 1 million included in prepaid and other current assets and a net forward liability of 1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal 

  

in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 6 million based on our foreign currency forward positions excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2011 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of 8 million 5 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 16 million 8 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and 29 million 19 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

business strategy 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure unmanaged business or managed business travelers we are committed to providing travelers travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio technology and content innovation global reach and breadth of product offering in addition we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations activities suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand 

we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content about lodging properties such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews in the united states hotelscom generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone 

we have a robust and growing advertising business led primarily by the efforts of the tripadvisor media network which offers travel and other advertisers a host of alternatives for reaching customers in our prime demographic the majority of advertising revenue is generated through clickbased advertising but we also have a growing display advertising business as well as other new products such as hotel business listings vacation rentals and a new private sale site sniqueaway ™  tripadvisor generates customer traffic to its sites by offering a broad and deep selection of hotel reviews and other usergenerated content to help travelers make decisions about where to travel where to stay and what to do while on vacation we also generate advertising revenue on our transaction sites primarily through efforts of expedia ® media solutions 

egencia makes travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

we believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models enabling them to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency merchant and advertising business models we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

technology and content innovation expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expedia’s introduction of opaque hotel inventory through its new unpublished rates product tripadvisor media network’s launch of the new private sale site sniqueaway through its smarter travel media brand and expedia affiliate network’s introduction of ean package rates that gives expedia affiliates the ability to bundle their inventory with expedia hotel package rates in addition in 2010 we increased our focus on mobile offerings and acquired mobiata a mobile application development company to accelerate these efforts 

  

we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience supplier integration and presentation platform improvements search engine marketing and search engine optimization 

global reach our expedia hotelscom and tripadvisor media network brands operate both in north america and internationally we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong and through our tripadvisor brands daodaocom and kuxuncn and we offer hotels to europeanbased travelers through venere in 2010 approximately 36 of our worldwide gross bookings and 38 of worldwide revenue were international 

egencia our corporate travel business operates in north america europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships we believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of egencia 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches may occur under any of our brands or through acquisition of thirdparty brands as in the case of egencia elong kuxun and venere 

breadth of product offering we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer including via our 247 1800 telesales service which is an integral part of the company’s appeal to travelers we offer travelers access to over 130000 hotels and over 300 airlines in over 200 countries around the world 

over 60 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we facilitate travel products and services either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and package businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction however we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our venere expedia and hotelscom brands we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as expediacom and hotelscom which have historically been focused on transaction revenue in 2010 advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 13 of worldwide revenue 

merchant and agency business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the 

  

booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models we also offer thirdparty provided preassembled package offerings primarily through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers 

we also sell airline tickets hotel rooms cruises and car rentals through our agency business with airline ticket transactions currently making up the majority of this business in 2009 we launched expedia easy manage which is our agency hotel offer for small hotels and hotels in secondary or tertiary cities which we expect to become a bigger part of our hotel mix over time although net revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model due to the volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 59 of total gross bookings for the year ended december 31 2010 

relationships with travel suppliers distribution and fulfillment partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial airlines lodging properties car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs our partner services group consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in our seasonal and eventdriven promotions 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or “segments” the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products 

we use sabre and to a lesser extent amadeus and travelport as our gds segment providers in order to ensure the widest possible supply of content for our travelers 

  

fulfillment partners we outsource a portion of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to thirdparty suppliers such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization offline advertising direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships in addition we offer several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers including welcomerewards on hotelscom and beginning in 2011 expedia rewards on expediacom 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites we have agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an expediabranded website a cobranded website or their own private label website we also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services 

operations and technology 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler sales and support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we use a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers our call centers are located throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines el salvador and egypt we have made significant investments in our call center technologies in 2008 through 2010 and have plans to continue these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities 

we have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace for example our best fare search technology essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the united states from gds partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to reassemble multileg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler we have recently made significant investments related to platform improvements for example migrating our hotelscom business onto a single platform new hotel search capabilities international site expansion a variety of customer facing improvements across our brands and new and increased data center capabilities we expect to continue to invest in technology improvements into 2011 and beyond 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad 

  

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services search engines such as google and bing and travel metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs no transaction fees and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

we regard our intellectual property rights including our patents service marks trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success for example we rely heavily upon the software code informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service 

we rely on a combination of laws business practices and contractual obligations with employees suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets despite these precautions it may be possible for a thirdparty to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining our current registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses while we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names effective trademark and domain name protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract in addition our infringement monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or may be registered by us even if available the failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names andor limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our 

  

intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including in some countries laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

financial information about segments and geographic areas

 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including online travel agencies travel suppliers large online portal and search companies traditional travel agencies metasearch companies operators of travel industry reservation databases and private shopping websites some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours in recent years social media websites and mobile platforms have emerged and are growing significantly we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively on these or other new sites or platforms that may emerge 

we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies such as priceline travelocity and orbitz which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing connectivity and supply breadth in particular we have faced and are facing intense competition from priceline subsidiaries bookingcom and agodacom we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition 

our websites including in particular the tripadvisor media network websites also compete for advertising revenue with search engines like google bing and yahoo search that offer payperclick or payperimpression advertising services as well as large internet portal sites that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies these competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases in addition we compete with newspapers magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in higher traffic acquisitions costs reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share reduced customer traffic to our websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on our websites for example google through its launch of google places and its proposed acquisition of ita software if completed as well as bing through its launch of bing travel each took steps during 2010 to appeal more directly to travel customers which could lead to diversion of customer traffic to their own websites or those of a favored partner or undermine our ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results at a reasonable cost or at all in addition if one or more large search engine begins to facilitate travel transactions on its own websites it could also adversely affect our results 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow 

  

more slowly during economic downturns beginning in 2008 domestic and global economic conditions deteriorated rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available financial capital for both business and leisure travelers which slowed spending on the services we provide further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services by both business and leisure travelers which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel occupancy and average daily rates decreases in airline capacity or periodically rising airline ticket prices all of which we have recently experienced events specific to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our business also include fare increases continued carrier consolidation reduced access to airfares travelrelated strikes or labor unrest bankruptcies or liquidations and increases in fuel prices additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus our business has in the past and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of natural disasters or events such as severe weather conditions volcanic eruptions hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as the h1n1 and avian flu outbreaks such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as severe weather conditions actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and constrained liquidity if we as we have done recently in the case of severe weather conditions provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel supplier intermediaries 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites over the last several years air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced or in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries in addition our hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers average daily rates or “adrs” meaning that our revenue for each room will generally be proportionately higher or lower depending on the level of the adr for example the significant decline in adrs which began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue in addition adrs on our websites generally declined faster than in the overall travel industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels to the extent adrs decline in the future our hotel booking revenue may be negatively impacted 

also each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that gds partners or travel suppliers will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to implement direct connections charge travel agencies for or otherwise restrict access to content credit card fees or other services or further reduce their adrs any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance recently some airlines have begun to charge separately for checked baggage food beverages and other services gdss have limited ability to incorporate these elements into our product selection impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines own sites or other channels that show this content detail in late 2010 american airlines began to pursue a new distribution strategy requiring online travel agents to agree to connect directly to american airlines’ systems rather than through gdss and our contract with american airlines expired without renewal resulting in their fares being removed from our leisure travel sites if we cannot reach a new agreement with american airlines or if other airlines pursue a similar distribution strategy it could reduce our access to air inventory reduce our compensation result in additional operating expenses related to the development implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology systems increase the frequency or duration of system problems and delay other projects 

  

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we believe continued investment in our brands including expedia hotelscom hotwire egencia elong venere and the tripadvisor media network is critical to retaining and expanding our traveler supplier and advertiser bases we have spent and expect to continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value due to a variety of factors these include increased spending from our competitors the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers we have spent considerable financial and human resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of our brands and we will continue to invest in and devote resources to advertising and marketing as well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as costeffective as they have been historically if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or search engine disintermediation 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines including google frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and competitively if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected 

in addition to the extent google bing or other leading search or metasearch engines disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities or refer those leads to suppliers directly or to other favored partners there could be a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance for example during 2010 google announced its intention to acquire flight search technology company ita software and separately made changes to its hotel search results including promoting the use of google places to the extent these actions have a negative effect on our search traffic our business and financial performance would be adversely affected 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for reservations communications procurement and administration as our operations grow in both size and scope we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings new developments in areas such as cloud computing could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs 

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear 

  

effort which we expect to continue for several more years to migrate key portions of our site functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities among other anticipated benefits these migrations have been more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected our ability to develop new site innovations continued delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all in addition during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence to achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets including travel supplier relationships and traveler preferences learning the customs and cultures of various countries particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth 

our investments in china create particular risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in china we have two principal businesses operating in china elong an online transactional travel business and tripadvisor china which operates a media site under the brand daodaocom and a metasearch site under the brand kuxuncn the success of these businesses and any future investments we make in china are subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application development and interpretation of china’s laws and regulations significant uncertainties exist regarding the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws and regulations including permits and license requirements and such uncertainties could limit the available legal protections relating to our investments moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet and online commerce media foreign investment taxation labor and currency exchange and regulation including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict foreign investment in areas including airticketing travel agency internet content provision mobile communication and related businesses although we have established effective control through a series of agreements between the companies in which our chinese investments are held and their affiliated chinese entities future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure these entities or to engage in strategic transactions capitalization of our chinese entities is also subject to extensive government oversight and regulation and there can be no assurance we can provide adequate financing for these entities finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china 

other risks we face as a result of our international operations include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we have in the past and may again in the future restructure portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce consumer protection and privacy such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet user privacy taxation and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

adverse application of existing tax laws rules or regulations or implementation of new unfavorable tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax laws rules and regulations were amended if new unfavorable laws rules or regulations were adopted as has recently occurred in certain jurisdictions or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes the results could increase our tax payments prospectively or retrospectively andor subject us to interest andor penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance 

a number of tax authorities have brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit hotel occupancy taxes in addition we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments which may be substantial prior to contesting the validity of such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes we continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations 

  

there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs which may include “paytoplay” payments or surety bond postings associated with complying with and defending our position regarding the various indirect tax ordinances in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in part i item 3 legal proceedings that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and expensive if these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial positions 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition or for certain companies at their discretion an imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

we may also be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites for transactions where we are merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our customers additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many different countries significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

in addition we earn an increasing portion of our income and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to amend us tax laws that would significantly impact the manner in which us companies are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our us tax expense and our cash flows 

we may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control in light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings 

  

by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels or weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital more recent capital markets experience suggests credit spreads can be significantly higher for companies with lower credit ratings impacting returns for bondholders and increasing the cost of potential future debt issuances 

in addition we have experienced and may experience declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow the extent of such impact is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business payment terms with suppliers and relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses we are also accumulating a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions than we had previously and the repatriation of such funds for use in the united states including for corporate purposes such as acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or debt refinancings may result in additional us income tax expense we also continue to evaluate the use of the agency model versus the merchant model in each of our markets and any change in our relative use of the agency model could have a materially adverse impact on our working capital and liquidity position 

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties significant interruptions outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance would impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty media corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty media corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of the board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 61 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2010 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty media corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals 

  

or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from us mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman of the board of directors and senior executive of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that messrs diller and kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both iac and expedia stock could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of messrs diller and kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia both messrs diller and kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between iac and expedia 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between iac and expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

we rely on thirdparties for many systems and services 

we rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services if these thirdparties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business in addition if such thirdparty service providers were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations in addition we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of traveler care and information technology services if we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we ineffectively manage these partners it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 16 billion risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses or maximize stockholder value 

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and chinese renminbi 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in merchant hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel such as from europe to the united states and the united states to europe 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial 

  

statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business has made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk of failure to perform by various financial counterparties including for our insurance coverages investments bank deposits letters of credit and foreign exchange risk management as it relates to foreign exchange we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as of december 31 2010 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately 96 million and the fair value of which was approximately 14 million the counterparties to these contracts were jpmorgan chase barclays royal bank of scotland banc of america bank of tokyomitsubishi royal bank of canada and bnp paribas upon the maturity of these or subsequent contracts the counterparties are potentially obligated to pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these forward contracts in addition due to the weakening economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches 

in the processing of our traveler transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and we rely on information collected online for purposes of advertising to visitors to our websites this information is increasingly subject to legislation regulations and industry policies in numerous jurisdictions around the world these requirements and restrictions are not necessarily consistently applied this government and industry action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation regulations or other requirements are expanded to require changes in our current business practices or if governing jurisdictions or industry groups interpret or implement their requirements in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues for regulators and consumers we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the protections that should apply to travel andor online data 

we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches in addition certain of our acquired companies may not have the same standards related to data collection storage and transfer that expedia has historically maintained failure to improve their standards or a substantial data breach in any of our businesses could significantly harm our business damage our reputation expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability andor cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands 

these and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties 

our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions to the extent that we grow through acquisitions we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy we would also face operational risks such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses disrupting their ongoing businesses increased complexity of our business impairing management resources and their 

  

relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management further the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business may divert management time and other resources some acquisitions may not be successful and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value 

certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

our websites rely on content and technology intellectual property much of which we regard as proprietary we protect our proprietary technology by relying on trademarks copyrights trade secret laws patents and confidentiality agreements in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and distribution of our technology documentation and other proprietary information even with all of these precautions it is possible for someone else to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or content without our authorization or to develop similar technology independently effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the internet and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information this misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future we may need to go to court to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies we may be required to license additional technology we cannot be sure that such technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

all percentages within this section are calculated on actual unrounded numbers 

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and other suppliers of travel products and services has historically been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change in 2009 during the global recession expedia was able to grow volumes robustly by exposing excellent travel deals to our customers however we eliminated or reduced a wide variety of customer fees airfare and hotel room prices were down substantially and advertising rates were soft which led to revenue growth in 2009 of only 1 during 2010 we experienced an improving travel environment with air carriers flying at very high load factors and hoteliers generally seeing stronger occupancies and rising room rates as such our 2010 yearoveryear unit growth moderated compared to 2009 but our unit economics eg revenue per ticket improved and our revenue growth accelerated to 13 

we believe the combination of high unemployment rates pressure on consumer spending european volcanic activity and related travel disruptions foreign currency fluctuations overall uncertainty about the european economy actual and threatened labor strikes and rising airfares caused some ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the travel market during 2010 global economic conditions remain uncertain and as such our nearterm visibility remains limited 

airline sector 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil in recent years there has been increased air carrier consolidation generally resulting in lower overall capacity and higher fares in addition air carriers have made significant efforts to keep seat capacity relatively low in order to ensure that demand for seats remained high and flights as full as possible reduced seating capacities are generally negative for expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers ticket prices on expedia sites declined by 15 yearoveryear in 2009 but grew 10 in 2010 although air capacity discipline appears to generally remain in place there are early signs that carriers are beginning to add some capacity as we move into 2011 

in the spring of 2009 expediacom and other major online travel agencies began offering air tickets to consumers without an associated online booking fee matching the airline supplier sites these actions led to robust ticket growth but severe pressure on our revenue per ticket after we passed the anniversary of these fee cuts our ticket volume growth moderated but our revenue per ticket began to grow leading to an improved revenue performance for our air product we believe that the economics for our air business are largely stable in the near term though we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew and as air carriers and gdss renegotiate their longterm agreements in 2011 for example in late 2010 american airlines began to pursue a new distribution strategy requiring online travel agents to agree to connect directly to american airlines’ systems rather than through gdss and our contract with american airlines expired without renewal resulting in their fares being removed from our leisure travel sites 

hotel sector 

during the recession lodging companies generally saw significantly reduced occupancies and adrs in that environment suppliers increasingly turned to expedia to help fill more rooms while travelers increasingly looked to expedia to find excellent travel deals this combination led to robust room night growth and a substantial reduction in our revenue per room night since our remuneration in our hotel business varies proportionally with the room price in 2010 occupancy rates and adrs began to improve for the lodging suppliers in an improving overall travel environment this led to moderating though still healthy room night growth and an improving adr environment adrs for rooms booked on expedia sites declined by 15 yearoveryear for 2009 but grew 1 in 2010 

  

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2010 approximately 54 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online compared with approximately 37 of european travel online penetration in the asia pacific region is estimated to be around 20 lagging behind that of europe these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future 

in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services and supplier growth outpaced online agency growth for several years as a result according to phocuswright by 2010 travel supplier sites accounted for 59 of total online travel spend in the united states more recently due to booking fee reductions and eliminations online agents appear to have regained some share of overall online travel spend our visibility on whether these share gains continue in 2011 and beyond is limited 

differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies have in some cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies although in most cases they are not providing actual travel booking services some of these competitors have raised significant amounts of capital and have begun to aggressively market their service offerings in addition beginning in 2009 and through 2010 we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies as evidenced by recent innovations and proposed and actual acquisitions by companies such as google and microsoft 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in europe and in 2009 expedia introduced a competitive offering while agency hotel is an important component of our european strategy we expect it will continue to take time for expedia to drive meaningful demand to those hotels 

intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins in 2009 we experienced a reversal of these trends due to several factors including the softer macro environment lower ad rates and a pullback in spend by some of our online competitors impacted by lower fee revenues our marketing spend in 2010 has returned to a more normalized environment as the economy has improved and as we have increased marketing spend associated with our international growth opportunities we believe that over the long term we can manage our sales and marketing expense largely in line with revenue growth as a result of our large and growing travel advertising business we have a partial hedge with regard to the price of advertising as advertising prices rise our leisure transaction brands may spend more on their marketing efforts while the tripadvisor media network benefits from rising prices through revenue growth 

strategy 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure unmanaged business or managed business travelers we are committed to providing travelers travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio technology and content innovation global reach and breadth of product offering in addition we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations activities suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings 

  

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

portfolio of travel brands  we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand 

we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews in the united states hotelscom generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone 

we have a robust and growing advertising business led primarily by the efforts of the tripadvisor media network which offers travel and other advertisers a host of alternatives for reaching customers in our prime demographic the majority of advertising revenue is generated through clickbased advertising but we also have a growing display advertising business as well as other new products such as hotel business listings vacation rentals and a new private sale site sniqueaway tripadvisor generates customer traffic to its sites by offering a broad and deep selection of hotel reviews and other usergenerated content to help travelers make decisions about where to travel where to stay and what to do while on vacation we also generate advertising revenue on our transaction sites primarily through efforts of expedia media solutions 

egencia makes travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

we believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models allowing them to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency merchant and advertising business models we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

technology and content innovation expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expedia’s introduction of opaque hotel inventory through its new unpublished rates product tripadvisor media network’s launch of the new private sale site sniqueaway through its smarter travel media brand and expedia affiliate network’s introduction of ean package rates that gives expedia affiliates the ability to bundle their inventory with expedia hotel package rates in addition in 2010 we increased our focus on mobile offerings and acquired mobiata a mobile application development company to accelerate these efforts 

we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience supplier integration and presentation platform improvements search engine marketing and search engine optimization 

global reach our expedia hotelscom and tripadvisor media network brands operate both in north america and internationally we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong and through our tripadvisor brands daodaocom and kuxuncn and we offer hotels to europeanbased travelers through venere in 2010 approximately 36 of our worldwide gross bookings and 38 of worldwide revenue were international 

egencia our corporate travel business operates in north america europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships we believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of egencia 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 

  

we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches may occur under any of our brands or through acquisition of third party brands as in the case of egencia elong kuxun and venere 

breadth of product offering  we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer including via our 247 1800 telesales service which is an integral part of the company’s appeal to travelers we offer travelers access to over 130000 hotels and over 300 airlines in over 200 countries around the world 

over 60 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we facilitate travel products and services either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction however we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our venere expedia and hotelcom brands we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as expediacom and hotelscom which have historically been focused on transaction revenue in 2010 advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 13 of worldwide revenue 

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer as a result revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the 

  

consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

marketing promotions 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services which include inducement offers inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates we allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used 

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom welcomerewards program welcomerewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill  we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that 

  

reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets  we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge as of october 1 2010 and 2009 the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying values for additional information about our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008 see note 6 — goodwill and intangible assets net in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies  we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax  some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the occupancy tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer in all but a limited number of jurisdictions we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to pay such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors 

  

include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the statutes and regulations that impose hotel occupancy taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce certain jurisdictions such as the states of new york and north carolina and the city of new york have enacted and others may enact legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings recent occupancy tax developments are also discussed below under the caption “occupancy taxes” 

stockbased compensation 

in 2009 and 2010 we awarded stock options as our primary form of employee stockbased compensation we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the blackscholes option valuation model we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy taxes 

we are currently involved in 51 lawsuits brought by or against states cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy taxes we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously with respect to the principal claims in these matters we believe that the ordinances at issue do not apply to the services we provide namely the facilitation of hotel reservations and therefore that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed we believe that the ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own operate or control hotels or similar businesses or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations 

recent developments include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 for additional information on recent developments see part ii item 1 legal proceedings 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy tax litigation consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances in the amount of 24 million as of december 31 2010 and 21 million as of december 31 2009 a variety of factors could affect the ultimate amount we pay if any in connection with any of the occupancy taxrelated matters in addition as of december 31 2010 we have accrued 13 million related to court decisions and final settlements which includes amounts expected to be paid in connection with the south carolina litigation  

certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes during 2010 and 2009 we expensed 3 million and 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in occupancy tax proceedings in the cities of santa monica and san francisco we do not believe that the amounts we retain as compensation are subject to the cities’ hotel occupancy tax ordinances if we prevail in the litigation the cities will be required to repay these amounts plus interest however any significant paytoplay payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity 

in addition certain jurisdictions including the states of new york and north carolina and the city of new york have enacted legislation taxing online travel company services as part of sales taxes for hotel occupancy 

segments 

we have three reportable segments leisure the tripadvisor media network and egencia we determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance 

our leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia affiliate network hotwirecom venere elong and classic vacations 

our tripadvisor media network segment provides advertising services to travel suppliers on its websites which aggregate traveler opinions and unbiased travel articles about cities hotels restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through tripadvisorcom and its localized international versions as well as through its various travel media content properties within the tripadvisor media network 

our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

  

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating expedia gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

  

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to a 14 growth in transactions a 10 increase in average airfares and a 1 increase in hotel adrs the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an 18 growth in transactions substantially offset by lower prices for airline tickets and hotel room nights 

the decrease in revenue margin in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher average air ticket prices partially offset by growth in advertising and media revenue the decrease in revenue margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the reduction in traveler fees the impact of our loyalty programs and a greater mix of lower margin hotels partially offset by lower air ticket prices and a reduction in the mix of lower margin air product 

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 in 2010 the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in worldwide hotel revenue within our leisure segment as well as an increase in advertising and media revenue within tripadvisor media network 

  

worldwide hotel revenue increased 11 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 14 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of packages partially offset by a 3 decline in revenue per room night 

worldwide air revenue increased 12 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an 11 increase in air tickets sold and a 1 increase in revenue per air ticket 

worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services and agency cruise increased by 19 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in our advertising and media revenue 

in 2009 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases within our leisure segment in hotel car and advertising and media revenue and an increase within our tripadvisor media segment in advertising and media revenue these increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 2 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 23 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of packages and room nights booked through venere which we acquired in september 2008 partially offset by a 17 decline in revenue per room night revenue per room night declined largely due to a 15 decrease in adrs including a reduction in traveler fees excluding room nights stayed through venere room nights grew 20 for the year 

worldwide air revenue decreased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 24 decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by a 15 increase in ticket volumes expediacom eliminated consumer booking fees on online air tickets in march 2009 with certain other points of sale following at various dates into the third quarter of 2009 which primarily drove the decline in revenue per ticket this elimination of fees on expediacom and other points of sale combined with lower average ticket prices contributed to the increase in our air ticketing volumes 

worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above increased by 5 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

  

 our merchant revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 increased due to an increase in merchant hotel revenue primarily driven by an increase in room nights stayed our merchant revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 was relatively flat as increases in car revenue were offset by decreases in air revenue 

agency revenue increased for 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in air revenue as well as increases in hotel corporate products cruise and destination service revenue agency revenue decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in air revenue primarily resulting from our expediacom us booking fee removal and decreased agency package revenue partially offset by higher hotel revenue related to venere and higher car revenue 

advertising and media revenue increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 48 increase in advertising revenue at tripadvisor media network advertising and media revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 21 increase in advertising revenue at our leisure transactionbased websites as well as a 6 increase at tripadvisor media network 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors 2 credit card processing including merchant fees charge backs and fraud and 3 other costs primarily including data center costs to support our websites certain promotions destination supply and stockbased compensation 

in 2010 the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were higher costs related to credit card processing customer service and telesales to support the growth in our transaction volumes 

in 2009 the primary drivers of the decrease in cost of revenue expense were a decrease in credit card processing costs as a result of our technology investments lower promotions expense and air fulfillment efficiencies primarily resulting from bringing some of our air ticket fulfillment operations inhouse 

selling and marketing 

 

 selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our partner services group the tripadvisor media network egencia and our various leisure brands and stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses increased 177 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in online and offline marketing expenses including search engine marketing brand advertising and affiliate marketing expenses and higher personnel costs including those associated with opening a new global headquarters for our lodging supply group as well as higher professional service costs 

selling and marketing expenses decreased 78 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower offline brand spending for our global websites lower online spend as well as lower private label and affiliate expenses associated with the lower overall travel demand environment offline and online advertising spend decreased primarily as a result of a lower cost advertising environment our investments in search engine optimization and marketing and costs for other customer value enhancements that stimulate demand but do not impact selling and marketing expense such as fee reductions and loyalty programs these decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct costs for venere 

  

technology and content 

 

 technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

the yearoveryear increase of 42 million in technology and content expense in 2010 was primarily due to increased personnel costs for increased headcount including contractors to support our worldwide transactionbased businesses and our tripadvisor media network businesses an increase in consulting and professional fees as well as an increase in depreciation expense 

the yearoveryear increase of 32 million in technology and content expense in 2009 was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets as well as increased incentive compensation expense 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation 

in 2010 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in our reserves for court decisions and the potential and final settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes as well as higher personnel expenses recruiting and travel expenses partially offset by a reduction in legal and related fees primarily due to the timing of litigation 

in 2009 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal fees settlements and other professional fees of 16 million including costs related to the consumer class action lawsuit and occupancy tax matters as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased incentive compensation expense 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

   

in 2010 the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain intangible assets partially offset by a charge of approximately 4 million related to changes in the estimated value of contingent purchase consideration and amortization related to new business acquisitions in 2009 the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology supplier relationship and distribution agreement intangible assets partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 — acquisitions and other investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy tax assessments and legal reserves 

during 2010 we recognized 3 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the santa monica occupancy tax proceedings and a 3 million expense related to an increase in the estimated coupon redemption rate related to the expedia consumer class action lawsuit   during 2009 we recognized 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the san francisco occupancy tax proceedings and an accrual of 19 million for the estimated settlement cost of the expedia consumer class action lawsuit for additional information see note 15 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

restructuring charges 

during 2009 in conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands and the resulting centralization of locations and brand management marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers we recognized 34 million in restructuring charges these charges were primarily related to employee severance and related benefits restructuring charges related to the brand reorganization were completed by the end of 2009 for additional information see note 13 — restructuring charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets 

in 2008 we recorded impairments of approximately 3 billion of longterm assets which consisted of 28 billion of goodwill 223 million of intangible assets and 11 million related to capitalized software impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our indefinitelived trade names for additional information about our impairments see note 6 — goodwill and intangible assets net in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we recorded no such impairments in 2010 and 2009 

operating income loss 

 

 in 2010 operating income increased primarily due to an increase in revenue which was offset by a corresponding increase to operating expenses as well as restructuring charges recorded in 2009 that did not recur and higher occupancy tax assessments and legal reserves recorded in 2009 

in 2009 the change to operating income was due to the prior year impairment of longterm assets of approximately 3 billion in addition selling and marketing expense and cost of revenue decreased compared to the increase in revenue partially offset by the san francisco occupancy tax assessments restructuring charges and class action settlement legal reserve as well as growth in technology and content and general and administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth 

  

interest income and expense 

 

 interest income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily resulting from additional interest on the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2010 

interest income decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower average interest rates interest expense increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily resulting from interest on the 400 million senior unsecured notes issued in june 2008 partially offset by lower interest expense related to our revolving credit facility 

at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our longterm indebtedness totaled 1645 billion 895 million and 1545 billion 

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 in 2008 in connection with the closing of an acquisition and the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase price we recognized a net loss of 21 million included in foreign exchange rate losses net 

provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2010 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states where our effective rate is lower and a reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions resulting from the conclusion of 2005 to 2007 irs audits which reversal was partially offset by state income taxes and accruals on continuing uncertain tax positions the change in the effective rate for 2010 compared to the 2009 rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states and a reversal of accruals for uncertain tax positions resulting from the conclusion of 2005 to 2007 irs audits partially offset by a 2009 deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary that did not recur in 2010 

in 2009 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to a fourth quarter deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary partially offset by state income taxes the change in the 2009 effective rate compared to the 2008 rate was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in 2008 of which 

  

a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 415 and our 2009 effective rate was lower than this rate primarily due to the deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary and to a lesser extent lower accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

in 2008 our effective tax rate differed from the 35 statutory rate due to the impairment of goodwill of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 415 which was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 12 billion and 688 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 including 153 million and 148 million of cash and shortterm investment balances of majorityowned subsidiaries and our revolving credit facility 

in august 2010 we privately placed 750 million of senior unsecured notes due in august 2020 in december 2010 we completed an offer to exchange these notes for registered notes having substantially the same financial terms and covenants as the original notes the unregistered and registered notes collectively the “595 notes” the 595 notes were issued at 99893 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in february and august of each year beginning february 15 2011 

in february 2010 we entered into a new 750 million threeyear revolving credit facility replacing our prior credit facility in august 2010 we amended the new facility extending the maturity to august 2014 decreasing the interest rate spreads and fees and modifying certain covenants and other terms current pricing is based on the company’s credit ratings with drawn amounts bearing interest at libor plus 250 basis points and undrawn amounts bearing interest at 375 basis points as of december 31 2010 723 million was available under the facility representing the total 750 million facility less 27 million of outstanding standby letters of credit 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies in october 2009 our longterm ratings from moody’s and standard and poor’s were raised to ba1 and bbb respectively standard and poor’s maintains a stable ratings outlook and moody’s changed its outlook to positive in august 2010 changes in our operating results cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations however at any time during which standard and poor’s and moody’s assign an investment credit rating to the company and no default exists under the 85 note indenture certain of the covenants for our 85 notes including the covenants limiting under certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness pay dividends or make restricted payments and dispose of assets will be suspended during that time period 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we pay after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital related to merchant hotel transactions will positively impact operating cash flows if the merchant hotel model declines relative to other business models that generally consume working capital such as agency hotel managed corporate travel or media or if there are changes to the merchant model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers our overall working capital benefits could be reduced eliminated or even reversed 

  

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates changes to the model or booking patterns as well as changes in the relative mix of merchant hotel transactions compared with transactions in our working capital consuming businesses may counteract or intensify these anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2010 we had a deficit in our working capital of 188 million compared to a deficit of 610 million as of december 31 2009 the change in deficit is primarily due to financing and investing activities including proceeds from the issuance of the 750 million senior unsecured notes issued in august 2010 partially offset by share repurchases dividend payments and purchases of marketable securities classified as longterm investments 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code platform migrations and consolidation and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions share repurchases dividend payments or expenditures in support of our business strategy thus reducing our cash balance andor increasing our debt 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 in 2010 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 101 million primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization as well as a decrease in income tax payments partially offset by decreased benefits from working capital changes in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 155 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes and growth in operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in income tax and interest payments as well as occupancy tax assessments 

in 2010 cash used in investing activities increased by 770 million primarily due to increased net purchases of investments of 672 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 63 million in 2009 cash used in investing activities represented a positive change of 812 million in cash flows primarily due to a 493 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions cash provided by the net maturities of investments of 47 million in 2009 compared to 93 million in purchases in 2008 and a decrease in capital expenditures of 68 million 

cash provided by financing activities in 2010 primarily included the net proceeds of 742 million from the 595 senior notes issued in august 2010 and 51 million of proceeds from the exercise of equity awards partially offset by cash paid to acquire shares of 502 million including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below 79 million in cash dividend payments as well as 78 million paid to acquire additional interests in certain majority owned subsidiaries cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily included the repayment of 650 million of borrowings under the credit facility cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included 457 million of net borrowings of debt 

in 2006 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock on october 25 2010 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock during 2010 

  

we repurchased through open market transactions 206 million shares under these authorizations for a total cost of 489 million excluding transaction costs representing an average repurchase price of 2371 per share as of december 31 2010 194 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the october 2010 authorization there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases no additional repurchases have been made under this authorization as of february 10 2011 

in 2010 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared the following dividends 

 

 in addition on february 9 2011 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share of outstanding common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 11 2011 future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2010 showed a net decrease of 29 million primarily due to higher foreigndenominated cash balances in the current year and the relative depreciation in foreign currencies during 2010 compared to their appreciation in 2009 the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2009 showed a net increase of 87 million primarily due to the relative appreciation in foreign currencies during 2009 compared to their depreciation in 2008 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs there can be no assurance however that future borrowings including refinancings if any will be available on terms acceptable to us

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables investments merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in august 2010 we issued 750 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 595 in june 2008 we issued 400 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 85 in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 85 notes our 7456 notes and 595 notes were approximately 438 million 561 million and 743 million as of december 31 2010 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 85 notes by approximately 10   million our 7456 notes by approximately 16   million and our 595 notes by approximately 27 million 

in february 2010 we entered into a new 750 million revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding 

during 2010 we began investing in investment grade corporate debt securities and as of december 31 2010 we had 244 million of available for sale investments based on a sensitivity analysis we have determined 

  

that a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our investments of approximately 2 million as of december 31 2010 such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 or 2008 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally during 2008 we began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had a net forward liability of 1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a net forward asset of less than 1 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 4 million based on our foreign currency forward positions excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2010 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of 18 million 14 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 30 million 20 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue and 47 million as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

business strategy 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure unmanaged business or managed business travelers we are committed to providing travelers travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio technology and content innovation global reach and breadth of product offering in addition we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations activities suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand 

we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content about lodging properties such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews in the united states hotelscom generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone 

through egencia we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in north america europe and the asia pacific region further the tripadvisor media network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and usergenerated content 

we believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models enabling them to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency merchant and advertising business models we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

technology and content innovation expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expedia’s introduction of its “expedia easy manage” program offering smaller properties in secondary and tertiary markets in europe and asia pacific through an agency model hotel program media solutions introduction of rich media display ads called storepoint expandables tripadvisor’s launch of its family vacation critic which offers reviews of kidfriendly and parenttested hotels resorts attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation and flipkey’s launch of selfservice listings for vacation property owners to merchandise their offerings 

we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience supplier integration and presentation platform improvements search engine marketing and search engine optimization 

  

global reach our expedia hotelscom and tripadvisor media network brands operate both in north america and internationally we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong and through our tripadvisor brands daodaocom and kuxuncn and we offer hotels to europeanbased travelers through our whollyowned subsidiary venere which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008 in 2009 approximately 34 of our worldwide gross bookings and 37 of worldwide revenue were international 

egencia our corporate travel business operates in north america europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships we believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of egencia 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches may occur under any of our brands or through acquisition of thirdparty brands as in the case of elong venere kuxun and egencia 

breadth of product offering we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer including via our 247 1800 telesales service which is an integral part of the company’s appeal to travelers 

over 60 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we facilitate travel products and services either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and package businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction however we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our venere brand as well as our expedia and hotelscom brands we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as expediacom and hotelscom which have historically been focused on transaction revenue in 2009 advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11 of worldwide revenue 

merchant and agency business models 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

  

as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models we are also expanding our use of thirdparty provided preassembled package offerings particularly through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers 

our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets hotel cruise and car rental reservations airline ticket transactions currently make up the majority of this business in the third quarter of 2008 we acquired venere an agencybased online hotel business in europe and since then have launched expedia easy manage which is our agency hotel offer for small hotels and hotels in secondary or tertiary cities although net revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 58 of total gross bookings for the year ended december 31 2009 

relationships with travel suppliers distribution and fulfillment partners 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines lodging properties car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs our partner services group consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in our seasonal and eventdriven promotions 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet our travelers can now book reservations with over 64000 merchant hotel properties worldwide of which approximately 56 are now fully directconnected 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or “segments” the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products 

we use sabre and amadeus as our primary gds segment providers prior to 2007 we primarily used worldspan we added the additional gdss in order to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers 

  

fulfillment partners we outsource a portion of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to thirdparty suppliers such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services 

marketing and promotions 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization offline advertising direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships in addition we offer several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers including the thankyou rewards on expediacom welcomerewards on hotelscom and nectar in the united kingdom 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites we have agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an expediabranded website a cobranded website or their own private label website we also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services 

operations and technology 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we provide this support infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers which are located in various locations throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines and el salvador we have made significant investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and 2009 and have plans to continue these investments going forward 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities 

we have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace for example our best fare search technology essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the united states from gds partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to reassemble multileg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler we are looking to expand this technology internationally we are also investing in improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive rates for our travelers 

we continue to invest in our operations and technology infrastructure and we anticipate additional travelerfacing benefits in 2010 

competition 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these 

  

markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services search engines and travel metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs no transaction fees and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers as opposed to a single supplier and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

intellectual property rights 

we regard our intellectual property rights including our patents service marks trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success for example we rely heavily upon the software code informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service 

we rely on a combination of laws business practices and contractual obligations with employees suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets despite these precautions it may be possible for a thirdparty to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining our current registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses while we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names effective trademark and domain name protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract in addition our infringement monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or may be registered by us even if available the failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names andor limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

  

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

regulation 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including in some countries laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

we generate our revenue through a diverse customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers no customer represented 10 or more of our total revenue in the periods presented in this annual report on form 10k 

beginning in the first quarter of 2009 we have three reportable segments leisure the tripadvisor media network and egencia the change from two reportable segments north america and europe was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands the segment and geographic information required herein is contained in note 16 — segment information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

additional information 

company website and public filings we maintain a corporate website at wwwexpediainccom except as explicitly noted the information on our website as well as the websites of our various brands and businesses is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k or in any other filings with or in any information furnished or submitted to the sec 

we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to sections 13a or section 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 

code of ethics we post our code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all employees including all executive officers senior financial officers and directors on our corporate website at wwwexpediainccom our code of business conduct and ethics complies with item 406 of sec regulation sk and the rules of nasdaq we intend to disclose any changes to the code that affect the provisions required by item 406 of regulation sk and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive officers senior financial officers or directors on our corporate website 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 7960 fulltime and parttime employees including approximately 1770 employees of elong we believe we have good relationships with our employees including relationships with employees represented by works councils or other similar organizations 




 part i item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business andor financial performance 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travelrelated services including online travel agencies travel suppliers large online portal and search companies traditional travel agencies metasearch companies and operators of travel industry reservation databases some of our competitors particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours 

in addition we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies such as pricelinecom travelocity and orbitz which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing connectivity and supply breadth in particular we have faced and are facing intense competition in europe from bookingcom a subsidiary of priceline we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to make changes to our business models which could affect our financial performance and liquidity increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base 

global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns including downturns in any of our major markets in late 2008 and 2009 there was a rapid deterioration of domestic and global economic conditions and the outlook for 2010 is uncertain this slowing of the domestic and global economies has increased unemployment and reduced the financial capacity of both corporate and leisure travelers thereby slowed spending on the services we provide particularly in the first half of 2009 we cannot predict the magnitude length or recurrence of the recessionary economic patterns however the continuation or worsening of domestic and global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our business and financial performance 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry including by decreases in hotel occupancy rates hotel average daily rates decreases in airline capacity or 

  

periodically rising airline ticket prices all of which we have recently experienced events or weakness specific to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our business also include fare increases travelrelated strikes or labor unrest bankruptcies or liquidations and fuel price volatility additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus our business has in the past and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as the h1n1 and avian flu outbreaks such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business working capital and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel supplier intermediaries 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites over the last several years air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced or in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries in addition our hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers average daily rates or “adrs” meaning that our revenue for each room will generally be proportionately higher or lower depending on the level of the adr the significant decline in adrs which began in late 2008 and continued into 2009 has accordingly negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue to the extent adrs are pressured even further in 2010 our hotel booking revenue may be further negatively impacted during the recent decline we have experienced a drop in adrs generally faster than the overall industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels we expect this trend to continue until the hotel industry begins to rebound also each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that gds partners or travel suppliers will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to charge travel agencies for content credit card fees or other services or further reduce their adrs any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance more recently airlines have been “unbundling” various services such as food and beverage baggage and other services from base airfares gdss have been slow to incorporate these elements into our product selection impacting our product display and comparability with the airlines own sites or other channels that show this content detail adverse changes in existing relationships increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms if at all could reduce the amount quality and breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that we are able to offer which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

we believe continued investment in our brands including expedia hotelscom hotwire classic vacations egencia elong venere the tripadvisor media network and expedia local expert is critical to retaining and expanding our traveler supplier and advertiser bases we have and expect to continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value due to a variety of factors these include increased spending from our competitors the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers we have spent considerable financial and human resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of our brands and we will continue to invest in and devote resources to advertising and marketing as well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands we may not be able to successfully 

  

maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as costeffective as they have been historically if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or search engine disintermediation 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines including google frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and competitively if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected in addition to the extent google bing and other leading search engines attempt to more directly appeal to travel consumers by maintaining transactions within their own websites or referring those leads to suppliers directly that could have a meaningfully adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for reservations communications procurement and administration as our operations grow in both size and scope we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings new developments in areas such as cloud computing could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower upfront technology costs 

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we have been engaged in a multiyear effort which we expect to continue for several years to migrate portions of our site functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising capabilities among other anticipated benefits these migrations have been more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected our ability to develop new site innovations continued delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all in addition during the migration process the sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future if any of these events occur our business and financial performance could suffer 

we rely on thirdparties for many systems and services 

we rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing systems development technology and other services if these thirdparties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business in addition if such thirdparty service providers were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations in addition we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of traveler care and information 

  

technology services if we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we ineffectively manage these partners it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers developers and other technology professionals also remains intense 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we are continuing the process of restructuring portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance 

our stock price is highly volatile 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence to achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets including travel supplier relationships and traveler preferences learning the customs and cultures of various countries particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth 

we expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce consumer protection and privacy such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet user privacy taxation and the quality of products and services 

  

furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

adverse application of tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax laws rules and regulations were amended if new adverse laws rules or regulations were adopted or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes the results could increase our tax payments prospectively or retrospectively andor subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance 

tax authorities have brought lawsuits and have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy taxes in addition we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments which may be substantial prior to contesting the validity of such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “paytoplay” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes we continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs which may include “paytoplay” payments associated with complying with and defending our position regarding the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are involved in various legal proceedings including but not limited to the legal proceedings described in discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations the defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and expensive if these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial positions 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition or for certain companies at their discretion an imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

in addition we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites for transactions where we are merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our customers additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected 

  

our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many different countries significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made in addition there have been proposals to amend us tax laws that would significantly impact how us companies are taxed on foreign earnings we are earning an increasing portion of our income in foreign countries although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance could impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers these interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical breakins electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and operate profitably 

expedia inc websites including in particular the tripadvisor media network compete for advertising revenue with large internet portal sites such as america online and msn that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies these companies have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases we also compete with search engines like google bing and yahoo search that offer payperclick advertising services in addition we compete with newspapers magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies including print media companies enter the online advertising market competition could result in reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share or less use of our sites by travel companies and travelers if we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors our business could be materially adversely affected in addition the tripadvisor media network is increasingly reliant on natural and paid search traffic from major search engines whose per unit costs have been increasing finally to the extent google bing and other leading search engines attempt to more directly appeal to travel consumers by supporting transactions within their own websites or referring those leads to suppliers directly that could have a meaningfully adverse impact on our advertising businesses 

  

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty media corporation may effectively control the company 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty media corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of the board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 59 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of january 20 2010 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty media corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from us mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman and chief executive officer of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that messrs diller and kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both iac and expedia stock could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of messrs diller and kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia both messrs diller and kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between iac and expedia 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between iac and expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

we may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control particularly in light of existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases dividends or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels or further weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital more recent experience suggests credit spreads can be significantly higher for companies with lower credit ratings impacting returns for bondholders and increasing the cost of potential future debt issuances 

  

in addition we have experienced and may experience declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow the extent of such impact is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business payment terms with suppliers and relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2009 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 895 million risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses or maximize stockholder value 

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to 

  

accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

we have foreign exchange risk 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling the euro canadian dollar australian dollar and chinese renminbi 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in merchant hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel principally europe to the united states and the united states to europe travel 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition as we have seen in some recent periods in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business has made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

we are exposed to the risk of failure to perform by various financial counterparties including for our insurance coverages investments bank deposits letters of credit and foreign exchange risk management as it relates to foreign exchange we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as of december 31 2009 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of 136 million and the fair value of which was approximately 250000 the counterparties to these contracts were jpmorgan chase barclays rbs banc of america us bank bank of tokyomitsubishi hsbc and bnp paribas upon the maturity of these or subsequent contracts the counterparties are potentially obligated to pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these forward contracts in addition due to the weakening economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

our investments in china create risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in china 

we have two principal businesses operating in china elong an online transactional travel business and tripadvisor china which operates a media site under the brand daodaocom and a metasearch site under the brand kuxun the success of these businesses and any future investments we make in china are subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application development and interpretation of china’s laws and regulations significant uncertainties exist in the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws and regulations including requirements to permits and licenses and such uncertainties could limit the available legal protections relating to our investments moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet media foreign investment taxation labor and currency exchange and regulation including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in addition the laws and regulations of 

  

china restrict foreign investment in areas including the airticketing travel agency internet content provision mobile communication and related businesses although we have established effective control through a series of agreements between the companies in which our chinese investments are held and their affiliated chinese entities future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure these entities or to engage in strategic transactions finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china 

our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches 

in the processing of our traveler transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and we rely on information collected online for purposes of advertising to visitors to our websites this information is increasingly subject to legislation regulations and industry policies in numerous jurisdictions around the world these requirements and restrictions are not necessarily consistently applied this government and industry action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation regulations or other requirements are expanded to require changes in our current business practices or if governing jurisdictions or industry groups interpret or implement their requirements in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues for regulators and consumers we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the protections that should apply to travel andor online data 

we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches in addition certain of our acquired companies may not have the same standards related to data collection storage and transfer that expedia has historically maintained failure to improve their standards or a substantial data breach in any of our businesses could significantly harm our business damage our reputation expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability andor cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands 

these and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties 

our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions to the extent that we grow through acquisitions we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy we would also face operational risks such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses disrupting their ongoing businesses increased complexity of our business impairing management resources and their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management further the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business may divert management time and other resources some acquisitions may not be successful and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value 

certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are

our websites rely on content and technology intellectual property much of which we regard as proprietary we protect our proprietary technology by relying on trademarks copyrights trade secret laws patents and confidentiality agreements in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and distribution of our technology documentation and other proprietary information even with all of these precautions it is possible for someone else to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or content without our authorization or to develop similar technology independently effective trademark copyright patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the internet and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information this misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future we may need to go to court to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we currently license from third parties some of the technologies incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies we may be required to license additional technology we cannot be sure that such technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

beginning on september 20 2004 twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against iacinteractivecorp “iac” and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the federal securities laws these cases arose out of iac’s august 4 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of iac’s stock was artificially inflated by preannouncement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by iac’s travel businesses on december 20 2004 the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits appointed colead plaintiffs and designated colead plaintiffs’ counsel see in re iacinteractivecorp securities litigation no 04cv7447 sdny expedia is not a party to this litigation however under the terms of its separation agreement with iac expedia has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities if any associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the spinoff of expedia from iac the “spinoff” of the businesses or entities that comprise expedia following the spinoff

 part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

expedia inc is an online travel company empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research plan book and experience travel we have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers offline retail travel agents and travel service providers we make available on a standalone and package basis travel products and services provided by numerous airlines lodging properties car rental companies destination service providers cruise lines and other travel product and service companies we also offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source 

  

of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the tripadvisor media network and on our transactionbased websites for additional information about our portfolio of brands see the disclosure set forth in part i item 1 business under the caption “management overview” 

all percentages within this section are calculated on actual unrounded numbers 

trends 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and suppliers of travel products and services has been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change in addition beginning in late 2008 global economic and financial market conditions worsened markedly creating uncertainty for travelers and suppliers this macroeconomic downturn has pressured discretionary spending on travel and advertising with initial weakness in the united states and the united kingdom markets increasing and spreading to all geographies although recent macroeconomic trends have been generally stable to slightly improving unemployment remains at historically high levels and consumer spending remains pressured as such our nearterm visibility remains limited 

in late april 2009 the world health organization acknowledged an outbreak of swine influenza “h1n1” which was categorized as a pandemic in june 2009 with reported cases in mexico and eight other countries in response travel advisories were issued by several countries against nonessential travel primarily to mexico expedia observed an increase in cancellation activity from both customers traveling to higher risk destinations and customers in apac regions which have a heightened sensitivity to virus risk however the pandemic does not seem to have intensified and any related cancellation activity has abated 

airline sector 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil us airlines responded to chronic overcapacity financial losses and extreme volatility in oil prices by aggressively reducing their cost structures and seating capacities reduced seating capacities are generally negative for expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers most carriers aggressively reduced capacities in 2008 and 2009 and at this time plans for revisiting capacity expansion in 2010 appear to be relatively limited 

in 2008 many carriers raised their per seat yields by increasing fares assessing fuel surcharges and increasing the use of a la carte pricing for such items as baggage food and beverage and preferred seating to a large degree the use of ancillary fees to supplement revenues have remained and in some cases been expanded however as overall travel demand waned at the end of 2008 and into 2009 carriers began lowering ticket prices in order to attract more leisure travelers 

expedia generally favors a low fare environment as low fares tend to encourage leisure travel leave more of the travel budget for hotel spend and because our air revenues are tied principally to ticket volumes not prices hence the 2009 fare environment was a favorable one for expedia as airfares on tickets sold by expedia decreased 15 in 2009 more recently however given the stabilization in the macro economy and aggressive capacity reductions carriers have been cutting fares less aggressively in the fourth quarter of 2009 fares were down just 4 and our expectations are for fares to begin growing again in 2010 

in addition to capacity and pricing actions carriers have responded to industry conditions by aggressively reducing costs in every aspect of their operations including distribution costs prior to 2008 airlines lowered and in some cases eliminated travel agent commissions and overrides and increased direct distribution through their proprietary websites carriers also reduced payments to gds intermediaries which have historically passed on a portion of these payments to large travel agents including expedia 

in 2009 expediacom and other major online travel agencies began offering air tickets to consumers without an associated online booking fee matching the airline supplier sites which also do not charge online booking fees expedia has broadened this fee elimination to many of its international websites as well as removed most 

  

changecancel fees in excess of those charged by travel suppliers these fee actions combined with the above reductions in distribution costs have combined to reduce expedia’s global revenue per ticket by over 30 in the past three years 

as a result of the above industry dynamics and the strength of our other product lines in 2009 air revenue constituted just 12 of our global revenues we may encounter additional pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew in 2010 and beyond and as air carriers and gdss renegotiate their longterm agreements in 2011 

in addition to the above challenges larger carriers participating in the expedia marketplace have generally reduced their share of total air seat capacity while leading lowcost carriers such as southwest in the united states have increased their relative capacities but have generally chosen not to participate in the expedia marketplace this trend has negatively impacted our ability to obtain supply in our air business and increased the relative attractiveness of other online and offline sales channels 

hotel sector 

in 2008 the hotel sector witnessed supply growth and slowing demand resulting in declining occupancy rates adr growth which had been robust in 2006 and 2007 slowed considerably throughout 2008 and by the end of the year had stopped growing entirely some key leisure travel markets for expedia such as las vegas and hawaii have experienced dramatic yearonyear declines in adrs in 2009 we experienced a 15 decline in global adrs due primarily to weak travel demand and continued supply expansion 

while lower occupancies have historically increased the availability of discounted hotel rooms and a lower rate of adr growth can positively impact underlying room night growth lower adrs also decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room price revenue per room night in 2009 declined 17 primarily due to the downward movement in adrs as well as adverse movements in foreign exchange rates and lower fees 

in 2009 the industry declines in occupancies and adrs were more severe than those experienced after the 911 terror events and although adrs appear to have stabilized somewhat throughout 2009 they are still expected to be down in the low to mid single digits for at least the first half of 2010 these trends combined with softer demand in a weakening economy and lower air capacity into our core leisure travel destinations create a challenging backdrop for our hotel business which generates nearly twothirds of our worldwide revenue and an even greater percentage of our profitability 

online travel 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2009 approximately 56 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online compared with approximately 32 of european travel online penetration in the asia pacific region is estimated to lag behind that of europe these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future 

in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services and supplier growth outpaced online agency growth for several years as a result according to phocuswright by 2009 travel supplier sites accounted for 61 of total online travel spend in the united states more recently due to booking fee reductions and eliminations online agents appear to be regaining share of overall online travel spend our visibility on whether these share gains continue once we pass the anniversary of the fee actions in late 2010 is limited 

differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies have in some 

  

cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies although in most cases they are not providing actual travel booking services some of these competitors have raised significant amounts of capital and have begun to aggressively market their service offerings in early 2009 tripadvisorcom launched a competitive metasearch travel offering featuring a fee estimator enabling customers to see the price of their flight including various airline fees such as baggage charges 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models in particular the agency hotel model has seen rapid adoption in europe and expedia has only recently introduced a competitive offering while agency hotel is an important component of our european strategy we expect it will take time to gain traction with incremental hotel suppliers and for expedia to drive meaningful demand to those hotels 

intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins in 2009 we experienced a reversal of these trends due to several factors including the softer macro environment lower ad rates and a pullback in spend by some of our online competitors impacted by lower fee revenues but there can be no assurance that reversal will continue in the future 

strategy 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure unmanaged business or managed business travelers we are committed to providing travelers travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio technology and content innovation global reach and breadth of product offering in addition we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations activities suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand 

we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews in the united states hotelscom generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone 

through egencia we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in north america europe and the asia pacific region further our tripadvisor media network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and usergenerated content 

we believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models allowing them to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency merchant and advertising business models we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

technology and content innovation expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expedia’s introduction of its “expedia easy manage” program offering smaller properties in secondary and 

  

tertiary markets in europe and asia pacific through an agency model hotel program media solutions introduction of rich media display ads called storepoint expandables tripadvisor’s launch of its family vacation critic which offers reviews of kidfriendly and parenttested hotels resorts attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation and flipkey’s launch of selfservice listings for vacation property owners to merchandise their offerings 

we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience supplier integration and presentation platform improvements search engine marketing and search engine optimization 

global reach our expedia hotelscom and tripadvisor media network brands operate both in north america and internationally we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong and through our tripadvisor brands daodaocom and kuxuncn and we offer hotels to europeanbased travelers through our whollyowned subsidiary venere which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008 in 2009 approximately 34 of our worldwide gross bookings and 37 of worldwide revenue were international 

egencia our corporate travel business operates in north america europe the middle east africa and the asia pacific region using direct points of sale as well as strategic partnerships we believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of egencia 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings as well as proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches may occur under any of our brands or through acquisition of third party brands as in the case of elong venere kuxun and egencia 

breadth of product offering we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer including via our 247 1800 telesales service which is an integral part of the company’s appeal to travelers 

over 60 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we facilitate travel products and services either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction however we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our venere brand as well as our expedia and hotelcom brands we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as expediacom and hotelscom which have historically been focused on transaction revenue in 2009 advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11 of worldwide revenue 

  

seasonality 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer as a result revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

marketing promotions 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services which include inducement offers inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates we allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used 

  

loyalty program accruals 

we offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers such as our hotelscom welcomerewards program welcomerewards offers travelers one free night at any hotelscom partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights subject to certain restrictions as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions we determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including i the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed and ii an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques the actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our estimates 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

indefinitelived intangible assets we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an 

  

asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge for additional information about our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008 see note 5 — goodwill and intangible assets net in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

other longterm liabilities 

various legal and tax contingencies we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

occupancy tax some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer 

  

payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce it is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

stockbased compensation 

in the first quarter of 2009 we awarded stock options as our primary form of employee stockbased compensation we measure the value of stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the blackscholes option valuation model we amortize the fair value net of estimated forfeitures over the remaining term on a straightline basis the blackscholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term if any of the assumptions used in the blackscholes model change significantly stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised

segments 

beginning in the first quarter of 2009 we have three reportable segments leisure the tripadvisor media network and egencia the change from two reportable segments north america and europe was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands we determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance 

  

our leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including expediacom and hotelscom in the united states and localized expedia and hotelscom websites throughout the world expedia affiliate network hotwirecom venere elong and classic vacations 

our tripadvisor media network segment provides advertising services to travel suppliers on its websites which aggregate traveler opinions and unbiased travel articles about cities hotels restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through tripadvisorcom and its localized international versions as well as through its various travel media content properties within the tripadvisor media network 

our egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region 

reclassifications 

during the first quarter of 2009 our development and information technology teams were effectively combined to better support our global brands as a result of our reorganization in addition to costs to develop and maintain our website and internal use applications technology and content expense now also includes the majority of information technology costs such as costs to support and operate our network and backoffice applications including related data center costs system monitoring and network security and other technology leadership and support functions the most significant reclassification of costs occurred between general and administrative expense and technology and content expense as historically a significant portion of the information technology costs were within general and administrative expense technology costs to operate our live site and call center applications in production remained in cost of revenue for a detail of the amounts reclassified for the year ended december 31 2008 and 2007 see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

operating metrics 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating expedia gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

   

 

 the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an 18 growth in transactions substantially offset by lower prices for airline tickets and hotel room nights the increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and travel product prices 

the decrease in revenue margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the reduction in traveler fees the impact of our loyalty programs and a greater mix of lower margin hotels partially offset by lower air ticket prices and a reduction in the mix of lower margin air product the increase in revenue margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue 

results of operations 

revenue 

 

 in 2009 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases within our leisure segment in hotel car and advertising and media revenue and an increase within our tripadvisor media segment in advertising and media revenue these increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 2 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 23 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of packages and room nights booked through venere which we acquired in september 2008 partially offset by a 17 decline in revenue per room night revenue per room night declined largely due to a 15 decrease in adrs including a reduction in traveler fees excluding room nights stayed through venere room nights grew 20 for the year 

worldwide air revenue decreased 13 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 24 decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by a 15 increase in ticket volumes expediacom eliminated consumer booking fees on online air tickets in march 2009 with certain other points of sale following at various dates into the third quarter of 2009 which primarily drove the decline in revenue per ticket this elimination of fees on expediacom and other points of sale combined with lower average ticket prices contributed to the increase in our air ticketing volumes 

worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services and agency cruise increased by 5 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue 

in 2008 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 6 in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase was primarily due to a 13 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages partially offset 

  

by a 6 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased due to changes in foreign exchange rates and a 2 decrease in worldwide adrs 

worldwide air revenue increased 2 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 2 increase in revenue per air ticket tickets sold were flat for the year as an 8 growth in the first half of the year was offset by an 8 decline in the second half of the year due to lower passenger volumes as a result of carrier capacity cuts and softer consumer demand 

our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue discussed above increased by 29 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue 

in addition to the above segment and product revenue discussion our revenue by business model is as follows 

 

 our merchant revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 was relatively flat as increases in car revenue were offset by decreases in air revenue the increase in merchant revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by an increase in hotel revenue primarily due to higher room nights stayed partially offset by lower adrs 

agency revenue decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in air revenue primarily resulting from our expediacom us booking fee removal and decreased agency package revenue partially offset by higher hotel revenue related to venere and higher car revenue agency revenue increased for 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in air hotel and car revenue 

advertising and media revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 21 increase in advertising revenue at our leisure transactionbased websites as well as a 6 increase at tripadvisor media network advertising and media revenue increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased revenue at tripadvisor media network 

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 customer operations including our customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors 2 credit card processing including merchant fees charge backs and fraud and 3 other costs primarily including data center costs to support our websites certain promotions destination supply and stockbased compensation 

in 2009 the primary drivers of the decrease in cost of revenue expense were a decrease in credit card processing costs as a result of our technology investments lower promotions expense and air fulfillment efficiencies primarily resulting from bringing some of our air ticket fulfillment operations inhouse we expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010 

  

in 2008 the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were an increase in customer operation costs primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes during 2008 versus 2007 an increase of credit card processing fees due to the increase in merchant bookings and an increase in promotions expense 

selling and marketing 

 

 selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs including traffic generation costs from search engines and internet portals television radio and print spending private label and affiliate program commissions public relations and other costs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel and related overhead in our partner services group “psg” the tripadvisor media network egencia and expedia local expert and stockbased compensation costs 

selling and marketing expenses decreased 78 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower offline brand spending for our global websites lower online spend as well as lower private label and affiliate expenses associated with the lower overall travel demand environment offline and online advertising spend decreased primarily as a result of a lower cost advertising environment our investments in search engine optimization and marketing and costs for other customer value enhancements that stimulate demand but do not impact selling and marketing expense such as fee reductions and loyalty programs these decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct costs for venere we expect selling and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2010 in part due to approximately 20 million in relocation and other costs related to the opening of a global headquarters for our lodging supply group 

in 2008 selling and marketing expense increased 110 million primarily due to a 64 million increase in direct costs resulting from an increase in online marketing primarily driven by increase spend related to the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increased expenses at our international points of sale offset slight by a decrease in other direct marketing indirect costs included in selling and marketing expense increased 46 million primarily due to increased headcount in the tripadvisor media network psg egencia and european points of sale 

technology and content 

 

 technology and content expense includes product development and content expense as well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure backoffice applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead depreciation and amortization of technology assets including hardware and purchased and internally developed software and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stockbased compensation 

  

the yearoveryear increase of 32 million in technology and content expense in 2009 was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets as well as increased incentive compensation expense we expect technology and content expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010 

the yearoveryear increase of 42 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased personnelrelated expenses primarily in our higher growth businesses including the tripadvisor media network as well as an increase in the amortization of software development costs 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including our executive leadership finance legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting and other costs including stockbased compensation 

in 2009 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal fees settlements and other professional fees of 16 million including costs related to the consumer class action lawsuit and occupancy tax matters as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased incentive compensation expense we expect general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010 

in 2008 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in personnel and overhead costs of 16 million personnel and overhead costs increased due to increased headcount related to the continued expansion of our tripadvisor media network and european points of sale including through acquisitions such as venere as well as higher incentive compensation at certain points of sale 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 in 2009 and 2008 the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology and supplier relationship intangible assets partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions in 2009 the completion of amortization related to certain distribution agreements also contributed to the decrease for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 — acquisitions and other investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

occupancy tax assessments and legal reserves 

during 2009 we recognized 48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the san francisco occupancy tax proceedings and an accrual of 19 million for the estimated settlement cost of the expedia consumer class action lawsuit for additional information see note 14 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

restructuring charges 

during 2009 in conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands and the resulting centralization of locations and brand management marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers we recognized 34 million in restructuring charges these charges were primarily related to employee severance and related benefits restructuring charges related to the brand reorganization were substantially completed by the end of 2009 for additional information see note 12 — restructuring charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets 

in 2008 we recorded impairments of approximately 3 billion of longterm assets which consisted of 28 billion of goodwill 223 million of intangible assets and 11 million related to capitalized software impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our indefinitelived trade names for additional information about our impairments see note 5 — goodwill and intangible assets net in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we recorded no such impairments in 2009 

operating income loss 

 

 in 2009 the change to operating income was due to the prior year impairment of longterm assets of approximately 3 billion in addition selling and marketing expense and cost of revenue decreased compared to the increase in revenue partially offset by the san francisco occupancy tax assessments restructuring charges and class action settlement legal reserve as well as growth in technology and content and general and administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth 

in 2008 the recording of a significant operating loss and the resulting yearoveryear decline was due to the impairment of longterm assets of approximately 3 billion 

interest income and expense 

 

 interest income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average interest rates 

interest expense increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily resulting from interest on the 400 million senior unsecured notes issued in june 2008 the increase in 2009 was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our revolving credit facility at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 our longterm indebtedness totaled 895 million 1545 billion and 1085 billion 

  

other net 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 in 2008 in connection with the closing of an acquisition and the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase price we recognized a net loss of 21 million included in foreign exchange rate losses net 

in 2007 we recognized a 12 million gain related to federal excise tax refunds from the internal revenue service 

provision for income taxes 

 

 in 2009 our effective tax rate was lower than the 35 federal statutory rate primarily due to a fourth quarter deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary partially offset by state income taxes the change in the 2009 effective rate compared to the 2008 rate was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in 2008 of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 415 and our 2009 effective rate was lower than this rate primarily due to the deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary and to a lesser extent lower accruals related to uncertain tax positions we expect our effective tax rate to benefit in 2010 and beyond based on changes in our business structure combined with the relative growth in our international business 

in 2008 our effective tax rate differed from the 35 statutory rate and the 2007 effective rate due to the impairment of goodwill of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 415 which was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions and higher than our 2007 rate primarily due to higher accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

in 2007 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes taxes related to our foreign operations and nondeductible losses related to our derivative liabilities 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 688 million and 758 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 including 148 million and 145 million of cash and shortterm investment balances of majorityowned subsidiaries and our revolving credit facility 

  

as of december 31 2009 we maintained a 1 billion revolving credit facility of which 958   million was available this represents the total 1 billion facility less 42 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” during 2009 we amended our credit facility to replace our tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest coverage covenant among other changes as part of this amendment our leverage ratio was tightened pricing on our borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid approximately 6 million in fees outstanding credit facility borrowings bore interest reflecting our financial leverage based on our december 31 2009 financial statements the interest rate would equate to a base rate plus 2625 basis points at our discretion we could choose a base rate equal to 1 the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or libor plus 100 basis points or 2 various durations of libor 

in february 2010 we reached agreement on a new 750 million threeyear revolving credit facility replacing our prior credit facility pricing is based on the company’s credit ratings with drawn amounts bearing interest at libor plus 300 basis points and undrawn amounts bearing interest at 50 basis points financial covenants remain the same under the new facility we incurred approximately 8 million in fees which will be amortized over the life of the credit facility we currently have no borrowings outstanding under the facility 

our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies in october 2009 our longterm ratings from moody’s and standard and poor’s were raised to ba1 and bbb respectively both agencies issued a stable ratings outlook at that time changes in our operating results cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies should our credit ratings be adjusted downward we may incur higher costs to borrow which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

on february 10 2010 the executive committee acting on behalf of the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share of outstanding common stock the first dividend in our history future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination of our board of directors based on our current shares outstanding we estimate this quarterly dividend payment will be approximately 20 million 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we pay after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows if this business model declines relative to our other businesses or if there are changes to the model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers our working capital benefits could be reduced 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above may affect working capital which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

as of december 31 2009 we had a deficit in our working capital of 610 million compared to a deficit of 367 million as of december 31 2008 primarily due to the repayment of 650 million of borrowings under our credit facility and capital expenditures partially offset by cash generated from operations during 2009 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code and search engine marketing and optimization efforts our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions share repurchases or expenditures in support of our business strategy in the event we have acquisitions or share repurchases this may reduce our cash balance andor increase our debt 

  

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 155 million primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes and growth in operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization partially offset by an increase in income tax and interest payments as well as occupancy tax assessments in 2008 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 191 million primarily due to a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities including an increase in tax payments and faster invoice and payment processing for our hotel suppliers 

in connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments certain jurisdictions may assert that taxpayers are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances which is referred to as “paytoplay” these jurisdictions may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and even when such payments are made we will continue to defend our position vigorously during 2009 we paid 48 million related to tax assessments in san francisco 

in 2009 cash used in investing activities represented a positive change of 812 million in cash flows primarily due to a 493 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions cash provided by the net maturities of shortterm investments of 47 million in 2009 compared to 93 million in purchases in 2008 and a decrease in capital expenditures of 68 million in 2008 cash used in investing activities increased by 680 million primarily due to a 479 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions including 93 million as a contingent payment for the financial performance of a company we acquired during 2007 as well as the purchase of shortterm investments of 93 million by elong and an increase in capital expenditures of 73 million 

cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily included the repayment of 650 million of borrowings under the credit facility cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included 457 million of net borrowings of debt cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares in two tender offers where we acquired 55 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 1385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers in addition we paid withholding taxes for stock option exercises of 121 million on behalf of our chairman and senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled these were offset in part by 585 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility 55 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and 96 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards of which approximately 92 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our chairman and senior executive 

in june 2008 we privately placed 400 million of 85 senior unsecured notes due in july 2016 the “85 notes” the 85 notes were issued at 98572 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in january and july of each year beginning january 1 2009 we used the proceeds net of the discount and issuance costs of 392 million to repay the then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of 330 million with the remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2009 showed a net increase of 87 million primarily due to the relative appreciation in foreign currencies during 2009 compared to their depreciation in 2008 

  

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2008 showed a net decrease of 100 million primarily due to a sharp depreciation in foreign currencies during the second half of 2008 compared with appreciating foreign currencies throughout 2007 and included a 21 million loss related to euro cash holdings during the third quarter of 2008 to economically hedge the purchase price of an acquisition 

we currently have authorization for which there is no fixed termination date from our board of directors to repurchase up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock no such repurchases have been made under this authorization the number of shares we may make under this authorization is subject to certain of our debt covenants 

we also have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec under which expedia inc may offer from time to time debt securities guarantees of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants the shelf registration statement expires on october 15 2010 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the credit market disruptions which were more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009 there can be no assurance however that future borrowings including refinancings if any will be available on terms acceptable to us 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk management 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

in june 2008 we issued 400 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 85 in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 85 notes and our 7456 notes were approximately 431 million and 546 million as of december 31 2009 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 85 notes by approximately 11 million and our 7456 notes by approximately 18 million 

in july 2005 we entered into a 1 billion revolving credit facility interest on the facility was determined by market interest rates plus a spread based on our financial leverage in february 2010 we entered into a new 750 million revolving credit facility which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our outstanding borrowing under the prior revolving credit facility were 0 and 650 million we currently have no borrowings outstanding under the new facility 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 or 2007 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally during 2008 we began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue 

  

exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash and accounts receivable for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated operating liabilities these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we had a net forward asset of less than 1 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of 1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 1 million based on our foreign currency forward positions excluding the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2009 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of 30 million 20 million excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue 47 million and 22 million as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

business strategy 

 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure unmanaged business or managed business travelers we are committed to providing travelers travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio our technology and commitment to continuous innovation our global reach and our breadth of product offering in addition we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations activities suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings 

 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire ® brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand 

 

we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content about lodging properties such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews in the united states hotelscom generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone 

 

through egencia we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in north america europe and the asia pacific region further the tripadvisor media network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and usergenerated content 

 

we believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models allowing them to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency merchant and advertising business models we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

 

technology and continuous innovation expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expediacom’s travelads tm sponsored search product for hotel advertisers hotwire’s air price protection hotelscom’s slider tools for improving search results hotelscom’s ipod and iphone applications and the tripadvisor media network’s offering of travel applications for download on social media sites including facebookcom and myspacecom 

 

we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience supplier integration and presentation platform improvements search engine marketing and search engine optimization 

 

global reach our expedia hotelscom and tripadvisor media network brands operate both in north america and internationally we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong and we offer hotels to europeanbased travelers through our whollyowned subsidiary venere which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008 in 2008 our european segment accounted for approximately 21 of worldwide gross bookings and 23 of worldwide revenue 

 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce 

future launches may occur under any of our brands or through acquisition of thirdparty brands as in the case of elong and venere 

 

egencia our corporate travel business currently operates in australia belgium canada china france germany india ireland italy the netherlands spain switzerland the united kingdom and the united states we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of egencia 

 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services and offering proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

 

breadth of product offering we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer including via our 247 1800 telesales service which is an integral part of the company’s appeal to travelers 

 

over 60 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we facilitate travel products and services either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and package businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction however through venere we are working to grow our agency hotel business particularly in europe we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as expediacom and hotelscom which have historically been focused on transaction revenue in 2008 advertising and media revenue accounted for nearly 10 of worldwide revenue 

 

merchant and agency business models 

 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

 

as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency model 

 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being 

provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models we are also expanding our use of thirdparty provided preassembled package offerings particularly through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers 

 

our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets hotel cruise and car rental reservations airline ticket transactions currently make up the majority of this business in the third quarter of 2008 we acquired venere an agencybased online hotel business in europe although net revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 57 of total gross bookings for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

relationships with travel suppliers distribution and fulfillment partners 

 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines lodging properties car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs our partner services group consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in our seasonal and eventdriven promotions 

 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet our travelers can now book reservations with over 50000 merchant hotel properties worldwide of which approximately 46 are now fully directconnected 

 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or “segments” the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products 

 

we use sabre and amadeus as our primary gds segment providers prior to 2007 we primarily used worldspan we added the additional gdss in order to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers 

 

fulfillment partners we outsource a portion of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to thirdparty suppliers such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services 

 

marketing and promotions 

 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner 

our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization offline advertising direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships in addition we offer several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers including the thankyou rewards on expediacom welcomerewards on hotelscom and nectar in the united kingdom 

 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites we have agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an expediabranded website a cobranded website or their own private label website we also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services 

 

operations and technology 

 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we provide this support infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers which are located in various locations throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines and el salvador we have made significant investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and have plans to continue these investments in 2009 and beyond 

 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations mainly in the united states which have communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities for some critical systems we have both production and disasterrecovery facilities 

 

we have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace for example our best fare search technology essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the united states from gds partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to reassemble multileg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler we are looking to expand this technology internationally we are also investing in improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive rates for our travelers 

 

we continue to invest in our operations and technology infrastructure and we anticipate additional travelerfacing benefits in 2009 

 

competition 

 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad 

 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services and other companies offering travel search engines including metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning 

content and advice the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

 

our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs lower or no transaction fees and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers as opposed to a single supplier and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors or business models and supplier consolidation 

 

intellectual property rights 

 

we regard our intellectual property rights including our patents service marks trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success for example we rely heavily upon the software code informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service 

 

we rely on a combination of laws business practices and contractual obligations with employees suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets despite these precautions it may be possible for a thirdparty to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining our current registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses while we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names effective trademark and domain name protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract in addition our infringement monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or may be registered by us even if available the failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names andor limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names 

 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

 

regulation 

 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure 

requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including in some countries laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

 

we generate our revenue through a diverse customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers no customer represented 10 or more of our total revenue in the periods presented in this annual report on form 10k

 part i item 1a   risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

 

global economic conditions may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance 

 

travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns including downturns in any of our major markets in the second half of 2008 there was a rapid softening of domestic and global economic conditions and the outlook for 2009 is uncertain this slowing of the domestic and global economies has increased unemployment and reduced the financial capacity of both corporate and leisure travelers thereby slowing spending on the services we provide the continuation or worsening of domestic and global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our businesses and financial performance 

 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry including by decreases in hotel occupancy rates hotel average daily rates decreases in airline capacity or rising airline ticket prices all of which we have recently experienced events or weakness specific to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our business also include continued fare increases travelrelated strikes or labor unrest bankruptcies or liquidations and fuel price volatility additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus our business has in the past and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as avian flu such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected travelers by not charging cancellation fees andor by refunding the price of airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services including online travel agencies travel suppliers large online portal and search companies traditional travel agencies meta search companies and operators of travel industry reservation databases some of our competitors particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as the various expedia sites for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee and in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than offerings like ours in addition we face increasing competition from other travel agencies which in some cases may have favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing connectivity and supply breadth we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply increasing competition from current and emerging competitors the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may force us to 

make changes to our business models including changing our approaches to service fees increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base 

 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers 

 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites over the last several years air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced or in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries in addition as our hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers average daily rates or “adrs” meaning that our revenue for each room will generally be proportionately higher or lower depending on the level of the adr the recent significant decline in adrs has accordingly negatively impacted our hotel booking revenue to the extent adrs decline even further as we think is likely in 2009 our hotel booking revenue will be further negatively impacted during the recent decline we have experienced a drop in adrs generally faster than the overall industry due to a number of factors including the increased use of our distribution channels for promotional activities by hotels we expect this trend to continue until the hotel industry begins to rebound also each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that gds partners or travel suppliers will not further reduce or eliminate compensation attempt to charge travel agencies for content or further reduce their adrs any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance adverse changes in existing relationships increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms if at all could reduce the amount quality and breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that we are able to offer which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

 

we believe continued investment in our brands including expediacom hotelscom hotwirecom classic vacations egencia elong venere the tripadvisor media network and expedia local expert is critical to retain and expand our traveler supplier and advertiser bases we have and expect to continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value due to a variety of factors these include increased spending from our competitors the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and meta search engines as destination sites for travelers we have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of our brands and we will continue to spend money on and devote resources to advertising and marketing as well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as costeffective as they have been historically if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics 

 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines such as google principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines including google frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of our business is directed to our own websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and competitively if a major search engine such as google which we utilize for a significant amount of our search engine traffic changes its algorithms 

in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected 

 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for reservations communications procurement and administration as our operations grow in both size and scope we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings 

 

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we are currently in the process of migrating portions of our site functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising capability among other anticipated benefits we have experienced some delays with this migration delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future if any of these events occur our business could suffer 

 

we rely on thirdparties for many systems and services 

 

we rely on thirdparty service providers for certain customer care fulfillment processing development technology and other services if these thirdparties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business in addition if such thirdparty service providers were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or other business disruption we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations in addition we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of traveler care and information technology services if we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we ineffectively manage these partnerships it could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business competition for wellqualified employees in certain aspects of our business including software engineers and other technology professionals also remains intense 

 

our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

we are in the process of restructuring our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses these changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business 

 

our stock price is highly volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors andor invite speculative trading in our common stock or debt instruments 

 

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 

 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence to achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets including supplier relationships and traveler preferences learning the customs and cultures of various countries particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth 

 

we expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations these risks include political instability threatened or actual acts of terrorism changes in regulatory requirements our ability to comply with additional us laws applicable to us companies operating internationally as well as local laws and regulations diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights possible preferences by local populations for local providers restrictions 

on the withdrawal of nonus investment and earnings currency exchange restrictions slower adoption of the internet as an advertising broadcast and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the united states and difficulties in managing staffing and operations due to distance time zones language and cultural differences 

 

changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance 

 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce consumer protection and privacy such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet user privacy taxation and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

 

adverse application of tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial performance 

 

the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax laws rules and regulations were amended if new adverse laws rules or regulations were adopted or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes the results could increase our tax payments prospectively or retrospectively andor subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance in addition we may be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments which may be substantial prior to contesting the validity of such assessments this requirement is commonly referred to as “pay to play” payment of these amounts is not an admission that the tax payer believes it is subject to such taxes we continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs which may include “pay to play” payments associated with complying with and defending our position in the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 

 

provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

 

we have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers these agreements allow these processing companies under certain conditions to hold an amount of our cash referred to as a “holdback” or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company these processing companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events including material adverse changes in our financial condition or for certain companies at their discretion an imposition of a holdback by one or more of our processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity 

 

in addition we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites for transactions where we are merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our customers additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to thirdparties any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance could impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical breakins electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

 

intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and operate profitably 

 

expedia inc websites including in particular the tripadvisor media network compete for advertising dollars with large internet portal sites such as american online msn and yahoo that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies these companies have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases we also compete with search engines like google and yahoo search that offer payperclick advertising services in addition we compete with newspapers magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies including print media companies enter the online advertising market competition could results in reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share or less use of our sites by travel companies and travelers if we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors our business could be materially adversely affected in addition the tripadvisor media network is increasingly reliant on natural and paid search traffic from major search engines whose per unit costs have been increasing 

 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty media corporation may effectively control the company 

 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty media corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of the board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 60 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2008 

 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty media corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement 

equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from us mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman and chief executive officer of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that messrs diller and kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both iac and expedia stock could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of messrs diller and kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia both messrs diller and kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between iac and expedia 

 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between iac and expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

 

we may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable 

 

the availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control particularly in light of existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels or the recent general weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital recently credit spreads for below investment grade issuers such as expedia have increased significantly compared with historical levels impacting returns for bondholders and increasing the cost of potential incremental debt issuance 

 

in addition we have experienced and may experience declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by our merchant hotel business which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow the extent of such impact is dependent on several factors including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business payment terms with suppliers and relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital such as our agency hotel advertising and managed corporate travel businesses 

 

our revolving credit facility expires in august 2010 and any borrowings thereunder will be classified as current during the third quarter of 2009 given the current uncertainty in the credit markets there is no guarantee we will be able to renew our credit facility or renew it at current commitment levels or otherwise on terms acceptable to us in addition a recent amendment to the facility has increased the cost of borrowing under the facility 

we have significant longterm indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2008 the face value of our longterm indebtedness totaled 154 billion risks relating to our longterm indebtedness include 

 

  

in addition it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations if new debt is added to current debt levels the risks described above could intensify 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants the failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants including those that restrict our ability to among other things 

 

  

these covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses 

 

in addition our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test we recently entered into an amendment to our credit facility that tightened a number of the restrictions listed above 

 

any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt which acceleration may trigger crossacceleration or crossdefault provisions in other debt in addition lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings 

we have foreign exchange risk 

 

we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling the euro canadian dollar australian dollar and chinese renminbi 

 

these exposures include but are not limited to remeasurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into us dollars upon consolidation fluctuations in merchant hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on crossborder travel principally europe to the united states and the united states to europe travel 

 

depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates if we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition in addition given the recent severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures have increased and the impact on our results of operations has become more pronounced in addition the current environment and the increasingly global nature of our business has made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly we have increased and plan to continue increasing the scope and complexity of our foreign exchange risk management including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedging activities 

 

we are exposed to various counterparty risks 

 

we are exposed to the risk of failure to perform by various financial counterparties including for our insurance coverages investments bank deposits letters of credit and foreign exchange risk management as it relates to foreign exchange we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as of december 31 2008 we were party to forward contracts with a notional value of 165 million and the fair value of which was a 1 million liability the counterparties to these contracts were goldman sachs banc of america hsbc and fifth third bank upon the maturity of these or subsequent contracts the counterparties are potentially obligated to pay us net settlement values if any of these counterparties were to liquidate declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these forward contracts in addition due to the weakening economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our nonfinancial contract counterparties 

 

our investment in elong creates risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in china 

 

the success of our investment in elong inc a company organized under cayman islands law whose principal business is the operation of an internetbased travel business in china is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the interpretation of china’s laws and regulations significant uncertainties exist in the interpretation and enforcement of chinese laws and regulations and such uncertainties could limit the available legal protections relating to our investment in elong moreover we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet foreign investment or licensing including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict certain direct foreign investment in the airticketing travel agency and internet content provision businesses although we have established effective control through a series of agreements between elong inc and its affiliated chinese entities future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of chinese laws and regulations or a dispute relating to the agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure these entities or to engage in desirable strategic transactions finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of 

judgment of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to enforce in china 

 

our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches 

 

in the processing of our traveler transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel andor online data 

 

we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches in addition certain of our acquired companies may not have the same standards related to data collection storage and transfer that expedia has historically maintained failure to improve their standard or a substantial data breach in any of our businesses could significantly harm our business damage our reputation expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability andor cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands 

 

these and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 part ii item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

expedia inc is an online travel company empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research plan book and experience travel we have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers offline retail travel agents and travel service providers we make available on a standalone and package basis travel products and services provided by numerous airlines lodging properties car rental companies destination service providers cruise lines and other travel product and service companies we also offer travel and nontravel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the tripadvisor media network and on our transactionbased websites for additional information about our portfolio of brands see the disclosure set forth in part i item 1 business under the caption “management overview” 

 

trends 

 

the travel industry including offline agencies online agencies and suppliers of travel products and services has been characterized by intense competition as well as rapid and significant change in addition beginning in september 2008 global economic and financial market conditions worsened markedly creating 

uncertainty for travelers and suppliers this macroeconomic downturn pressured discretionary spending on travel and advertising with weakness we previously identified in the united states and the united kingdom markets increasing and spreading to all geographies we cannot predict the magnitude or duration of the downturn but our current limited visibility does not suggest any nearterm improvement 

 

airline sector 

 

the airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil most recently us airlines have responded to chronic overcapacity financial losses and extreme volatility in oil prices by aggressively reducing their cost structures and seating capacities in addition many carriers have raised their per seat yields by increasing fares in the early part of 2008 assessing fuel surcharges and increasing the use of a la carte pricing for such items as baggage food and beverage and preferred seating 

 

reduced seating capacities are generally negative for expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms car rental and other services on behalf of air travelers carriers have announced incremental capacity reductions in 2009 which will again pressure our inventories and impact our opportunity to sell other travel products 

 

fare increases fuel surcharges and other fees are generally negative for expedia’s business as they may negatively impact traveler demand with no corresponding increase in our remuneration as our air revenue is tied principally to ticket volumes not prices fare increases were especially pronounced through the first three quarters of 2008 but have moderated more recently with slowing demand 

 

in addition to capacity and pricing actions carriers have responded to industry conditions by aggressively reducing costs in every aspect of their operations including distribution costs prior to 2008 airlines lowered and in some cases eliminated travel agent commissions and overrides and increased direct distribution through their proprietary websites carriers also reduced payments to gds intermediaries which have historically passed on a portion of these payments to large travel agents including expedia 

 

primarily as a result of these decreased costs of distribution and reduced access to excess air supply our revenue per air ticket decreased more than 10 in each of 2005 2006 and 2007 as a result of these pressures and the relative growth of our nonair business lines air revenue constituted less than 15 of 2008 global revenue we saw greater stability in air revenue per ticket in 2008 due to our signing longterm agreements with nine of the top ten domestic carriers and three gds providers in prior years as well as an increase in booking fees for expediacom travelers however due to the weakening economy we may encounter additional pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew in 2009 and beyond as well as potential pressure on air booking fees due to actions by some of our competitors and increased traveler sensitivity to fees in the current environment 

 

in addition to the above challenges larger carriers participating in the expedia marketplace have generally reduced their share of total air seat capacity while leading lowcost carriers such as southwest in the united states and easyjet in europe have increased their relative capacities but have generally chosen not to participate in the expedia marketplace this trend has negatively impacted our ability to obtain supply in our air business and increased the relative attractiveness of other online and offline sales channels 

 

hotel sector 

 

in 2008 the hotel sector witnessed supply growth and slowing demand resulting in declining occupancy rates adr growth which had been robust in 2006 and 2007 slowed considerably throughout 2008 and by the end of the year had stopped growing entirely some key leisure travel markets for expedia such as las vegas and hawaii have seen dramatic yearonyear declines in adrs in addition in early 2009 due primarily to continued declines in industry occupancy rates we have continued to see a weakening in our adrs 

 

while lower occupancies have historically increased our supply of merchant hotel rooms and a lower rate of adr growth can positively impact underlying room night growth lower adrs also decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room price adrs on expedia’s worldwide sites grew 7 in 2007 but declined 1 in 2008 including a 10 decrease in the fourth quarter of 

2008 compared to the same period in 2007 our hotel remuneration is also impacted by our hotel margins which declined in 2008 due to adverse movements in foreign exchange rates lower fees and more competitive hotel pricing 

 

industry sources forecast lower occupancies and yearonyear declines in adrs in 2009 these trends combined with softer demand in a weakening economy and lower air capacity into our core leisure travel destinations create a challenging backdrop for our hotel business which has been a key source of revenue and profitability growth for expedia 

 

online travel 

 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2008 approximately 58 of us leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online compared with approximately 33 of european travel online penetration in the asia pacific region is estimated to lag behind that of europe these penetration rates have increased over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future 

 

in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services and supplier growth has outpaced online agency growth since 2002 as a result according to phocuswright by 2008 travel supplier sites accounted for 61 of total online travel spend in the united states phocuswright forecasts that suppliers’ share of online travel has reached an inflection point and will remain relatively constant in 2009 and 2010 

 

differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price newer competitive entrants such as “meta search” companies have in some cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies although in most cases they are not providing actual travel booking services 

 

the online travel industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers which in some cases place pressure on historical business models intense competition has also led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiency and operating margins 

 

strategy 

 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure unmanaged business or managed business travelers we are committed to providing travelers travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio our technology and commitment to continuous innovation our global reach and our breadth of product offering in addition we intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations activities suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings 

 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers suppliers and advertisers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand 

 

we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higherend 

travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews in the united states hotelscom generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone 

 

through egencia we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in north america europe and the asia pacific region further our tripadvisor media network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and usergenerated content 

 

we believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models allowing them to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency merchant and advertising business models we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

 

technology and continuous innovation expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expediacom’s travelads sponsored search product for hotel advertisers hotwire’s air price protection hotelscom’s slider tools for improving search results hotelcom’s ipod and iphone applications and the tripadvisor media network’s offering of travel applications for download on social media sites such as facebookcom and myspacecom 

 

we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience supplier integration and presentation platform improvements search engine marketing and search engine optimization 

 

global reach our expedia hotelscom and tripadvisor media network brands operate both in north america and internationally we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong and we offer hotels to europeanbased travelers through our whollyowned subsidiary venere which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008 in 2008 our european segment accounted for approximately 21 of worldwide gross bookings and 23 of worldwide revenue 

 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches may occur under any of our brands or through acquisition of third party brands as in the case of elong and venere 

 

egencia our corporate travel business currently operates in australia belgium canada china france germany india ireland italy the netherlands spain switzerland the united kingdom and the united states we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of egencia 

 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing new website features adding supplier products and services and offering proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

 

our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

 

breadth of product offering we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our 

worldwide points of sale over time travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer including via our 247 1800 telesales service which is an integral part of the company’s appeal to travelers 

 

over 60 of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations with less than 15 of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets we facilitate travel products and services either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we have emphasized growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction however through venere we are working to grow our agency hotel business particularly in europe we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as expediacom and hotelscom which have historically been focused on transaction revenue in 2008 advertising and media revenue accounted for nearly 10 of worldwide revenue 

 

seasonality 

 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer as a result revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize 

those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

 

marketing promotions 

 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services which include inducement offers inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates we allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used 

 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

 

goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

 

in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt which can be fair value principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill indefinitelived and definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment or in period in which an impairment is recognized could result in a materially different impairment charge for additional information about our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008 see note 5 — goodwill and intangible assets net in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

income taxes 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 accounting for income taxes  we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  in the first quarter of 2007 

 

other longterm liabilities 

 

various legal and tax contingencies we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into 

consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

 

occupancy tax some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax or a form of sales tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments including occupancy tax assessments prior to contesting any such assessments 

 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce it is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

segments 

 

we have two reportable segments north america and europe we determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance 

our north america segment provides a full range of travel andor advertising services to customers primarily located in the united states canada and mexico this segment operates through a variety of brands including classic vacations expediacom hotelscom hotwirecom and the tripadvisor media network 

 

our europe segment provides travel services primarily through localized expedia websites in austria belgium denmark france germany ireland italy the netherlands norway spain sweden and the united kingdom as well as localized versions of hotelscom in various european countries in addition venere is included within our europe segment from its acquisition date in the third quarter of 2008 forward 

 

corporate and other includes egencia expedia asia pacific and unallocated corporate functions and expenses egencia provides travel products and services to corporate customers in north america europe and the asia pacific region expedia asia pacific provides online travel information and reservation services primarily through elong in china localized expedia websites in australia india japan and new zealand as well as localized versions of hotelscom in various asian countries 

 

we are in the process of reorganizing our business around our global brands our chief operating decision makers are assessing our new structure to determine how we will manage our business and report our financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2009 we expect our reportable segments to change as we will no longer manage the business on a geographical basis 

 

operating metrics 

 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics such as gross bookings and revenue margin which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating expedia gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings 

 

reclassifications 

 

we restated our europe segment and total gross bookings for 2007 and 2006 to conform to our current period presentation the restatement had no impact on revenue 

 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 

 

the yearoveryear increases in worldwide gross bookings in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and travel product prices 

the increase in worldwide and north america revenue margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue the decrease in europe revenue margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange 

 

the increase in worldwide and north america revenue margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue partially offset by a decline in revenue per air ticket the decrease in europe revenue margin in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower air commissions and booking fees as well as lower revenue resulting from more competitive hotel pricing 

 

results of operations 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

in 2008 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue 

 

worldwide hotel revenue including both merchant and agency increased 6 in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase was primarily due to a 13 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages partially offset by an 6 decrease in revenue per room night revenue per room night decreased due to changes in foreign exchange rates and a 1 decrease in worldwide adrs 

 

worldwide air revenue increased 2 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 2 increase in revenue per air ticket tickets sold were flat for the year as an 8 growth in the first half of the year was offset by an 8 decline in the second half of the year due to lower passenger volumes as a result of carrier capacity cuts and softer consumer demand 

 

our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue discussed above which includes advertising and media car rental destination services and cruise increased by 29 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue advertising and media revenue increased 55 in 2008 accounting for nearly 10 of worldwide revenue 

 

package revenue declined 4 in 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to foreign exchange and lower worldwide volumes 

 

in 2007 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide hotel revenue and to a lesser extent advertising and media revenue 

 

worldwide hotel revenue increased 19 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase was primarily due to a 11 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages as well as a 7 increase in revenue per room night revenue per room night increased due to a 7 increase in worldwide adrs partially offset by a decline in hotel margin 

 

worldwide air revenue decreased 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 12 decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by an increase of 12 in air tickets sold the decrease in revenue per air ticket primarily reflects decreased compensation from air carriers and gds providers and to a lesser extent reduced air service fees versus the prior year period 

our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue discussed above increased by 43 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in advertising and media revenue as well as car rental revenues 

 

package revenue grew 7 in 2007 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher european package bookings 

 

cost of revenue and gross profit 

 

 

 

cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 costs of our data and call centers including telesales 2 credit card expenses including merchant fees charge backs and fraud 3 fees paid to fulfillment vendors for processing airline tickets and related customer services and 4 costs paid to suppliers for certain destination supply 

 

the yearoveryear increases in cost of revenue were primarily due to higher costs associated with an increase in transaction volumes 

 

the yearoveryear increases in gross profit were primarily due to increased revenue in 2008 the increase in revenue was partially offset by a 51 basis point decrease in gross margin primarily due to cost increases including our summer gas card promotion and costs associated with our data center and other projects gross margin increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue as well as cost savings from our various efficiency initiatives 

 

selling and marketing 

 

 

 

selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct advertising expense including television radio and print spending as well as traffic generation costs from search engines internet portals and our private label and affiliate programs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including personnel in our partner services group “psg” the tripadvisor media network egencia and expedia local expert and stockbased compensation costs 

 

in 2008 and 2007 the increase in selling and marketing was primarily due to increased direct online search spend across our worldwide points of sale as well as higher personnel costs in addition during 2007 brand spend across our worldwide points of sale also increased 

 

general and administrative 

 

 

general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation costs for support functions that include our executive leadership finance legal tax technology and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting 

 

in 2008 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the overall growth of our businesses including personnel and other costs related to our information technology functions as well as costs related to our european businesses and the tripadvisor media network 

 

in 2007 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to expansion of our corporate information technology functions our european businesses and the tripadvisor media network as well as higher incentive compensation expense higher legal expenses and higher payroll taxes related to stock option exercises 

 

technology and content 

 

 

 

technology and content expense consists of expenses for customizing our websites amortization of website and internal software development costs localization of our websites and product development expenses such as personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation 

 

the yearoveryear expense increase in 2008 was due to increased personnelrelated expenses primarily in our higher growth businesses including the tripadvisor media network as well as an increase in the amortization of software development costs 

 

the yearoveryear expense increase in 2007 was primarily due to growth in personnelrelated expenses in our software development and engineering teams as we continued to increase our level of website innovation and increased amortization of capitalized software development costs for additional information about our policy related to capitalized software costs see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 

 

in 2008 and 2007 amortization of intangible assets expense decreased compared to 2007 and 2006 primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology and supplier intangible assets partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 — acquisitions and other investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets 

 

in 2008 we recorded impairments of approximately 3 billion of longterm assets which consisted of 28 billion of goodwill 223 million of intangible assets and 11 million related to capitalized software impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our indefinitelived trade names in 2006 we recognized an impairment charge of 47 million in relation to hotwire’s indefinitelived trade name intangible asset for additional information about our impairments see note 5— goodwill and intangible assets net in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as a result of continued adverse conditions in the markets in which we operate we will continue to monitor goodwill and longlived intangible assets as well as longlived tangible assets for possible future impairment we cannot assure that these assets will not be further impaired in future periods 

 

amortization of noncash distribution and marketing 

 

amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense consisted mainly of advertising from universal television contributed to us by iac at spinoff with an original value of 17 million we used this advertising without any cash cost and during 2006 had fully utilized all media time 

 

operating income loss 

 

 

 

in 2008 the recording of a significant operating loss and the resulting yearoveryear decline was due to the impairment of longterm assets of approximately 3 billion 

 

in 2007 the increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit the impairment charge of 47 million in 2006 and a decrease in amortization of intangibles and amortization of noncash distribution and marketing partially offset by growth in sales and marketing expense and technology and content expense 

 

operating income before amortization “oiba” 

 

 

 

in 2008 the increase in oiba was primarily due to higher revenue partially offset by lower gross margin and increased operating expenses oiba as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower gross margin as well as higher growth in sales and marketing expense and technology and content expense as a percentage of revenue during 2008 

 

in 2007 the increase in oiba was primarily due to an increase in gross profit partially offset by growth in sales and marketing expenses and technology and content expenses oiba as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to growth in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue partially offset by an increase in gross margin 

 

definition of oiba 

 

we provide oiba as a supplemental measure to gaap operating income loss and net income loss we define oiba as operating income loss plus 1 stockbased compensation expense 3 amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment if applicable 4 amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense and 4 certain onetime items if applicable 

 

oiba is the primary operating metric used by which management evaluates the performance of our business on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the comparable gaap measure gaap financial 

statements and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure we present a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to gaap below 

 

oiba represents the combined operating results of expedia inc’s businesses taking into account depreciation of property and equipment including internaluse software and website development which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of other noncash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations we believe this performance measure is useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

oiba has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations including stockbased compensation noncash payments to partners acquisitionrelated accounting and certain onetime items if applicable 

 

reconciliation of oiba to operating income loss and net income loss 

 

the following table presents a reconciliation of oiba to operating income loss and net income loss for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

interest income and expense 

 

 

 

interest income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower average interest rates the yearoveryear increase in 2007 was primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances 

 

interest expense increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to higher average debt balances primarily resulting from the 400 million senior unsecured notes issued in june 2008 in 2007 interest expense increased as compared to 2006 due to interest expense related to the 500 million senior unsecured notes 

issuance in august 2006 and a 500 million draw on our revolving credit facility in august 2007 to fund a portion of the tender offer completed in the third quarter of 2007 at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 our longterm indebtedness totaled 1545 billion 1085 billion and 500 million 

 

other net 

 

other net is comprised of the following 

 

 

 

in 2008 in connection with the closing of an acquisition and the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase price we recognized a net loss of 21 million included in foreign exchange rate gains losses net 

 

in 2007 we recognized a 12 million gain related to federal excise tax refunds from the internal revenue service 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

in 2008 our effective tax rate differed from the 35 statutory rate and the 2007 effective rate due to the impairment of goodwill of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 415 which was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions and higher than our 2007 rate primarily due to higher accruals related to uncertain tax positions 

 

in 2007 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes taxes related to our foreign operations and nondeductible losses related to our derivative liabilities the 2007 effective rate increased as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher state taxes including increases to state tax rates and nondeductible losses related to our derivative liabilities compared with a gain in 2006 

 

in 2006 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and valuation allowance on certain foreign losses partially offset by nontaxable gains related to our derivative liabilities 

 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances which were 758 million and 617 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 which included 140 million and 158 million of cash and shortterm investments at elong whose results are consolidated into our financial statements due to our controlling voting and economic ownership position and our 1 billion revolving credit facility of which 292 million was available as of december 31 2008 this represents the total 1 billion facility less 650 million of outstanding borrowings and 58 million 

of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” we intend to repay 550 million of the outstanding borrowings by february 20 2009 

 

on february 18 2009 we amended our credit facility to replace our tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest coverage covenant among other changes as part of this amendment our leverage ratio was tightened pricing on our borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid approximately 6 million in fees which will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility outstanding credit facility borrowings bear interest reflecting our financial leverage based on our december 31 2008 financial statements and the new amendment the interest rate would equate to a base rate plus 2875 basis points at our discretion we may choose a base rate equal to 1 the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or libor plus 100 basis points or 2 various durations of libor 

 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within two weeks after completing the transaction but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights are completed for most other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business we pay after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business grows we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows however due to various factors including decelerating bookings growth growth in other business models that lack the same working capital benefits as the merchant model and technology and process initiatives which have resulted in quicker payments to hotel suppliers we have experienced a reduction in our working capital impacts to cash flows in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above may affect working capital which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had a deficit in our working capital of 367 million compared to a deficit of 729 million as of december 31 2007 

 

we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code and search engine optimization efforts in addition we relocated many of our global offices including our corporate headquarters to larger facilities in 2008 to accommodate the growth of our business these moves resulted in significant investments to improve the new facilities our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions or expenditures in support of our business strategy in the event we have acquisitions this may reduce our cash balance andor increase our debt 

 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 

in 2008 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 191 million primarily due to a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities including an increase in tax payments and faster invoice and payment processing for our hotel suppliers in the current period in 2007 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 95 million primarily due to an increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in cash flows from operating income partially offset by an increase in interest payments 

 

in 2008 cash used in investing activities increased by 680 million primarily due to a 479 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions including 93 million as a contingent payment for the financial performance of a company we acquired during 2007 as well as the purchase of shortterm investments of 93 million by elong and an increase in capital expenditures of 73 million in 2007 cash used in investing activities increased by 66 million primarily due to a 27 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions and a 32 million increase in longterm investments and deposits mainly related to our 50 investment in a travel company these increases were offset by a decrease of 6 million in capital expenditures 

 

in february 2008 elong announced approval by its board of directors of a share repurchase program of up to 20 million executed purchases are classified as acquisitions in the investing section of our statements of cash flows as of november 25 2008 elong had executed approximately 14 million in purchases under the repurchase program 

 

cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included 457 million of net borrowings of debt 

 

cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares in the first and third quarter tender offers pursuant to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 2200 per share and 25 million tendered shares of our common stock at 2900 per share for a total cost of 1385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers in addition we paid withholding taxes for stock option exercises of 121 million on behalf of our chairman and senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled these were offset in part by 585 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility used primarily to fund a portion of the third quarter tender offer 55 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and 96 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards of which approximately 92 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our chairman and senior executive 

 

cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was primarily due to the net proceeds of 495 million from our senior notes issuance in 2006 and 35 million in proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by 296 million of treasury stock activity primarily related to cash paid to acquire shares in the second and third quarters pursuant to which we acquired in open market trades 20 million shares of our common stock at an average per share price of 1442 for a total cost of 288 million and the 230 million repayment of our revolving credit facility which was initially borrowed in 2005 

 

in june 2008 we privately placed 400 million of 85 senior unsecured notes due in july 2016 the “85 notes” the 85 notes were issued at 98572 of par resulting in a discount which is being amortized over their life interest is payable semiannually in january and july of each year beginning january 1 2009 we used the proceeds net of the discount and issuance costs paid to date of 392 million to repay the then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of 330 million with the remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes 

 

in august 2006 we issued 500 million of 7456 senior unsecured notes due in august 2018 the “7456 notes” for net proceeds of 495 million interest is payable semiannually in february and august of each year which began in february 2007 the 7456 notes are repayable in whole or in part on august 15 2013 at the option of the note holders and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at our option 

 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2008 showed a net decrease of 99 million primarily due to a sharp depreciation in foreign currencies during the second half of 2008 compared with appreciating foreign currencies throughout 2007 and included a 21 million loss related to euro cash holdings during the third quarter of 2008 to economically hedge the purchase price of an acquisition the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2007 

showed a net decrease of 21 million our foreign currency cash balances in 2007 benefited from foreign currency appreciation but to a lesser extent than 2006 due to a different mix of currencies held and relatively less appreciation in certain of the primary foreign currencies in which we transacted 

 

we currently have authorization for which there is no fixed termination date from our board of directors to repurchase up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock no such repurchases have been made under this authorization the amount of repurchase we may make under this authorization are subject to certain of our debt covenants 

 

in connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments certain jurisdictions require that tax payers pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances which is referred to as “pay to play” we have been assessed approximately 82 million in taxes plus 95 million in penalties and interest by the city of anaheim which has a “pay to play” tax ordinance to preserve our right to contest this assessment it is possible that we may be required to make a payment to anaheim as well as to other california jurisdictions that make similar assessments we are challenging the city’s purported right to require us to pay the tax assessment prior to commencing litigation other jurisdictions may also attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and we intend to continue defending our position vigorously 

 

we also have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec under which expedia inc may offer from time to time debt securities guarantees of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants the shelf registration statement expires on october 15 2010 

 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment there can be no assurance however that the cost or availability of future borrowings including refinancings if any will not be impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions

 part ii item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk management 

 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our longterm debt our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in june 2008 we issued 400 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 85 in august 2006 we issued 500 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7456 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair values of our 85 notes and our 7456 notes were approximately 280 million and 365 million as of december 31 2008 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our 85 notes by approximately 7 million and our 7456 notes by approximately 6 million 

 

in july 2005 we entered into a 1 billion revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility bears interest based on market interest rates plus a spread which is determined based on our financial leverage the weighted average interest rate was 134 as of december 31 2008 because our interest rate is tied to a market rate we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2008 and 2007 our outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility were 650 million and 585 million a hypothetical 10 increase in market rates would increase our interest expense by less than 1 million 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

to the extent practicable we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies additionally during the third and fourth quarter of 2008 we began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currencydenominated merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings balances these instruments are typically shortterm and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other net as of december 31 2008 we had a net forward liability of 1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings cancellations refunds and payments in foreign currencies in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges 

 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 8 million based on our foreign currency forward positions and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31 2008 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

 

during 2008 2007 and 2006 we recorded net foreign exchange rate gains losses of 47 million 22 million and 10 million as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

 

the board of directors and stockholders expedia inc 

 

we have audited expedia inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria expedia inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion expedia inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the 2008 consolidated financial statements of expedia inc and our report dated february 18 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

business strategy 

 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure or business we are committed to providing our travelers with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by taking advantage of our critical assets — our brand portfolio our technology and commitment to continuous innovation our global reach and our breadth of product offering in addition we take advantage of our growing base of knowledge about our destinations suppliers and travelers based on our unique position in the travel value chain 

 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to complex bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium content about lodging properties and generally appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations our brands also enable travelers to interact with us how and when they prefer with 247 1800 telesales service which has become an increasingly important part of the company’s growth strategy 

 

we believe our appeal to suppliers is enhanced by our breadth of brands and international points of sale allowing suppliers to offer the industry’s broadest range of online travelers their product and service offerings we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio and expanding our geographic footprint for the benefit of our travelers suppliers and advertisers 

 

technology and continuous innovation expedia has an established tradition of innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expediacom’s travelads sponsored search product for hotel advertisers hotwire’s airfare savings hub hotelscom’s slider tools for improving search results and the tripadvisor media network’s offering of leading travel applications for download on facebookcom 

 

we intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our travelers suppliers and advertisers including our current efforts to build a scaleable serviceoriented technology platform for our various websites across our portfolio of brands we expect this to result in improved flexibility and faster innovation this transition should allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality improve search engine indexing and add significant personalization features this transition is occurring in a phased approach with a portion of our worldwide points of sale continuing to migrate to the new platform during 2008 

 

for our suppliers we have developed proprietary technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet 

our travelers can now book hotel stays with over 35000 worldwide merchant hotel properties of which over 45 are now fully directconnected we began offering a more streamlined application programming interface for certain of our lodging partners in 2007 to enable faster and simpler integration of realtime hotel content we intend to continue investing in tools to make supplier integration easier seamless and cost effective including efforts in europe to add multilingual interfaces with easier price and inventory upload features 

 

we are also improving our data handling capabilities across expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse which will allow enhanced segmentation and merchandising on our websites and in our email communications with our travelers 

 

global reach we currently operate our points of sale both in the us and internationally our hotelscom and tripadvisor brands also maintain both us websites and international sites outside the united states we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong in 2007 our european segment gross bookings and revenue accounted for approximately 21 of worldwide gross bookings and 23 of worldwide revenue 

 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our existing international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches may occur under our flagship expedia brand through one of our other brands or through acquisition of thirdparty brands as in the case of elong 

 

expedia corporate travel currently operates in the united states belgium canada china france germany italy spain and the united kingdom we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint of our ect business 

 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing website features adding supplier products and services or offering proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

 

expedia’s scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby expedia travelers have created nearly 300000 qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites in addition our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and nontravel advertisers 

 

breadth of product offering we believe we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time 

 

most of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations and the sale of airline tickets either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we are working to grow our package business as it results in higher revenue per transaction and we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we are also working to increase the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites which have historically been focused on transaction revenue such as expediacom and hotelscom 

 

merchant and agency business models 

 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers 

and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

 

as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we negotiate inventory allocation and pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to those provided through the agency model 

 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models we are also expanding our use of thirdparty provided preassembled package offerings particularly through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers 

 

our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets hotel cruise and car rental reservations airline ticket transactions make up the majority of this business although net revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 58 of total gross bookings for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

relationships with travel suppliers distribution and fulfillment partners 

 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines lodging properties car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs our partner services group consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale including participation in our seasonal and eventdriven promotions 

 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet our travelers can now book reservations with over 35000 merchant hotel properties worldwide of which over 45 are now fully directconnected 

 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or “segments” the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products 

 

while we historically used worldspan as our primary gds in light of the deregulated gds environment and our desire to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers we diversified our use of gds providers in 2006 and 2007 by adding distribution agreements with sabre and amadeus who are now our primary segment providers 

fulfillment partners we outsource certain of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to thirdparty suppliers such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services 

 

marketing and promotions 

 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner 

 

our marketing channels primarily include offline advertising online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites as well as through direct email communication with our travelers in addition our expediabranded websites provide content and services to the travel channel on the msncom website in the united states and msn websites in canada france germany italy and the united kingdom our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier relationships in addition we introduced the thankyou rewards network in 2006 and a cobranded credit card with citigroup in 2007 whereby expedia travelers can earn thankyou reward points by purchasing select travel bookings on wwwexpediacom as well as for purchases with their cobranded card 

 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites we have agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an expediabranded website a cobranded website or their own private label website we also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services 

 

operations and technology 

 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we provide this support infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and inhouse call centers which are located in various locations throughout the world including extensive outsourced operations in the philippines and el salvador we plan to make significant investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and beyond 

 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are hosted by thirdparty web hosting suppliers in various locations mainly in the united states which provide communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are also located at these facilities 

 

we have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace for example our best fare search technology essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the us from gds partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to reassemble multileg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler we are looking to expand this technology internationally we are also investing in improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive rates for our travelers 

 

we are investing in and building a scaleable serviceoriented technology platform for our travelers which will extend across our portfolio of brands we plan to significantly invest in this platform in 2008 and beyond we expect this investment to result in longterm cost savings improved flexibility and faster goforward innovation this transition should also allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality improve search engine indexing add significant personalization features and ultimately improve 

our ability to drive higher returnoninvestment in our online and offline advertising efforts we are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation mining and segmentation capabilities across expedia leveraging our enterprise data warehouse 

 

we are continuing to invest in our replatforming and enterprise data warehouse initiatives and we anticipate travelerfacing benefits beginning in late 2008 or early 2009 

 

competition 

 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online particularly in international markets indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad 

 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services and other companies offering travel search engines including metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets in some cases competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult 

 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price or promotional offers traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

 

our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as long standing loyalty programs lower transaction fees and better pricing our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers as opposed to a single supplier and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors supplier consolidation or business models 

 

intellectual property rights 

 

we regard our intellectual property rights including our patents service marks trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success for example we rely heavily upon the software code informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service 

 

we rely on a combination of laws business practices and contractual obligations with employees suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets despite these precautions it may be possible for a thirdparty to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining our current registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses while we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names effective trademark and domain name protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names 

governed by private contract in addition our infringement monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or may be registered by us even if available the failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names andor limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names 

 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

 

regulation 

 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including in some countries laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

 

we generate our revenue through a diverse customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers no customer represented 10 or more of our total revenue in the periods presented in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in the first quarter of 2006 we began reporting two segments north america and europe the change from a single reportable segment is a result of the reorganization of our business we have not reported segment information for the year ended december 31 2005 as it is not practicable to do so the segment and geographic information required herein is contained in note 16 — segment information  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

 

additional information 

 

company website and public filings we maintain a corporate website at wwwexpediainccom except as explicitly noted the information on our website as well as the websites of our various brands and businesses is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k or in any other filings with or in any information furnished or submitted to the sec 

 

we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k filed or furnished pursuant to sections 13a or 

section 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 

 

code of ethics we post our code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all employees including all executive officers senior financial officers and directors on our corporate website at wwwexpediainccom our code of business conduct and ethics complies with item 406 of sec regulation sk and the rules of the nasdaq we intend to disclose any changes to the code that affect the provisions required by item 406 of regulation sk and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive officers senior financial officers or directors on our corporate website 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 7150 fulltime and parttime employees including approximately 1690 employees of elong we believe we have good relationships with our employees including relationships with employees represented by works councils or other similar organizations 

 

tablestart 


 part i item 1a   risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

 

we operate in an increasingly competitive global environment 

 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services with respect to each of the services we offer some of our competitors particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms including lower prices no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as expedia for instance some low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online inventory exclusively through their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee and in some instances offer advantages such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than offerings like ours in addition we face increasing competition from other travel agencies which in some cases may have favorable offerings for both travelers and suppliers including pricing connectivity and supply breadth we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may increase competitive pressures or lead to changes in our business model increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base 

 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers 

 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners adverse changes in existing relationships or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms if at all could reduce the amount quality and breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that we are able to offer which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

 

travel suppliers are increasingly seeking to lower their travel distribution costs by promoting direct online bookings through their own websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to consumers such as “best rate guarantees” loyalty programs andor lower transaction fees in addition travel suppliers may choose not to make their travel products and services available through our distribution channels to the 

extent that consumers continue to increase the percentage of their travel purchases through supplier direct websites andor if travel suppliers choose not to make their products and services available to us our business may suffer 

 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry accordingly if there is a downturn or weakness in the travel industry it could have a material adverse effect on our business travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns including downturns in any of our major markets events or weakness specific to the air travel industry that could negatively affect our business include continued fare increases travelrelated strikes or labor unrest consolidations bankruptcies or liquidations and further fuel price escalation additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus our business has in the past and may in the future decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as avian flu such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and constrained liquidity if we provide relief to affected travelers by not charging cancellation fees andor by refunding the price of airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

 

we rely on the value of our brands and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing 

 

we believe continued investment in our brands including expediacom hotelscom hotwirecom classic vacation expedia corporate travel elong the tripadvisor media network and expedia local expert is critical to retain and expand our traveler supplier and advertiser bases we have and expect to continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value due to a variety of factors these include increased spending from our competitors expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and meta search engines as destination sites for travelers we have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of our brands and we will continue to spend money on and devote resources to advertising and marketing as well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective or as costeffective as they have been historically if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a costeffective manner it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics 

 

we increasingly utilize internet search engines principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of our business is directed to our own websites through our participation in payperclick and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties and search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and competitively if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking paid or unpaid of our websites or that of our thirdparty distribution partners or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected 

we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 

 

we depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems including technology and systems used for reservations communications procurement and administration as our operations grow in both size and scope we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products services features and functionality while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings 

 

in addition we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a costeffective manner we are currently in the process of migrating portions of our site functionality to a new technology platform to enable us to introduce innovation more rapidly achieve better search engine optimization and improve our site merchandising capability among other anticipated benefits we have experienced some delays with this migration delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner to the extent anticipated or at all also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future if any of these events occur our business could suffer 

 

we rely on thirdparties for many systems and services 

 

we rely on thirdparty service providers for certain fulfillment processing development technology and other services if these thirdparties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to provide certain services to our travelers and operate some aspects of our business in addition if such thirdparty service providers were to cease operations temporarily or permanently face financial distress or we were unable to successfully negotiate future contracts with such providers we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we could develop our technology or operations in addition we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of traveler care and information technology services if we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we ineffectively manage these partnerships it could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

 

over the last several years we have experienced downward pressure on remuneration from our suppliers 

 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites over the last several years air and hotel travel suppliers have generally reduced or in some cases eliminated payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries in addition as our hotel remuneration varies with the room rates paid by travelers average daily rates or “adrs” to the extent adrs grow more slowly than anticipated or decline our revenue for each room sold will generally be proportionately lower each year we typically negotiate or renegotiate numerous longterm airline and hotel contracts no assurances can be given that gds partners or travel suppliers will not further reduce of eliminate compensation or attempt to charge travel agencies for content any of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company 

in addition we have experienced a high rate of executive turnover since 2005 our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees many of whom joined expedia recently expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business in addition competition for wellqualified employees in all aspects of our business including software engineers and other technology professionals is intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

 

our stock price is highly volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 

 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence in order to achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets including supplier relationships and traveler preferences learning the customs and cultures of various countries particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth 

 

we expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations these risks include political instability threatened or actual acts of terrorism changes in regulatory requirements our ability to comply with additional us laws applicable to us companies operating internationally as well as local laws and 

regulations diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights possible preferences by local populations for local providers restrictions on the withdrawal of nonus investment and earnings currency exchange restrictions slower adoption of the internet as an advertising broadcast and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the united states and difficulties in managing staffing and operations due to distance time zones language and cultural differences 

 

changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance 

 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce consumer protection and privacy such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet user privacy taxation and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

 

adverse application of tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial performance 

 

the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax laws rules and regulations were amended if new adverse laws rules or regulations were adopted or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes the results could increase our tax payments prospectively or retrospectively andor subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance we continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with and defending our position in the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 

 

system interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

 

we rely on computer systems to facilitate and process transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to thirdparties any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance could impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

 

in addition we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical aspects of our operations or business processes many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs 

of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

 

intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and operate profitably 

 

expedia inc websites including in particular the tripadvisor media network compete for advertising dollars with large internet portal sites such as american online msn and yahoo that offer listing or other advertising opportunities for travelrelated companies these companies have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources and large client bases we also compete with search engines like google and yahoo search that offer payperclick advertising services in addition we compete with newspapers magazines and other traditional media companies that provide offline and online advertising opportunities we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies including print media companies enter the online advertising market competition could results in reduced margins on our advertising services loss of market share or less use of our sites by travel companies and travelers if we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors our business could be materially adversely affected in addition the tripadvisor media network is increasingly reliant on natural and paid search traffic from major search engines whose per unit costs have been increasing 

 

mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty media corporation may effectively control the company 

 

subject to the terms of a stockholders agreement between mr diller and liberty media corporation mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of the board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 60 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2007 

 

in addition under a governance agreement among mr diller liberty media corporation and expedia inc as amended each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 81 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from us mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman and chief executive officer of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that messrs diller and kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both iac and expedia stock could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of messrs diller and kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia both messrs diller and kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between iac and expedia 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between iac and expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

 

we may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable 

 

the availability of funds depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control we can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms to fund investments acquisitions stock repurchases or extraordinary actions in addition any downgrade of our debt ratings by standard  poor’s moody’s investor service or similar ratings agencies increases in general interest rate levels or general weakening in the credit markets could increase our cost of capital 

 

we have foreign exchange risk 

 

as a result of our international websites and acquisitions we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states further due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure we have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling the euro canadian dollar and chinese renminbi foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency results in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations additionally the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency of profitable cash generating foreign operations and we choose not to hedge or fail to hedge effectively our exposure it could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition 

 

our investment in elong creates risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in china 

 

the success of our investment in elong a company organized under cayman law whose principal business is the operation of an internetbased travel business in china is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the interpretation of china’s laws and regulations the chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike common law systems it is a system in which decided legal cases have limited value as precedent the lack of precedent causes the interpretation and enforcement of chinese law to involve uncertainties that could limit the available legal protections in addition we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet foreign investment or licensing including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations or the preemption of local regulations by national laws in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict certain direct foreign investment in the airticketing travel agency internet content provision and advertising businesses such laws and regulations require that we establish effective control through a series of agreements with elong’s affiliated chinese entities and could restrict our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment and in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible to be enforced in china 

our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches 

 

in the processing of our traveler transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel andor online data 

 

we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches a substantial data breach could significantly harm our business damage our reputation expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability andor cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands 

 

these and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties 

 

our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions to the extent that we grow through acquisitions we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy we would also face operational risks such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses disrupting their ongoing businesses increased complexity of our business impairing management resources and their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management further the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business may divert management time and other resources some acquisitions may not be successful and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value 

 

certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are

beginning on september 20 2004 twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against iac and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the federal securities laws these cases arose out of iac’s august 4 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of the company’s stock was artificially inflated by preannouncement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by iac’s travel businesses on december 20 2004 the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits appointed colead plaintiffs and designated colead plaintiffs’ counsel see in re iacinteractivecorp securities litigation no 04cv7447 sdny expedia is not a party to this litigation however under the terms of its separation agreement with iac expedia has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities if any associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the spinoff of the businesses or entities that comprise expedia following the spinoff

trends 

 

the travel industry including offline and online travel agencies as well as suppliers of travel products and services has been characterized by rapid and significant change 

 

the us airline sector in particular has experienced significant turmoil with oil prices hitting alltime highs the shift of capacity to lowcost carriers “lccs” offering “no frills” flights at discounted prices and 

the entry and subsequent emergence of several of the largest traditional carriers from the protection of chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 

 

the traditional carriers’ need to rationalize their high fixed cost structures to better compete in this environment has caused them to curtail their domestic capacities thereby increasing their load factors and enabling them to more easily pass along fare increases competitive pressures have also caused them to consider consolidation opportunities to better share fixed costs and reduce redundant flight routes while these attempts have historically been unsuccessful either due to antitrust concerns or reluctance among target companies to consummate mergers more recent discussions have apparently progressed to very advanced stages for a number of carriers should one or more of these combinations prove successful it could result in further capacity reductions and airfare increases 

 

higher load factors are positive for expedia from a demand standpoint but negative if they lead to reduced availability of merchant air capacity and fare increases fare increases are generally negative for expedia’s business as they may negatively impact traveler demand and our remuneration is tied principally to ticket volumes not ticket prices fare increases were especially pronounced in late 2007 and have continued into early 2008 

 

carriers have aggressively pursued cost reductions in every aspect of their operations including distribution costs airlines have successfully negotiated lower and in some cases eliminated travel agent commissions and overrides and focused on increasing direct distribution through their lower cost proprietary websites in addition in 2006 carriers succeeded in reducing payments to global distribution system “gds” intermediaries as those contracts expired the gdss in turn have passed on these reductions to large travel agents including expedia which historically received a meaningful portion of their air remuneration from gds providers 

 

as a result of these decreased costs of distribution and high load factors expedia’s revenue per air ticket has decreased more than 10 in each of 2005 2006 and 2007 and air revenue now constitutes less than 15 of the company’s overall revenue base however expedia anticipates greater stability in the nonbooking fee portion of its air remuneration beginning in 2008 as it has signed longterm agreements with nine of the top ten domestic carriers and has anniversaried the gds reductions which took place in 2006 

 

in addition to the challenges presented by higher load factors increased fares and lower remuneration per air ticket most larger carriers participating in the expedia marketplace have reduced their share of total air seat capacity at the same time larger lccs such as southwest in the us and ryanair and easyjet in europe have increased their relative capacity but have not generally participated in the expedia marketplace these trends have impacted our ability to obtain supply in our agency and merchant air businesses 

 

the hotel sector has until recently been characterized by robust demand and constrained supply resulting in increasing occupancy rates and average daily rates “adrs” more recently supply has begun to outstrip demand and industry experts anticipate this trend will accelerate in 2008 in addition hotels have begun to see their occupancy rates leveling off and in some cases decreasing with adrs growing at a slower rate or in some markets decreasing while lower occupancies have historically increased expedia’s supply of merchant hotel rooms and a lower rate of adr growth can positively impact underlying demand lower adrs also decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room price 

 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet has driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2007 35 of worldwide leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online with 51 in the united states compared with 32 of european travel and 15 in the asia pacific region these penetration rates have increased considerably over the past few years and are expected to continue growing this significant growth has attracted many competitors to online travel this competition has intensified in recent years and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future 

 

in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services over the last several years with supplier growth outpacing online growth since 2002 and now accounting for more than 60 of all online travel expenditures in the united states according to phocuswright 

differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price it has also led to the development of alternative business models and methods of payment for travelers and suppliers overall competition has led to aggressive marketing spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries and a meaningful reduction in expedia’s overall marketing efficiencies 

 

strategy 

 

expedia plays a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure or business by seeking to build the world’s largest and most intelligent travel marketplace we accomplish this by securing superior supply quality and price competitiveness matching supply and demand as intelligently as possible inspiring and empowering our travelers to find and build the right trip expanding our global demand footprint aggressively and achieving excellence in our people technology and processes to make quality consistency and efficiency the foundation of our marketplace 

 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to complex bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium content about lodging properties and generally appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations 

 

technology and continuous innovation expedia has an established tradition of innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as expediacom’s travelads sponsored search product for hotel advertisers hotwires’s airfare savings hub hotelscom’s slider tools for improving search results and the tripadvisor media network’s offering of leading travel applications for download on facebookcom 

 

we intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our travelers and suppliers including our current efforts to build a scaleable serviceoriented technology platform for our travelers which will extend across our portfolio of brands we expect this to result in improved flexibility and allow faster innovation this transition should allow us to improve site merchandising browse and search functionalities improve search index optimization and add significant personalization features this transition is occurring in a phased approach with a portion of our worldwide points of sale continuing to migrate to the new platform in 2008 

 

for our suppliers we have developed proprietary technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands we began offering more streamlined application programming interfaces for certain of our lodging partners in 2007 to enable faster and simpler integration of realtime hotel content and intend to continue investing in tools to make supplier integration easier more seamless and cost effective 

 

global reach we currently operate our points of sale in both the us and internationally including expediabranded sites in the united states australia austria canada denmark france germany ireland italy japan the netherlands new zealand norway spain sweden and the united kingdom our hotelscom and tripadvisor brands also maintain both us points of sale and additional points of sale outside the united states we also offer chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong in 2007 our european segment gross bookings and revenue accounted for approximately 21 of worldwide gross bookings and 23 of worldwide revenue 

 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our existing international points of sale we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce such as india 

ect currently supports operations in the united states belgium canada china france germany italy spain and the united kingdom we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint of our ect business 

 

in expanding our global reach we leverage significant investments in technology operations brand building supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries introducing website features adding supplier products and services or offering proprietary and usergenerated content for travelers 

 

breadth of product  content offerings we believe we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products services and content resources to travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time 

 

most of our revenue comes from transactions involving the booking of hotel reservations and the sale of airline tickets either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we are working to grow our package business as it results in higher revenue per transaction and we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings we are also working to increase the mix of advertising and media revenue from both the expansion of our tripadvisor media network as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites which have historically been focused on transaction revenue such as expediacom and hotelscom 

 

seasonality 

 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer as a result revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

 35 

 

for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

 

marketing promotions 

 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services which include inducement offers inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates we allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used 

 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

 

goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business working capital effects and effective income tax rate the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly traded our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because 

 

 36 

 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment an impairment loss would only be recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated fair value determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows our impairment analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable this analysis requires us to estimate current and future cash flows attributable to the group of assets the time period for which they will be held and used as well as a discount rate to incorporate the time value of money and the risks inherent in future cash flows 

 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

 

income taxes 

 

in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

 

we record liabilities to address uncertain tax positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return the determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position taking into consideration whether it is more likely than not that our tax position based on technical merits will be sustained upon examination for those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority the difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  in the first quarter of 2007 

other longterm liabilities 

 

various legal and tax contingencies we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

 

occupancy tax some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax or a form of sales tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time 

 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce it is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised in 2005 we recognized significant changes in estimates related to our forfeiture rate see note 9 — stockbased awards and other equity instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

segments 

 

we have two reportable segments north america and europe we determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance 

 

our north america segment provides a full range of travel andor advertising services to customers primarily located in the united states canada and mexico this segment operates through a variety of brands including expediacom hotelscom hotwirecom and tripadvisor 

 

our europe segment provides travel services primarily through localized expedia websites in austria denmark france germany ireland italy the netherlands norway spain sweden and the united kingdom as well as localized versions of hotelscom in various european countries 

 

corporate and other includes ect expedia asia pacific and unallocated corporate functions and expenses ect provides travel products and services to corporate customers in north america and europe expedia asia pacific provides online travel information and reservation services primarily through elong in china localized expedia websites in australia japan and new zealand as well as localized versions of hotelscom in various asian countries 

 

operating metrics 

 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics that represent the selling activities generated by our travel products and services as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book their travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally reduced for cancellations and refunds 

 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 

 

gross bookings increased 28 billion or 16 in 2007 compared to 2006 and 16 billion or 10 in 2006 compared to 2005 in 2007 north america gross bookings increased 9 and europe gross bookings increased 41 compared to 2006 in 2006 domestic gross bookings increased 6 and international gross bookings increased 26 compared to 2005 the increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and travel product prices 

revenue margin which is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings increased 30 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 in 2007 revenue margin increased 53 basis points in our north america segment the increase in worldwide and north america revenue margin in 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue partially offset by a decline in revenue per air ticket revenue margin decreased 69 basis points in our europe segment in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to lower air commissions and booking fees as well as lower revenue resulting from more competitive hotel pricing revenue margin decreased 59 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in air revenue per ticket coupled with an increase in average worldwide airfares of 9 for 2006 compared to 2005 as our remuneration generally does not vary with the price of the ticket 

 

results of operations 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

in 2007 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide merchant hotel revenue and to a lesser extent advertising and media revenue 

 

worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 19 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase was primarily due to a 12 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages as well as a 6 increase in revenue per room night revenue per room night increased due to a 6 increase in worldwide adrs partially offset by a 13 basis point decline in hotel raw margin defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross revenue 

 

worldwide air revenue decreased 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 12 decrease in revenue per air ticket partially offset by an increase of 12 in air tickets sold the decrease in revenue per air ticket primarily reflects decreased compensation from air carriers and gds providers and to a lesser extent reduced air service fees versus the prior year period 

 

package revenue grew 7 in 2007 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher european package bookings 

 

the remaining worldwide revenue other than merchant hotel and air discussed above which includes advertising and media agency hotel car rental destination services and cruises increased by 38 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in advertising and media revenue as well as car rental revenues 

 

in 2006 the increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue partially offset by a decline in our domestic air revenue in 2006 domestic revenue growth remained flat and international revenue increased by 24 compared to 2005 

 

worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 13 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 10 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages as well as a 2 increase in revenue per room night revenue per room night increased due to a 6 increase in worldwide adrs partially offset by a 100 basis point decrease in hotel raw margins defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross revenue our merchant hotel raw margins decreased in 2006 and 2005 as hotel room suppliers have taken advantage of higher occupancies and the efficacy of their own online distribution to negotiate more favorable terms 

worldwide air revenue decreased 14 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 13 decrease in revenue per air ticket and a 2 decrease in air tickets sold the decrease in revenue per air ticket reflects decreased compensation from air carriers and gds providers the decrease in air tickets sold reflects the reduction in relative capacity of carriers participating in our marketplace and continued challenges in obtaining merchant air inventory in light of record industry load factors lesser availability of merchant air inventory also impacted our packages revenue which grew only 1 in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

other revenue which includes advertising and media agency hotel car rental destination services and cruises increased by 7 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in advertising and media revenue 

 

cost of revenue and gross profit 

 

 

 

cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 costs of our data and call centers including telesales 2 credit card merchant fees 3 fees paid to fulfillment vendors for processing airline tickets and related customer services 4 costs paid to suppliers for certain destination inventory 5 reserves and related payments to airlines for tickets purchased with fraudulent credit cards and 6 stockbased compensation 

 

the cost of revenue increase in 2007 compared to 2006 and in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher costs associated with the increase in transaction volumes 

 

the yearoveryear increases in gross profit are primarily due to increased revenue and to a lesser extent an increase in gross margin gross margin increased 136 basis points in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased mix of advertising and media revenue as well as cost savings from our various efficiency initiatives gross margin increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the increased mix of merchant hotel revenue 

 

selling and marketing 

 

 

 

selling and marketing expense relates to direct advertising expense including television radio and print spending as well as traffic generation from internet portals search engines and our private label and affiliate programs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including stockbased compensation costs and market manager staffing in our partner services group “psg” expedia corporate travel expedia local expert and tripadvisor media network 

 

in 2007 the increase in selling and marketing was primarily due to increased direct online search and brand spend across our worldwide points of sale as well as higher personnel costs 

 

in 2006 the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to growth in indirect psg and destination services staffing costs direct selling and marketing expense grew 7 in 2006 

 

we expect selling and marketing expense to be higher as a percentage of revenue in 2008 as we continue to support our established brands and geographies grow our earlier stage international markets increase our use of brand spend as markets reach scale anticipate continued keyword inflation invest in our global 

advertising and media businesses and expand our corporate travel sales destination services and market management teams 

 

general and administrative 

 

 

 

general and administrative expense consists primarily of 1 personnelrelated costs for support functions that include our executive leadership finance legal tax technology and human resource functions 2 stockbased compensation costs and 3 fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting 

 

in 2007 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to expansion of our corporate information technology functions our european businesses and tripadvisor media network as well as higher incentive compensation expense higher legal expenses and higher payroll taxes related to stock option exercises we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue in 2008 to remain relatively similar to 2007 

 

in 2006 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in our headcount and accompanying compensation resulting from our being a standalone public company for the full year as well as increased legal expenses partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to stock options that completed their vesting cycles 

 

technology and content 

 

 

 

technology and content expense consists of expenses for customizing our websites amortization of website and internal software development costs localization of our websites and product development expenses such as personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation 

 

the yearoveryear expense increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to growth in personnelrelated expenses in our software development and engineering teams as we continued to increase our level of website innovation the increase in 2007 was also due to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs a significant amount of which relates to projects that were placed into service beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 for additional information about our policy related to capitalized software costs see note 2 — significant accounting policies 

 

given our historical and ongoing investments in our enterprise data warehouse new platform geographic expansion data centers redundancy call center technology site merchandising content management site monitoring networking corporate travel supplier integration and other initiatives we expect technology and content expense to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 

in 2007 and 2006 amortization of intangible assets expense decreased compared to 2006 and 2005 primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology and supplier intangible assets partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions 

 

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 — acquisitions and other investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of intangible asset 

 

in 2006 we recognized an impairment charge of 470 million in relation to hotwire’s indefinitelived trade name intangible asset there was no such charge in 2007 or 2005 

 

amortization of noncash distribution and marketing 

 

 

 

amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense consists mainly of advertising from universal television contributed to us by iac at spinoff with an original value of 171 million we used this advertising without any cash cost and during 2006 had fully utilized all media time 

 

operating income 

 

 

 

in 2007 the increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit the impairment charge of 470 million in 2006 and a decrease in amortization of intangibles and amortization of noncash distribution and marketing partially offset by growth in sales and marketing expense and technology and content expense 

 

in 2006 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the impairment charge of 470 million and higher selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses these increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit lower amortization expense related to intangible assets and lower stockbased compensation 

 

in 2005 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 917 million primarily related to stock options and rsus our 2005 stockbased compensation expense includes a benefit of 447 million related to changes in estimated forfeiture rates for stock options and rsus and capitalization of software development costs partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards related to the spinoff in 2005 we completed assessments of the estimated forfeiture rates including analyses of the actual number of instruments that had forfeited to date compared to prior estimates and an evaluation of future estimated forfeitures for additional information see note 9 — stockbased awards and other equity instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating income before amortization “oiba” 

 

 

 

in 2007 the increase in oiba was primarily due to an increase in gross profit partially offset by growth in sales and marketing expenses and technology and content expenses oiba as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to growth in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue partially offset by an increase in gross margin 

 

in 2006 the decrease in oiba was primarily due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher revenue and the improvement in gross margin 

 

definition of oiba 

 

we provide oiba as a supplemental measure to gaap we define oiba as operating income plus 1 amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense 2 stockbased compensation expense 3 amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment if applicable and 4 certain onetime items if applicable 

 

oiba is the primary operating metric used by which management evaluates the performance of our business on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the comparable gaap measures gaap financial statements and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure we present a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to gaap below 

 

oiba represents the combined operating results of expedia inc’s businesses taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of other noncash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations we believe this measure is useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

oiba has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of income including stockbased compensation noncash payments to partners acquisitionrelated accounting and certain onetime items if applicable due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income such as tax rates stock price and interest rates we are unable to provide a reconciliation to net income on a forwardlooking basis without unreasonable efforts 

reconciliation of oiba to operating income and net income 

 

the following table presents a reconciliation of oiba to operating income and net income for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

prior to the spinoff the intercompany receivable balances were subject to a cash management arrangement with iac since we extinguished our intercompany receivable balances with iac at spinoff with a noncash distribution to iac we no longer receive interest income from iac 

 

the yearoveryear increases in other interest income were primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances 

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

interest expense increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average debt balances resulting from the 5000 million senior unsecured notes the “notes” issuance in august 2006 and a 5000 million draw on our revolving credit facility in august 2007 to fund a portion of the tender offer completed in the third quarter of 2007 at december 31 2007 and 2006 our longterm indebtedness totaled 1085 billion and 5000 million 

 

in 2006 interest expense increased compared to 2005 due to interest expense related to the notes 

writeoff of longterm investment 

 

in 2005 we received information regarding the deteriorating financial condition of our longterm investment in a leisure travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would recover any of our investment because the decline in its value was determined to be otherthantemporary as a result we recorded a loss related to this impairment of 234 million in 2006 we sold our investment for de minimis consideration 

 

other net 

 

 

 

in 2007 other net primarily includes net foreign exchange rate losses of 220 million resulting principally from the fluctuation of exchange rates on foreign denominated assets and liabilities of us dollar functional currency subsidiaries net losses of 57 million from fair value changes in and the settlement of derivative instruments related to the ask jeeves notes and certain stock warrants as well as 26 million of losses from unconsolidated equity affiliates partially offset by a gain of 121 million relating to federal excise tax refunds 

 

in 2006 other net primarily includes net foreign exchange rate gains of 104 million resulting principally from the fluctuation of exchange rates on foreign denominated assets and liabilities of us dollar functional subsidiaries as well as net gains of 81 million from the fair value changes in and the settlement of derivative instruments related to the ask jeeves notes and certain stock warrants 

 

in 2005 other net primarily includes an unrealized loss of 60 million in the fair value changes in derivative instruments related to the ask jeeves notes and certain stock warrants 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

in 2007 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes taxes related to our foreign operations and nondeductible losses related to our derivative liabilities the 2007 effective rate increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher state taxes including increases to state tax rates and nondeductible losses related to our derivative liabilities compared with a gain in 2006 

 

in 2006 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and valuation allowance on certain foreign losses partially offset by nontaxable gains related to our derivative liabilities the 2006 effective rate decreased as compared to 2005 due to higher nondeductible stockbased compensation nondeductible losses related to our derivative liabilities in 2005 compared with a gain in 2006 and higher state income taxes in 2005 

 

in 2005 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign operating losses in addition our effective tax rate was affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation expense unrealized losses related to our derivative liabilities and a loss from the writeoff of our longterm investment 

 

segment operating results 

 

in the first quarter of 2006 we began reporting two segments north america and europe the change from a single reportable segment was a result of the reorganization of our business we determined our 

segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance our primary operating metric for evaluating segment performance is oiba defined above we have not reported segment information for the year ended december 31 2005 as it is not practicable to do so for additional information about our segment results see note 16 — segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents balances which were 6174 million and 8533 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 which included 1582 million and 1533 million of cash at elong whose results are consolidated into our financial statements due to our controlling voting and economic ownership position and our 10 billion revolving credit facility of which 3627 million was available as of december 31 2007 this represents the total 10 billion facility less 5850 million of outstanding borrowings and 523 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” outstanding credit facility borrowings bear interest based on our financial leverage based on our december 31 2007 financial statements the interest rate would equate to a base rate plus 75 basis points we may choose 1 the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or 2 various durations of libor as our base rate as of february 15 2008 the base rate was onemonth libor of 3125 and is due to reprice on march 17 2008 as of february 15 2008 850 million of the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2007 under the credit facility had been repaid 

 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our suppliers related to these bookings generally within two weeks after completing the transaction for air travel and for all other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the supplier therefore generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business continues to grow and our business model does not significantly change we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows if this business declines relative to our other businesses or if there are changes to the model or booking patterns which compress the time between receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers our working capital benefits could be reduced as was the case to a certain degree in 2006 as we increased the efficiency of our supplier payment process 

 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above may affect working capital which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had a deficit in our working capital of 7287 million compared to a deficit of 2248 million as of december 31 2006 the increase in deficit is primarily a result of the completion of two tender offers during 2007 partially offset by the generation of working capital from operations 

 

we anticipate continued investment in the development and expansion of our operations these investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our enterprise data warehouse servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code and continuing efforts to build a scaleable serviceoriented technology platform that will extend across our portfolio of brands we migrated a portion of expediacom to the new platform during 2007 and we expect additional points of sale to migrate to the new platform during 2008 we will also relocate many of our global offices including our corporate headquarters to larger facilities in 2008 to accomodate the growth of our business these moves will result in significant investments to improve the new facilities total capital expenditures are expected to be 140 million to 150 million our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions or expenditures in support of our business strategy in the event we have 

acquisitions this may reduce our cash balance andor increase our debt legal risks and challenges to our business strategy may also negatively affect our cash balance 

 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 

 

in 2007 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 946 million primarily due to an increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in cash flows from operating income partially offset by an increase in interest payments in the current period in 2006 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2417 million primarily due to an increase in tax payments and a decrease in cash flows from operating income as well as a reduced benefit from working capital we made tax payments of 1261 million an increase of 1157 million over 2005 reducing cash provided by operations due primarily to iac’s payment of taxes on behalf of expedia prior to our becoming an independent public company after which point we became responsible for our tax obligations 

 

in 2007 cash used in investing activities increased by 660 million primarily due to a 271 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions and a 317 million increase in longterm investments and deposits mainly related to our 50 investment in a travel company these increases were offset by a decrease of 60 million in capital expenditures excluded from 2007 capital expenditures is approximately 131 million in capital equipment that we received but for which we had not yet paid as of december 31 2007 cash used in investing activities decreased by 6878 million in 2006 primarily due to the absence of transfers to iac of 7572 million partially offset by net cash paid for acquisitions of 325 million and a 403 million increase in capital expenditures in part due to capitalized software costs incurred for the development of our enterprise data warehouse and other improvements to our technology infrastructure 

 

cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily included cash paid to acquire shares in the first and third quarter tender offers pursuant to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 2200 per share and 25 million tendered shares of our common stock at 2900 per share for a total cost of 1385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers in addition we paid withholding taxes for stock option exercises of 1212 million on behalf of our chairman and senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled these were offset in part by 5850 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility used primarily to fund a portion of the third quarter tender offer 550 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and 957 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards of which approximately 923 million related to the excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our chairman and senior executive 

 

cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was primarily due to the net proceeds of 4953 million from the notes issuance in 2006 and 353 million in proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by 2957 million of treasury stock activity primarily related to cash paid to acquire shares in the second and third quarters pursuant to which we acquired in open market trades 20 million shares of our common stock at an average per share price of 1442 for a total cost of 2880 million and the 2300 million repayment of our revolving credit facility which was initially borrowed in 2005 

 

cash provided by financing activities in 2005 was primarily due to net credit facility borrowings of 2300 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 291 million partially offset by withholding taxes for stock option exercises of 866 million that we paid on behalf of our chairman and 

senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares to treasury or to be cancelled and distributions to iac of 528 million 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 we issued 5000 million notes for net proceeds of 4953 million the notes are due august 2018 and bear a fixed interest rate of 7456 with interest payable semiannually in february and august of each year which began in february 2007 the notes are repayable in whole or in part on august 15 2013 at the option of the note holders and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at our option as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all related covenants 

 

the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2007 showed a net decrease of 206 million our foreign currency cash balances continued to benefit from foreign currency appreciation but to a lesser extent than 2006 due to a different mix of currencies held and relatively less appreciation in certain of the primary foreign currencies in which we transact the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2006 showed a net increase of 507 million from 2005 due to the benefit of foreign currency appreciation during that time period versus our reporting currency as well as the increase in our foreign denominated cash balances 

 

we currently have authorization for which there is no fixed termination date from our board of directors to repurchase up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock no such repurchases have been made under this authorization 

 

we also have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec under which expedia inc may offer from time to time debt securities guarantees of debt securities preferred stock common stock or warrants the shelf registration statement expires on october 15 2010 

 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

our contractual obligations and commercial commitments are as follows

 part ii item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk management 

 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our notes our revolving credit facility derivative instruments cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable intercompany receivables merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in august 2006 we issued 5000 million notes with a fixed rate of 7456 as a result if market interest rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair value of our notes was approximately 517 million as of december 31 2007 based on the quoted market price a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes by approximately 19 million 

 

in july 2005 we entered into a 10 billion revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility bears interest based on market interest rates plus a spread which is determined based on our financial leverage the weighted average interest rate was 570 as of december 31 2007 as a result we will be susceptible to 

fluctuations in interest rates if consistent with our practice to date we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2007 our outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility was 5850 million no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2006 a hypothetical 10 increase in market rates would increase our interest expense by 33 million 

 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2007 or 2006 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of income to the extent practicable we minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies 

 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period and our ability to maintain natural hedges against such exposures as an example if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10 against the us dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10 against the us dollar we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately 63 million based on the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable deferred merchant bookings and merchant payable balances as of december 31 2007 as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently even daily as do foreign exchange rates the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period 

 

during 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of 220 million net foreign exchange rate gains of 104 million and net foreign exchange rate losses of 06 million as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 

 

as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically we have not hedged foreign exchange risks we periodically review our strategy for hedging foreign exchange risks our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

 

we use crosscurrency swaps to hedge against the change in value of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency for additional information about our crosscurrency swaps see note 7 — derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

equity price risk 

 

we do not maintain any minority investments in equity securities as part of our marketable securities investment strategy thus our equity price risk primarily relates to fluctuations in our stock price which affects our derivative liabilities related to outstanding ask jeeves notes we base the fair value of these derivative instruments primarily on the changes in the market price of our common stock 

in 2007 certain of these notes were converted at fair value for 66 million of common stock or 03 million shares as additional notes are converted the value of the derivative liability will be reduced and our equity price risk will decrease accordingly the conversion of the ask jeeves notes during 2007 reduced our obligation to issue our common stock from 08 million shares as of december 31 2006 to 05 million shares as of december 31 2007 

 

as of december 31 2007 each 100 fluctuation in our common stock will result in approximately 05 million of change in the aggregate fair value of our ask jeeves notes derivative liability an increase in our common stock price will result in a charge to our consolidated statements of income and a decrease in our common stock price will result in a credit the ask jeeves notes are due june 1 2008 upon maturity of these notes our obligation to satisfy demands for conversion ceases

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the board of directors and stockholders expedia inc 

 

we have audited expedia inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria expedia inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion expedia inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the 2007 consolidated financial statements of expedia inc and our report dated february 20 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

business strategy 

 

expedia inc is building the world’s largest and most intelligent travel marketplace we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure or business we are committed to providing our travelers with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by taking advantage of our critical assets — our brand portfolio our technologies and continuous innovation our global reach and our breadth of product offering in doing so we take advantage of our growing base of knowledge about our destinations suppliers and travelers based on our unique position in the travel value chain 

 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering and facilitation of single item bookings of discounted product to complex bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium content about lodging properties and generally appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations 

 

we believe our appeal to suppliers is enhanced by our brand portfolio and our international points of sale by allowing suppliers to access the broadest possible range of travelers with their product and service offerings we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio for the benefit of travelers and suppliers 

 

technologies and continuous innovation expedia has an established tradition of innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as our thankyou rewards network offered in conjunction with citigroup expedia ® fare alerts travel ticker tm by hotwire ®  tripadvisor’s wikis and ect’s business intelligence toolset 

 

we intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our travelers including our current efforts in building a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform which will extend across our portfolio of brands we expect this to result in improved flexibility and faster goforward innovation this transition should allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality and add significant personalization features we expect this transition to occur in a phased approach with portions of our worldwide points of sale migrating to the new platform beginning in 2007 

 

we also intend to continue innovating on behalf of our suppliers as an example we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet our travelers can book reservations with over 30000 worldwide merchant hotel properties of which over 35 are now fully directconnected we are planning to offer more streamlined application programming interfaces for our lodging partners in 2007 to enable faster and simpler integration of realtime hotel content 

 

we are also improving our data handling capabilities across expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse which will allow enhanced personalization on both our websites and email communications with our travelers the project is scheduled to begin yielding benefits to our travelers beginning in 2007 

 

global reach in 2006 our international gross bookings accounted for approximately 26 of worldwide gross bookings and 28 of revenue we currently operate over 50 branded points of sale across the globe including expediabranded sites in the united states australia canada denmark france germany italy japan the netherlands norway sweden and the united kingdom our hotelscom and tripadvisor brands 

also maintain both us points of sale and additional points of sale outside the united states lastly we offer chinese travelers a wide array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong 

 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our existing international points of sale including the expected launch of an expediabranded site in india in 2007 we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce future launches such as india may occur under our flagship expedia brand through one of our other brands or through acquisition of thirdparty brands as in the case of elong 

 

ect currently conducts operations in the united states belgium canada france germany and the united kingdom we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to small and mediumsized businesses seeking to control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we also believe that expanding our corporate travel business also increases our appeal to travel product and service suppliers as the average corporate traveler has a higher incidence of first class and international travel than the average leisure traveler we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint of our ect business 

 

in expanding our global reach we are leveraging our significant investment in technology operations brand building supplier integration and relationships and other areas since the launch of expediacom in 1996 

 

we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching new countries introducing website features adding supplier products and services or adding valueadded content for travelers as a result we have been able to launch several websites — including expediabranded sites in japan denmark norway and sweden — relatively quickly and cost effectively 

 

our scale of operations also enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby expedia travelers have created over 300000 qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites 

 

breadth of product offering in general through our websites we believe we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time 

 

the majority of our revenue comes from transactions involving the sale of airline tickets and the booking of hotel reservations either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we are working to grow our package business as it results in higher revenue per transaction and we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings as well as by increasing the mix of revenue from advertising we derive from our travel partners and suppliers 

 

merchant and agency business models 

 

we make travel products and services available both on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

 

as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we negotiate inventory allocation and pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to those provided through the agency model 

 

through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component 

and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models we are also expanding our use of thirdparty provided preassembled package offerings particularly through our international points of sale further broadening our scope of products and services to travelers 

 

our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets hotel cruise and car rental reservations airline ticket transactions make up the majority of this business although net revenue per transaction is lower as compared to the merchant model due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 59 of total gross bookings for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

relationships with travel suppliers distribution and fulfillment partners 

 

overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines lodging properties car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

 

travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs our partner services group consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale 

 

in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet our travelers can book reservations with over 30000 merchant hotel properties worldwide of which over 35 are now fully directconnected 

 

distribution partners gdss also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointtopoint flights or “segments” the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers and online and offline travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products 

 

while we have historically used worldspan as our primary gds in light of the deregulated gds environment and our desire to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers in 2006 we diversified our use of gds providers through distribution agreements and now use worldspan amadeus and sabre 

 

fulfillment partners we outsource certain of our airline ticket fulfillment functions to thirdparty suppliers such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services 

 

marketing and promotions 

 

our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses lower ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success depends on our continued ability to increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner 

 

our marketing channels primarily include direct andor personalized traveler communications on our websites and through email communications search engine marketing and optimization as well as online and 

offline advertising in addition our expediabranded websites provide content and services to the travel channel on the msncom website in the united states and msn websites in canada france germany italy and the united kingdom our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons and gift cards in addition we introduced the thankyou rewards network during the fourth quarter of 2006 whereby travelers earn points for their travel bookings 

 

we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites we have agreements with thousands of thirdparty affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an expediabranded website a cobranded website or their own private label website we also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services 

 

operations and technology 

 

we provide 24houraday sevendayaweek traveler support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we provide this support infrastructure with a combination of inhouse and outsourced call centers which are located in various locations throughout the world 

 

our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are hosted by thirdparty web hosting suppliers in various locations mainly in the united states which provide communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our computer hardware for operating the websites are also located at these facilities 

 

we have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace for example our expert searching and pricing platform “esp platform” which our expediabranded websites use includes two components 1 a faresearching engine that enables broad and deep airline fare and schedule searches and 2 a common database platform that allows our expediabranded websites and our travelers to bundle diverse types of travel services together dynamically which further enables our expediabranded websites to crossmarket and package travel inventory the esp platform has been historically an important contributor to our growth in the online travel industry 

 

another core piece of our technology suite is our best fare search technology this technology essentially deconstructs the segment feeds from gds partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to reassemble multileg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler 

 

we are investing in and building a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform which will extend across our portfolio of brands we plan to significantly invest in this platform in 2007 and 2008 we expect this investment to result in longterm cost savings improved flexibility and faster goforward innovation this transition should also allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality add significant personalization features and ultimately improve our ability to drive higher returnoninvestment in our online and offline advertising we expect this transition to occur in a phased approach with portions of our worldwide points of sale migrating to the new platform beginning in 2007 

 

we are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation and mining capabilities across expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse which is scheduled to begin yielding travelerfacing benefits in 2007 

 

competition 

 

our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online in the global travel industry indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad 

 

our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services and other companies offering travel search engines including metasearch engines we face these competitors in local regional national andor international markets 

 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

 

our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as loyalty programs or lower transaction fees our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers as opposed to a single supplier and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors 

 

intellectual property rights 

 

we regard our intellectual property rights including our patents service marks trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success for example we rely heavily upon the software code informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service 

 

we rely on a combination of laws business practices and contractual obligations with employees suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets despite these precautions it may be possible for a thirdparty to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

 

we maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark applications with the appropriate international trademark offices maintaining our current registrations securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate we also register domain names as we deem appropriate we protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses while we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names effective trademark and domain name protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract in addition our infringement monitoring resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or may be registered by us even if available the failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names andor limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names 

 

we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

 

from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of thirdparties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our 

intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

 

regulation 

 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

 

as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including in some countries laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the european economic community council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure 

 

financial information about segments and geographic areas 

 

we generate our revenue through a diverse customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers no customer represented 10 or more of our total revenue in the periods presented in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in the first quarter of 2006 we began reporting two segments north america and europe the change from a single reportable segment is a result of the reorganization of our business we have not reported segment information for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 as it is not practicable to do so beginning in the first quarter of 2007 we will disclose comparable financial information the segment and geographic information required herein is contained in note 16 — segment information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  

 

additional information 

 

company website and public filings we maintain a corporate website at wwwexpediainccom except as explicitly noted the information on our website as well as the websites of our various brands and businesses is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k or in any other filings with or in any information furnished or submitted to the sec 

 

we make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k filed or furnished pursuant to sections 13a or section 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 

 

code of ethics we post our code of business conduct and ethics which applies to all employees including all executive officers senior financial officers and directors on our corporate website at wwwexpediainccom our code of business conduct and ethics complies with item 406 of sec regulation sk and the rules of the nasdaq we intend to disclose any changes to the code that affect the provisions required by item 406 of regulation sk and any waivers of the code of ethics for our executive officers senior financial officers or directors on our corporate website 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 6600 fulltime and parttime employees including approximately 1650 employees of elong we believe we have good relationships with our 

employees including relationships with employees represented by works councils or other similar organizations 

 




 part i item 1a risk factors 

 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

 

we operate in an increasingly competitive environment 

 

the market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services with respect to each of the services we offer some of our competitors particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer products and services on more favorable terms such as no fees and with unique access to proprietary loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors like us for instance many low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their online inventory exclusively through their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee and in some instances offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than offerings like ours the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch and other search engine technologies may increase competitive pressures increased competition may result in reduced margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base this competition may result in reduced margins loss of segment share and damage to our brand 

 

over the last several years we have experienced downward pressure on commissions and payments to us from our suppliers 

 

a portion of our revenue is derived from compensation paid by travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites we generally negotiate these commissions and fees with our travel suppliers and gds partners over the last several years travel suppliers have generally reduced or eliminated commissions and payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries in particular in 2006 gds partners faced the renegotiation of longterm contracts with airlines on terms that generally resulted in decreased compensation to them we also renegotiated several longterm contracts with airlines and gdss with reduced economic benefits we are currently negotiating and expect to renegotiate other longterm airline and hotel contracts in 2007 no assurances can be given that gds partners or travel suppliers will not further reduce current industry compensation or our compensation either of which could reduce our revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business and financial performance 

 

declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business or financial performance 

 

our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry accordingly downturns or weaknesses in the travel industry could adversely affect our business travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns events or weakness in the travel industry that could negatively affect our business include price escalation in the airline industry or other travelrelated industries airline or other travelrelated strikes airline bankruptcies liquidations or consolidations and fuel price escalation additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus our business may decline after incidents of actual or threatened terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of inclement weather such as hurricanes or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as avian flu such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in 

demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business and financial performance over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as actual or threatened terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs if we provide relief to affected travelers by not charging cancellation fees andor by refunding the price of airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

 

our business depends on our relationships with travel suppliers 

 

an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain our existing relationships and to build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners adverse changes in existing relationships or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms if at all could reduce the amount quality and breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that we are able to offer which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

 

travel suppliers are increasingly seeking to lower their travel distribution costs by promoting direct online bookings through their own websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to consumers such as loyalty programs andor lower transaction fees in addition travel suppliers may choose not to make their travel products and services available through our distribution channels to the extent that consumers continue to increase the percentage of their travel purchases through supplier direct websites andor if travel suppliers choose not to make their products and services available to us our business may suffer 

 

we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

 

our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company 

 

in addition we have experienced a high rate of executive turnover during the last two years our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees many of whom joined expedia recently expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business in addition competition for wellqualified employees in all aspects of our business including software engineers and other technology professionals is intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 

 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses 

 

we rely on our own and thirdparty computer systems and service providers to facilitate and process a portion of our transactions we have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to thirdparties any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or thirdparty providers’ systems or deterioration in their performance could impair each company’s ability to process transactions for its travelers and decrease the quality of service that we can offer to our travelers if we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brands could be harmed 

 

in addition we do not have backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient fire flood power 

loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer or communications systems at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs moreover the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain 

 

our expansion places a significant strain on our management technical operational and financial resources 

 

we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations both domestically and internationally and anticipate expanding further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings and customer base such expansion increases the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our management operations technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion effectively our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth negatively affect our financial performance and hurt our business 

 

acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties 

 

our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions to the extent that we grow through acquisitions we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy we would also face operational risks such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses disrupting their ongoing businesses impairing management resources and their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management further the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business may divert management time and other resources some acquisitions may not be successful and their performances may result in the impairment of their carrying value 

 

certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are 

 

 13 

 

our stock price is highly volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances due to our tax sharing arrangements 

 

our ability to engage in significant stock transactions could be limited or restricted to preserve the tax free nature of our spinoff from iac current federal income tax law creates a presumption that the spinoff would be taxable to iac but not to its stockholders if either iac or we enter into a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or value in iac’s or our stock ownership during the fouryear period that begins two years before the date of the spinoff unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions related to the spinoff treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a spinoff are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances including but not limited to specific factors described in the regulations in addition the regulations provide several “safe harbors” for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan these restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions which might be advantageous to our stockholders such as selling the company or substantially all of the assets of the company issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs or acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities 

 

under the tax sharing agreement with iac there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the spinoff to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction including redeeming substantial amounts of our equity securities and selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets in each case for a period of 25 months following the spinoff which period ends in september 2007 we would be required to indemnify iac against the taxes described in the preceding sentence if such tax is incurred by a breach of our covenants under the tax sharing agreement 

mr diller currently controls expedia and if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty media corporation may effectively control the company 

 

subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of the board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty may effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controlled approximately 55 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock as of december 31 2006 and approximately 58 as of january 19 2007 following our repurchase of 30 million shares of our common stock 

 

in addition under the governance agreement each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 41 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

 

as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from us mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us 

 

actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

 

mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman and chief executive officer of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that messrs diller and kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both iac and expedia stock could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of messrs diller and kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both iac and expedia both messrs diller and kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between iac and expedia 

 

our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between iac and expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

 

changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance 

 

our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce consumer protection and privacy could decrease demand for products and services increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted 

over the internet user privacy taxation and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

 

adverse application of tax laws rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses and financial performance 

 

in addition the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce if the tax laws rules and regulations were amended or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes the results could decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer increase our tax payments andor subject us to penalties as a result these changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance we continue to work with relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing new and emerging laws and regulations there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 

 

our international operations involve risks relating to differing customs and cultures as well as commercial and regulatory environments 

 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states and intend to continue to expand our international presence in order to achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter we must continue to tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of such countries and markets learning the customs and cultures of various countries particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to learn such customs and cultures successfully could slow our international growth 

 

we expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations these risks include political instability threatened or actual acts of terrorism unexpected changes in regulatory requirements our ability to comply with additional us and local laws and regulations increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights slower adoption of the internet as an advertising and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the united states and difficulties in managing operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with establishing management systems and infrastructures and staffing and managing foreign operations 

 

we have foreign exchange risk 

 

as a result of our international websites and acquisitions we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states further due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure we have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency as a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates particularly those related to the british pound sterling the euro canadian dollar and chinese renminbi foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency results in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations additionally the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation if the us dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreigncurrencydenominated balances will result in increased net assets net revenues operating expenses net income or loss as well as decreased cash flows from operations similarly our net assets net revenues operating expenses and net income or loss will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency 

our investment in elong creates risks and uncertainties relating to the laws of the people’s republic of china 

 

the success of our investment in elong a company organized under cayman law whose principal business is the operation of an internetbased travel business in the people’s republic of china is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the interpretation of china’s laws and regulations the chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike common law systems it is a system in which decided legal cases have limited value as precedent the lack of precedent causes the interpretation and enforcement of chinese law to involve uncertainties that could limit the available legal protections in addition we cannot predict the effect of future developments in china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry the internet foreign investment or licensing including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations or the preemption of local regulations by national laws in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict foreign investment in the airticketing travel agency internet content provision and advertising businesses such laws and regulations require that we establish effective control through a series of agreements with elong’s affiliated chinese entities and could restrict our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment and in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible to be enforced in china 

 

our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches 

 

in the processing of our traveler transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data 

 

we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches substantial data breaches could significantly harm our business damage our reputation expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability andor cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands 

 

these and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics 

 

we utilize internet search engines principally through the purchase of travelrelated keywords to generate traffic to our websites in a similar way a significant amount of our european business is directed to our own websites through participation in payperclick advertising campaigns on internet search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and competitively if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that further negatively affects the search engine ranking of us or our thirdparty distribution partners or changes its pricing operating or competitive dynamics in a negative manner our business and financial performance would be adversely affected

overview 

 

expedia inc is an online travel company empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research plan book and experience travel we have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers and offline retail travel agents we make available on a standalone and package basis travel products and services provided by numerous airlines lodging properties car rental companies destination service providers cruise lines and other travel product and service companies for additional information about our portfolio of brands see the disclosure set forth in part i item 1 business under the caption “management overview” 

 

trends 

 

the travel industry which includes travel agencies and travel suppliers has been characterized by rapid and significant change the us airline sector has experienced significant turmoil in recent years with several of the largest airlines seeking the protection of chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 

 

the need to rationalize high fixed cost structures to better compete with low cost carriers offering “no frills” flights at discounted prices as well as jet fuel inflation have caused the airlines to recently consider a series of merger opportunities to better share fixed costs and reduce redundant flight routes in addition carriers have aggressively pursued cost reductions in every aspect of their operations these cost reduction efforts include distribution costs which the airlines have pursued by increasing direct distribution through their proprietary websites as well as seeking to reduce travel agent commissions and overrides the airlines have also generally successfully reduced their fees with the gds intermediaries as their contracts with the gdss expired in mid to late 2006 these reductions impacted offline and online travel agents as large agencies including expedia have historically received a meaningful portion of their air remuneration from gds providers 

 

in addition the us airline industry has experienced increased load factors and ticket prices at the same time the airline carriers which participate in the expedia marketplace have been reducing their relative flight capacities while the lower cost carriers that are largely replacing this capacity generally do not currently participate in the expedia marketplace these trends have affected our ability to obtain inventory in our agency and merchant air businesses reduced discounts for merchant air tickets and limited supply of merchant air tickets for use in our package travel offerings 

 

as a result of these industry dynamics and reduced economics stemming from recently negotiated gds and airline agreements expedia’s air revenue per ticket has declined significantly since the fourth quarter of 2004 and we anticipate it will continue to decline further in 2007 

 

the hotel sector has recently been characterized by robust demand and constrained supply resulting in increasing occupancy rates and average daily rates “adr” industry experts expect demand growth to continue to outstrip supply through at least 2007 while increasing adrs generally have a positive effect on our merchant hotel operations as our remuneration increases proportionally with the room price higher adrs can impact underlying demand and higher occupancies can restrict our ability to obtain merchant hotel room allocation particularly in high occupancy destinations popular with our travel base including orlando las vegas and new york higher occupancies also have historically tended to drive lower margins as hotel room suppliers have less need for thirdparty intermediaries to meet demand a large number of our contracts with major chain hotel operators are scheduled for renewal in 2007 

 

increased usage and familiarity with the internet has driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright an independent travel tourism and hospitality research firm in 2006 49 of leisure unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online in the united states compared with 22 of european travel and 12 in the asia pacific region these penetration rates have increased considerably over the past few years and are expected to continue growing 

 

in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services over the last several years with supplier growth outpacing online growth since 2002 differentiation among the various website offerings have narrowed in the past several years and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on a feature other than price 

 

strategy 

 

we play a fundamental role in facilitating travel whether for leisure or business we are committed to providing our travelers with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by taking advantage of our critical assets — our brand portfolio our technologies and continuous innovation our global reach and our breadth of product offering in doing so we take advantage of our growing base of knowledge about our destinations suppliers and travelers based on our unique position in the travel value chain 

 

a discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows 

 

portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation 

package through our classic vacations brand we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering and facilitation of single item bookings of discounted product to complex bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium content about lodging properties and generally appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations 

 

technologies and continuous innovation expedia has an established tradition of innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as our thankyou rewards network offered in conjunction with citigroup expedia ® fare alerts travel ticker tm by hotwire ®  tripadvisor’s wikis and ect’s business intelligence toolset 

 

we intend to continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our travelers and suppliers including our current efforts in building a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform for our travelers which will extend across our portfolio of brands we expect this to result in improved flexibility and faster goforward innovation this transition should allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality and add significant personalization features we expect this transition to occur in a phased approach with portions of our worldwide points of sale migrating to the new platform beginning in 2007 for our suppliers we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands we are planning to offer more streamlined application programming interfaces for our lodging partners in 2007 to enable faster and simpler integration of realtime hotel content 

 

global reach in 2006 our international gross bookings accounted for approximately 26 of worldwide gross bookings and 28 of revenue we currently operate over 50 branded points of sale across the globe including expediabranded sites in the united states australia canada denmark france germany italy japan the netherlands norway sweden and the united kingdom our hotelscom and tripadvisor brands also maintain both us points of sale and additional points of sale outside the united states lastly we offer chinese travelers a wide array of products and services through our majority ownership in elong 

 

we intend to continue investing in and growing our existing international points of sale including the expected launch of an expediabranded site in india in 2007 we anticipate launching points of sale in additional countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce 

 

ect currently conducts operations in the united states belgium canada france germany and the united kingdom we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to small and mediumsized businesses seeking to control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint of our ect business 

 

in expanding our global reach we are leveraging our significant investment in technology operations brand building supplier integration and relationships and other areas since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching new countries introducing website features adding supplier products and services or adding valueadded content for travelers 

 

breadth of product offering in general through our websites we believe we offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time 

 

the majority of our revenue comes from transactions involving the sale of airline tickets and the booking of hotel reservations either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we are working to grow our package business as it results in higher revenue per transaction and we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other product offerings as well as by increasing the mix of revenue from advertising we derive from our travel partners and suppliers 

 

seasonality 

 

we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer as a result revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the typical trend of our seasonality in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

for more information on each of these policies see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

 

accounting for certain merchant revenue 

 

we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect from suppliers’ invoices in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience and contract terms actual revenue could be greater or lower than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior 

 

marketing promotions 

 

we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services which include inducement offers inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates we allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers and the amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used 

 

recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definitelived intangible assets 

 

goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

 

we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business working capital effects and effective income tax rate the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly traded our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because 

 

  

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

 

definitelived intangible assets we review the carrying value of longlived assets to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment an impairment loss would only be recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated fair value determined using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows our impairment analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable this analysis requires us to estimate current and future cash flows 

attributable to the group of assets the time period for which they will be held and used as well as a discount rate to incorporate the time value of money and the risks inherent in future cash flows 

 

the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

 

income taxes 

 

in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that we expect will be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 

 

other longterm liabilities 

 

various legal and tax contingencies we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

 

occupancy tax some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax or a form of sales tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations generally hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities when a customer books a room through one of our travel services we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time 

 

we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

 

we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue many of the fundamental statutes and 

regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and ecommerce it is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in part i item 3 legal proceedings 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stockbased awards we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised in 2005 we recognized significant changes in estimates related to our forfeiture rate 

 

new accounting pronouncements 

 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 2 — significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

operating metrics 

 

our operating results are affected by certain metrics that represent the selling activities generated by our travel products and services as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book their travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel including taxes fees and other charges and are generally not reduced for cancellations and refunds 

 

operating metrics reclassifications 

 

for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we adjusted allocations for certain points of sale to conform to the current period presentation the allocation adjustment impacted domestic and international gross bookings revenue and revenue margin but did not impact gross bookings revenue or revenue margin on a consolidated basis 

 

the increase in domestic and international gross bookings for 2006 compared to 2005 was 6 and 26 and would have been 5 and 29 under our prior allocation method the change in domestic and international revenue for 2006 compared to 2005 was flat and an increase of 24 and would have been a decrease of 3 and an increase of 36 under our prior allocation method the change in domestic and international revenue margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was a decrease of 76 basis points and 19 basis points and would have been a decrease of 103 basis points and an increase of 75 basis points under the prior allocation method 

 

the allocation adjustment did not have an impact on the change in domestic and international gross bookings for 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in domestic and international revenue for 2005 compared to 2004 was 7 and 50 versus 8 and 48 under our prior allocation method the decline in domestic and international revenue margin for 2005 compared to 2004 was 100 basis points and 4 basis points versus 90 basis points and 21 basis points under the prior allocation method 

 

gross bookings and revenue margin 

 

 

 

gross bookings increased 16 billion or 10 in 2006 compared to 2005 and 28 billion or 22 in 2005 compared to 2004 gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions recorded for both agency and merchant transactions recorded at the time of booking in 2006 domestic gross bookings increased 6 and international gross bookings increased 26 compared to 2005 in 2005 domestic gross bookings increased 15 and international gross bookings increased 50 compared to 2004 the increases in 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to increases in transaction volumes 

 

revenue margin which is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings decreased 59 basis points in 2006 compared to 2005 in 2006 revenue margin decreased 76 basis points in our domestic operations and 19 basis points in our international operations the decline in worldwide revenue margin was primarily due to the decline in air revenue per ticket coupled with an increase in average worldwide airfares of 9 for 2006 compared to 2005 as our remuneration generally does not vary with the price of the ticket revenue margin decreased 80 basis points in 2005 compared to 2004 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in air revenue per ticket and hotel margins in 2005 revenue margin decreased 100 basis points in our domestic operations and 4 basis points in our international operations 

 

results of operations 

 

reclassifications 

 

for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we reclassified stockbased compensation expense to the same operating expense line items as cash compensation paid to employees in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 107 

 

revenue 

 

 

 

in 2006 the increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased worldwide merchant hotel revenue partially offset by a decline in our domestic air revenue in 2006 domestic revenue growth remained flat and international revenue increased by 24 compared to 2005 

 

worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 13 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 10 increase in room nights stayed including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages as well as a 2 increase in revenue per room night revenue per room night increased due to a 6 increase in worldwide adrs partially offset by a decrease in hotel raw margins defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross revenue our merchant hotel raw margins decreased in 2006 and 2005 as hotel room suppliers have taken advantage of higher occupancies and the efficacy of their own online distribution to negotiate more favorable terms 

 

worldwide air revenue decreased 14 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 13 decrease in revenue per air ticket and a 2 decrease in air tickets sold the decrease in revenue per air ticket reflects decreased compensation from air carriers and gds providers the decrease in air tickets sold reflects the reduction in relative capacity of carriers participating in our marketplace and continued challenges in obtaining merchant air inventory in light of record industry load factors lesser availability of merchant air inventory also impacted our packages revenue which grew only 1 in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

other revenue which includes car rental destination services cruise and advertising increased by 7 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue 

 

in 2005 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide merchant hotel business worldwide air revenue growth in our car rental business and acquisitions worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 10 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase was primarily due to a 9 increase in room nights and a 1 increase in revenue per room night the increase in revenue per room night was primarily due to a 7 increase in adrs partially offset by a contraction in hotel raw margins 

 

worldwide air revenue increased 5 in 2005 compared to 2004 yearoveryear air tickets sold increased by 17 partially offset by an 11 decrease in revenue per air ticket the increase in air tickets sold is primarily due to the growth in domestic ticket sales while the decrease in revenue per air ticket resulted from less inventory allocation and lower discounting of merchant air tickets as the industry experienced high load factors our packages revenue grew 16 in 2005 compared to 2004 

 

other revenue increased by 57 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in the car rental business international revenue increased by 50 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to our acquisitions and continued growth from international websites 

 

cost of revenue and gross profit 

 

 

 

cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 costs of our data and call centers including telesales 2 credit card merchant fees 3 fees paid to fulfillment vendors for processing airline tickets and related customer services 4 costs paid to suppliers for certain destination inventory 5 reserves and related payments to airlines for tickets purchased with fraudulent credit cards and 6 stockbased compensation 

 

the cost of revenue increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher costs associated with the increase in transaction volumes the cost of revenue increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to costs associated with an increase in transaction volumes and acquisitions partially offset by lower stockbased compensation our 2005 stockbased compensation expense included a benefit related to changes in estimated forfeiture rates and capitalization of software development costs partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards related to the spinoff 

 

the year over year increases in gross profit are primarily due to the increases in revenue gross margin increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the increased mix of merchant hotel revenue which has a higher gross margin than our overall business 

 

selling and marketing 

 

 

 

selling and marketing expense relates to direct advertising and distribution expense including television radio and print spending as well as traffic generation from internet portals search engines and our private label and affiliate programs the remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs including stockbased 

compensation costs and market manager staffing in our partner services group “psg” and destination services 

 

in 2006 the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to growth in indirect psg and destination services staffing costs direct selling and marketing expense grew 7 in 2006 

 

in 2005 the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to growth in personnel costs including costs associated with the psg team expansion and destination services staffing assumed in our acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in offline marketing spend for certain businesses keyword search efficiencies and a decrease in stockbased compensation costs selling and marketing expense in 2004 includes a favorable adjustment for the reversal of 64 million associated with the resolution of a contractual dispute 

 

we expect absolute amounts spent on selling and marketing to increase in 2007 the direction of selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue in 2007 will primarily depend on our ability to drive efficiencies as well as geographic and product mix 

 

general and administrative 

 

 

 

general and administrative expense consists primarily of 1 personnelrelated costs for support functions that include our executive leadership finance legal tax and human resource functions 2 stockbased compensation costs and 3 fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting 

 

in 2006 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in our headcount and accompanying compensation resulting from our being a standalone public company for the full year as well as increased legal expenses partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to stock options that are completing their vesting cycles we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 as we have largely completed our overhead additions as a standalone public company 

 

in 2005 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to acquisitions an increase in our use of professional services and costs to build our executive teams and supporting staff levels largely in connection with being a standalone public company in addition we incurred onetime expenses specifically related to the spinoff these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation 

 

technology and content 

 

 

 

technology and content expense consists of expenses for customizing our websites amortization of website and internal software development costs localization of our websites and product development expenses such as personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation 

 

the yearoveryear expense increases were primarily due to growth in personnelrelated expenses in our software development and engineering teams as we increase our level of website innovation net of the capitalization of software development efforts that we began placing into service in the fourth quarter of 2006 and will continue to place into service in early 2007 the increase in 2005 was partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation costs 

 

given our historical and ongoing investments in our enterprise data warehouse new platform geographic expansion data centers redundancy call center technology site merchandising content management site monitoring networking corporate travel supplier integration and other initiatives as well as the incremental amortization of capitalized software placed into service in late 2006 and into 2007 we expect technology and content expense to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for both 2007 and 2008 

 

amortization of intangible assets 

 

 

 

in 2006 amortization of intangibles expense decreased compared to 2005 as some of our intangible assets were fully amortized in 2005 amortization of intangibles expense was flat compared to 2004 because the amortization of intangibles related to new business acquisitions was offset by the decrease in amortization related to intangibles that were fully amortized 

 

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 — business acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of intangible asset 

 

based on lower than expected revenue growth in 2006 we determined that our indefinite lived trade name intangible asset related to hotwire might be impaired during the third quarter of 2006 accordingly we performed a valuation of that asset and determined that its carrying amount exceeded its fair value and recognized an impairment charge of 470 million 

 

amortization of noncash distribution and marketing 

 

 

 

amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense consists mainly of advertising from universal television contributed to us by iac at spinoff we use this advertising without any cash cost 

 

in 2006 we had substantially utilized all media time we received from iac in conjunction with the spinoff with an original value of 171 million in 2005 the decrease in amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense compared to 2004 was due to a decline in the amount of television advertising that we used 

 

operating income 

 

 

 

in 2006 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the impairment charge of 470 million and higher selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses these increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit lower amortization expense related to intangible assets and lower stockbased compensation 

 

in 2005 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue which contributed to a higher gross profit and a decrease in stockbased compensation due to changes in the estimated forfeiture rates used to determine stockbased compensation partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing general and administrative and technology and content expense as discussed above in 2005 operating income included a 797 million decrease to stockbased compensation expense mainly due the benefit of 447 million related to changes in estimated forfeiture rates and capitalization of software development costs partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards related to the spinoff operating income was favorably impacted in 2004 by a 121 million net reserve adjustment primarily related to the reversal of an air excise tax reserve and the resolution of a contractual dispute 

 

operating income before amortization “oiba” 

 

 

 

in 2006 the decrease in oiba was primarily due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher revenue and the improvement in gross margin 

 

in 2005 the increase in oiba was primarily due to increases in revenue that contributed to a higher gross profit partially offset by increases in higher operating expenses 

 

definition of oiba 

 

we provide oiba as a supplemental measure to gaap we define oiba as operating income plus 1 amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense 2 stockbased compensation expense 3 amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment if applicable and 4 certain onetime items if applicable 

 

oiba is the primary operating metric used by which management evaluates the performance of our business on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the comparable gaap measures gaap financial statements and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure we present a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to gaap below 

 

oiba represents the combined operating results of expedia inc’s businesses taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of other noncash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations we believe this measure is useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

  

oiba has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of income including stockbased compensation noncash payments to partners acquisitionrelated accounting and certain onetime items if applicable due to the high variability and 

difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income such as tax rates stock price and interest rates we are unable to provide a reconciliation to net income on a forwardlooking basis without unreasonable efforts 

 

reconciliation of oiba to operating income and net income 

 

the following table presents a reconciliation of oiba to operating income and net income for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

prior to the spinoff the intercompany receivable balances were subject to a cash management arrangement with iac since we extinguished our intercompany receivable balances with iac at spinoff with a noncash distribution to iac we no longer receive interest income from iac the increase in interest income in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to the growth in our intercompany receivable balances with iac as well as an increase in the interest rates earned on these balances 

 

other interest income increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to higher cash balances which resulted from operating cash flow and the 5000 million senior unsecured notes the “notes” that we issued in august 2006 

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

in 2006 interest expense increased compared to 2005 due to interest expense related to the notes we expect interest expense to continue to increase for 2007 as a result of the notes 

 

writeoff of longterm investment 

 

in 2005 we received information regarding the deteriorating financial condition of our longterm investment in a leisure travel company and we determined that it was not likely we would recover any of our investment because the decline in its value was determined to be otherthantemporary as a result we recorded a loss related to this impairment of 234 million in 2006 we sold our investment for nil consideration 

 

other net 

 

 

 

in 2006 other net primarily includes net gains of 81 million in the fair value changes in and the settlement of derivative instruments related to the ask jeeves notes and certain stock warrants as well as net gains of 104 million from the fluctuation of exchange rates on foreign denominated assets and liabilities of us dollar functional subsidiaries 

 

in 2005 other net primarily includes an unrealized loss of 60 million in the fair value changes in derivative instruments related to the ask jeeves notes and certain stock warrants in 2004 other net was primarily due to losses of 75 million from the fluctuation of exchange rates 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

 

 

in 2006 our effective tax rate was affected by state taxes valuation allowance on certain foreign losses and nontaxable gains related to our derivative liabilities 

 

in 2005 and 2004 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign operating losses in addition in 2005 our effective tax rate was affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation expense unrealized losses on derivative instruments and loss from the writeoff of our longterm investment 

 

during 2006 we utilized all of our federal net operating losses and expect to be a full us cash taxpayer going forward for additional information about income taxes see note 10 — income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

segment operating results 

 

in the first quarter of 2006 we began reporting two segments north america and europe the change from a single reportable segment is a result of the reorganization of our business we determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance our primary operating metric for evaluating segment performance is oiba defined above we have not reported segment information for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 as it is not practicable to do so for additional information about our segment results see note 16 — segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations our cash and cash equivalents balances which were 8533 million and 2974 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 and our 10 billion 

revolving credit facility of which 948 million was available to us as of december 31 2006 representing the total of the facility less 52 million of outstanding standby letters of credit “loc” as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with our financial covenants consisting of leverage and minimum net worth related to the facility 

 

under the merchant model we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our suppliers related to these bookings generally within two weeks after completing the transaction for air travel and for all other merchant bookings which is primarily our merchant hotel business after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the supplier therefore there is generally a greater time from the receipt of cash from the traveler to the payment to the supplier and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us as long as the merchant hotel business continues to grow and our business model does not change we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows if this business declines relative to our other businesses or if there are changes to the model which compress the time between receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers our working capital benefits could be reduced as was the case to a certain degree in 2006 as we increased the efficiency of our supplier payment process 

 

seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue merchant hotel growth rates or model changes as discussed above may affect working capital which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had a deficit in our working capital of 2174 million compared to a deficit of 8480 million as of december 31 2005 the 2005 deficit resulted from the 25 billion of net intercompany receivable balances we extinguished through a noncash distribution to iac upon our spinoff on august 9 2005 

 

we anticipate continued investment in the development and expansion of our operations these investments include but are not limited to improvements to infrastructure which include our enterprise data warehouse investment servers networking equipment and software release improvements to our software code and continuing efforts to build a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform that will extend across our portfolio of brands we expect portions of our worldwide points of sale to migrate to the new platform beginning in 2007 capital expenditures are expected to increase 5 to 15 in 2007 our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions or expenditures in support of our business strategy in the event we have acquisitions this may reduce our cash balance and increase our debt legal risks and challenges to our business strategy may also negatively affect our cash balance 

 

our cash flows are as follows 

 

 

 

in 2006 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 2417 million primarily due to an increase in tax payments and a decrease in cash flows from operating income as well as a reduced benefit from working capital we made tax payments of 1261 million an increase of 1157 million over 2005 reducing cash provided by operations due primarily to iac’s payment of taxes on behalf of expedia prior to our becoming an independent public company after which point we became responsible for our tax obligations 

in 2005 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 670 million primarily due to an increase in cash flows from operating income partially offset by tax payments of 104 million an increase of 123 million from 2004 reducing cash provided by operations 

 

cash used in investing activities decreased by 6878 million in 2006 primarily due to the absence of transfers to iac of 7572 million partially offset by net cash used in acquisitions and a 403 million increase in capital expenditures in the current period in part due to capitalized software costs incurred for the development of our enterprise data warehouse and other improvements to our technology infrastructure in 2005 cash used in investing activities decreased by 1311 million from 2004 primarily due to a 5155 million decrease in transfers to iac and reduction of cash acquisitions as well as the decrease in marketable securities proceeds in 2005 compared to 2004 

 

cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2006 due to 2957 million of treasury stock activity primarily related to open market share repurchases and the 2300 million repayment of our revolving credit facility which was initially borrowed in 2005 partially offset by the net proceeds of 4953 million from the notes issuance in 2006 in 2005 cash provided by financing activities decreased due to withholding taxes for stock option exercises of 866 million that we paid on behalf of our senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares to treasury and 2005 distributions to iac versus 2004 contributions from iac partially offset by an increase in shortterm borrowings of 2307 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock option exercises of 291 million 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 we issued 5000 million notes for net proceeds of 4953 million the notes are due august 2018 and bear a fixed interest rate of 7456 with interest payable semiannually in february and august of each year beginning in february 2007 the notes are repayable in whole or in part on august 15 2013 at the option of the note holders and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at our option as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all related covenants 

 

during the second and third quarters of 2006 we repurchased in open market trades at an average per share price of 1442 20 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of 288 million 

 

we reclassified certain foreign exchange effects on our cash balances from operating activities to effect of foreign exchange rate changes for the periods presented the effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2006 showed a net increase of 507 million from 2005 due to the benefit of foreign currency appreciation during that time period versus our reporting currency as well as the increase in our cash balances 

 

on january 19 2007 we completed a tender offer pursuant to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 2200 per share for a total cost of 660 million plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offer these shares represent approximately 98 of the shares of common stock outstanding and 90 of the total number of shares of common stock and class b common stock outstanding as of december 31 2006 we paid for the tendered shares with cash onhand and by drawing 150 million on our revolving credit facility 

 

as of february 15 2007 we have board of directors authorization for additional share repurchases of up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock there is no fixed termination date for the repurchases 

 

in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

our contractual obligations and commercial commitments are as follows 

 

 44 

  

  

the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2006

 part ii item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk management 

 

market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our notes our revolving credit facility derivative instruments cash and cash equivalents merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

 

interest rate risk 

 

in august 2006 we issued 5000 million notes with a fixed rate of 7456 as a result if market rates decline our required payments will exceed those based on market rates the fair value of our notes was approximately 520 million as of december 31 2006 based on the quoted market price a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes by approximately 20 million 

 

in july 2005 we entered into a 10 billion revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility bears interest based on our financial leverage and as of december 31 2006 was equal to libor plus 050 as a result we may be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2005 our outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility was 2300 million which we fully repaid during 2006 no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2006 in 2007 we paid for the 30 million tendered shares in part by drawing on our revolving credit facility as of february 15 2007 the outstanding balance on the credit facility was 150 million 

 

we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended december 31 2006 or 2005 

 

foreign exchange risk 

 

we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses which we recognize in our consolidated statements of income to the extent practicable we minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies 

 

future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the us dollar the relative composition and denomination of the current assets and liabilities each period and our ability to maintain natural offsets of such exposures during 2006 we recorded net foreign exchange rate gains of 104 million and during 2005 and 2004 we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of 06 million and 75 million 

 

as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 

 

as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically we have not hedged foreign exchange risks we periodically review our strategy for hedging foreign exchange risks our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

 

we use crosscurrency swaps to hedge against the change in value of certain intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency for additional information about our crosscurrency swaps see note 7 — derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

equity price risk 

 

we do not maintain any minority investments in equity securities as part of our marketable securities investment strategy thus our equity price risk primarily relates to fluctuations in our stock price which affects our derivative liabilities related to outstanding ask jeeves notes we base the fair value of these derivative instruments primarily on the changes in the market price of our common stock 

 

in 2006 certain of these notes were converted at fair value for 808 million of common stock or 35 million shares as additional notes are converted the value of the derivative liability will be reduced and our equity price risk will decrease accordingly the conversion of the ask jeeves notes during 2006 reduced our obligation to issue our common stock from 43 million shares as of december 31 2005 to 08 million shares as of december 31 2006 

 

as of december 31 2006 each 100 fluctuation in our common stock will result in approximately 08 million of change in the aggregate fair value of our ask jeeves notes derivative liability an increase in our common stock price will result in a charge to our consolidated statements of income and a decrease in our common stock price will result in a credit the ask jeeves notes are due june 1 2008 upon maturity of these notes our obligation to satisfy demands for conversion ceases

 part ii item 9a controls and procedures 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

we have been evaluating designing and enhancing controls related to our internal controls over financial reporting and discussing these matters with our independent accountants and our audit committee based on these evaluations and discussions we considered what revisions improvements or corrections were necessary in order for us to conclude that our internal controls are effective as part of this process we identified a number of areas where there was a need for improvement in our internal controls over financial reporting we have completed the remediation of these areas besides the internal control improvements discussed above there were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management including our chairman and senior executive chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chairman and senior executive chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that as of december 31 2006 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective management has reviewed its assessment with the audit committee ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 as stated in their report which is included below 

 

limitations on controls 

 

management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met further no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected 

 

report of ernst  young llp independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

 

we have audited management’s assessment which is contained above under the heading “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” that expedia inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria expedia inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that expedia inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion expedia inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria 

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the 2006 consolidated financial statements of expedia inc and our report dated february 26 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

  elong our majority owned online travel service company based in beijing people’s republic of china “china” specializes in travel products and services in china elong uses webbased distribution technologies and a 24hour nationwide call center to provide consumers with consolidated travel information and the ability to access hotel reservations at discounted rates at over 3000 hotels in major cities across china elong also offers air ticketing and other travel related services such as rental cars and vacation packages travelers can access travel products and services through the websites wwwelongcom and wwwelongnet

   we are in the early stages of leveraging our historic strength as an efficient transaction processor to become a retailer and merchandiser of travel experiences our goal is to help travelers enjoy their trips from before the reservation is made to after the trip has been taken 

  our business strategy is as follows 

   leverage our portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with our extensive product offering and facilitation of single item purchases of discounted product to complex bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium content about lodging properties and generally appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destination 

  we believe our appeal to suppliers is enhanced by our brand portfolio and our international points of presence by allowing suppliers to access the broadest possible range of travelers with their product and service offerings we intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio for the benefit of travelers and suppliers 

  innovate on behalf of travelers and supplier partners we have a long tradition of innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of best fare search and dynamic packaging technologies to more recent innovations such as traveler reviews personal trip guides expedia corporate travel’s tripcontroller software and our airshopper email campaign 

  a recent innovation of note was expediacom’s introduction of its best price guarantee in early 2006 we increase our travelers’ confidence and their likelihood of purchase by assuring them that our pricing is competitive if travelers find a better price online for the same trip within 24 hours we refund the difference and we give them a 50 travel coupon towards their next qualifying trip subject to certain restrictions 

  we intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers we are currently investing in and building a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform which will extend across our portfolio of brands this will result in improved flexibility and faster goforward innovation this transition will allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality and add significant personalization features we expect this transition to occur in a phased approach with worldwide points of sale migrating to the new platform by early 2008 

  we also intend to continue innovating on behalf of our suppliers as an example we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary 

5 extranet our travelers can book reservations with over 25000 worldwide merchant hotel properties of which over 30 are now fully directconnected we expect that this number will increase in the future 

  we are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation and mining capabilities across expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse which will allow enhanced personalization on both our websites and email communications with our travelers this investment will also yield phased benefits with the full project scheduled for completion in 2008 

  expand our international and corporate travel businesses we currently operate expediabranded sites in the us canada uk germany france italy the netherlands and australia through our controlling ownership in elong we maintain a point of sale for chinese travelers and through hotelscom hotwirecom and tripadvisor brands we maintain additional points of presence beyond the us in 2005 our international gross bookings accounted for approximately 22 of worldwide gross bookings 

  we intend to continue investing in and growing our existing international points of sale in addition we anticipate launching point of sales in additional countries in the future where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce as an example we plan to enter the japanese travel sector by the end of 2006 future launches may occur under our flagship expedia brand or our other brands or through acquisition of third party brands as in the case of elong 

  ect currently conducts operations in the us canada uk france belgium the netherlands and luxembourg we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to small and mediumsized businesses seeking to control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences expanding our corporate travel business also increases our appeal to travel product and service suppliers as the average corporate traveler has a higher incidence of first class and international travel than the average leisure traveler 

  we intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint of our ect business ect currently accounts for less than 5 of our worldwide gross bookings but we anticipate growth over the next few years 

  expand our product and service offerings worldwide in general our expediacom site has offered the most comprehensive array of innovation and selection of travel products and services to travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings at expediacom as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale 

  the majority of our revenue comes from transactions involving the sale of airline tickets and the booking of hotel reservations either as standalone products or as part of package transactions we are working to grow our package business as it results in higher revenue per transaction and we also seek to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental destination services cruise and other offerings 

  leverage our scale in technology and operations the travel brands comprising expedia inc have invested over 3 billion dollars in technology operations brand building supplier integration and relationships and other areas since the launch of expediacom in 1996 

  it is our intention to continue leveraging this substantial investment by launching new countries introducing site features adding supplier products and services or adding valueadded content for travelers we have been able to launch the italy and australia websites relatively quickly and inexpensively by leveraging expedia’s existing technology and product supply 

  our scale of operations also enhances the value of technology innovations we introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example our traveler review feature — whereby expedia travelers have created over 100000 qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various sites 

   we make travel products and services available on a standalone and package basis primarily through two business models the merchant model and the agency model under the merchant model we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms airline seats car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings we are the merchant of record under the agency model we act as an agent in the transaction passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline hotel car rental company or cruise line 

  as merchant of record we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to travelers as compared to agency transactions also we negotiate inventory allocation and pricing with our suppliers which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to those provided through the agency model 

  through our expediabranded websites travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component travelers select packages based on the total package price without being provided component pricing the use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models 

  our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets hotel cruise and car rental reservations airline ticket transactions make up the majority of this business although net revenue per transaction is lower as compared to the merchant model due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency gross bookings accounted for 59 of total gross bookings for the year ended december 31 2005 

   overview we make travel products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines lodging properties car rental companies cruise lines and destination service providers we seek to build and maintain longterm strategic relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners an important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and gds partners 

  travel suppliers we strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers through a wide range of innovative targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs we maintain a partner services group which consists mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products through our brands 

  in addition we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands through this “direct connect” technology hotels can upload information about available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers in the absence of direct connect technology both of these processes are generally completed manually our travelers can book reservations with over 25000 merchant hotel properties worldwide of which over 30 are now fully directconnected we expect that this number will increase in the future 

  distribution partners gds also referred to as computer reservation services provide a centralized comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline pointto point flights or “segments” the gdss act as intermediaries between the travel 

7 suppliers and online and offline travel agencies allowing agents to reserve and book flights rooms or other travel products 

  while we have historically used worldspan as our primary gds in light of the deregulated gds environment and our desire to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers we also have distribution agreements with both amadeus and sabre 

  fulfillment partners we outsource our airline ticket fulfillment function to thirdparty suppliers this function includes the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services 

   our marketing programs are intended to build and maintain the value of our various brands drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses lower ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another our longterm success depends on our continued ability to increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner 

  our marketing channels primarily include direct andor personalized traveler communications search engine marketing and online and offline advertising in addition our expediabranded websites provide content and services to the travel channel on the msncom website in the us and msn websites in canada the united kingdom italy france and germany our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons and gift cards in addition we anticipate launching a significant loyalty effort for our travelers 

  we also make use of affiliate marketing the expediacom and hotelscombranded websites receive bookings from consumers who have clickedthrough to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites including the ian or wwwiancom and wwte or wwwwwtecom we have agreements with thousands of third party affiliate partners including a number of leading travel companies pursuant to which we pay a commission for bookings originated from their websites affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an expediabranded website a cobranded website or their own private label website we also provide our affiliates with technology and access to a wide range of products and services 

   we provide 24hour aday sevendayaweek traveler support by telephone or via email for purposes of operational flexibility we provide this support infrastructure with a combination of inhouse and outsourced call centers which are located in various locations throughout the world 

  our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are hosted by thirdparty web hosting suppliers in various locations mainly in the united states which provide communication links as well as 24hour monitoring and engineering support the web hosting facilities have their own generators and multiple backup systems significant amounts of our computer hardware for operating the websites are also located at these facilities 

  we have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace for example our expert searching and pricing platform “esp platform” which our expediabranded websites use is an industry leading platform that includes two components 1 a faresearching engine that enables broad and deep airline fare and schedule searches and 2 a common database platform that allows our expediabranded websites and our travelers to bundle diverse types of travel services together dynamically which further enables our expediabranded websites to crossmarket and package travel inventory the esp platform has been historically an important contributor to our growth in the online travel industry 

  another core technology advantage is our best fare search technology this technology essentially deconstructs the segment feeds from gds partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to reassemble multileg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler 

8   we plan to significantly invest in our technology platform over the next two years we are investing in and building a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform which will extend across our portfolio of brands this will result in longterm cost savings improved flexibility and faster goforward innovation this transition will allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality add significant personalization features and ultimately improve our ability to drive higher returnon investment in our online and offline advertising we expect this transition to occur in a phased approach with worldwide points of sale migrating to the new platform over the next two years 

  we are also adding a significant upgrade to our data aggregation and mining capabilities across expedia with the installation of an enterprise data warehouse over the next two years 

   our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets we believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online in the global travel industry indicates that these markets represent especially large opportunities for expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad 

  our competition which is strong and increasing includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers including travel agencies tour operators travel supplier direct websites and their call centers consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services and other companies offering travel search engines including metasearch engines in each case on a local regional national andor international basis 

  we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete we differentiate our brands from our competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products channel features and usability price traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice the emphasis on one or more of these factors varies depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic 

  our brands face increasing competition from travel supplier direct websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers such as loyalty programs or lower transaction fees our websites feature travel products and services from numerous travel suppliers as opposed to a single supplier we face competition from airlines hotels rental car companies cruise operators and other travel service providers whether working individually or collectively some of which are suppliers to our websites our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape including the emergence of new competitors 

   we regard our intellectual property rights including our patents service marks trademarks domain names copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success for example we rely heavily upon the software code informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service 

  we rely on a combination of laws and contractual obligations with employees travelers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct in addition there can be no assurance that others will not independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 

  we have registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks as they are developed and used we also register domain names as we deem appropriate while we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought by us for every trademark used in every country and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain 

9 name may be available or may be registered by us even if available the failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner or challenges to our intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our business result in erosion of our brand names andor limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names 

  we have considered and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions as circumstances may warrant however many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us 

  from time to time we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any such litigation regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could materially harm our business 

   we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services including registration in various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds in addition our businesses are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation including those relating to advertising and accessibility 

  as we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the european asiapacific and other international markets we may increasingly be subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those markets including laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific valueadded tax regimes for example the eec council directive on package travel package holidays and package tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package including supplier failure

 part i item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

  we operate in a very competitive environment and face increasing competition from a variety of companies with respect to products and services we offer 

  the market for the services we offer is intensely competitive we compete with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel services with respect to each of the services we offer some of our competitors including travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels may offer services and products on more favorable terms such as no fees and with unique access to loyalty programs such as points and miles many of these competitors such as airlines hotel and rental car companies are also focusing on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors like us for instance many low cost airlines which are having increasing success in the marketplace distribute their inventory exclusively through their own websites suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee and in some instances offer advantages such as bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies such as metasearch products may increase competitive pressures increased competition may result in reduced operating margins as well as loss of travelers transactions and brand recognition we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base increased competition could result in reduced operating margins loss of segment share and damage to our brand there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  over the last several years travel suppliers have generally reduced or eliminated commissions and payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries these reductions could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  a portion of our agency revenue is derived from compensation paid by travel suppliers and gds partners for bookings made through our websites we generally negotiate these commissions and fees with our travel suppliers and gds partners over the last several years travel suppliers have generally reduced or eliminated commissions and payments to travel agents and other travel intermediaries no assurances can be given that gds partners or travel suppliers will not reduce current industry compensation or our compensation either of which could reduce our agency revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations gds partners in particular face renegotiations of their longterm contracts with airlines in 2006 that could result in decreased compensation to them and to us 

11   declines or disruptions in the travel industry such as those caused by terrorism war inclement weather health concerns bankruptcies andor general economic downturns could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our business financial condition and results of operations are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry accordingly downturns or weaknesses in the travel industry could adversely affect our business travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns events or weakness in the travel industry that could negatively affect our business include price escalation in the airline industry or other travelrelated industries airline or other travel related strikes airline bankruptcies or liquidations and fuel price escalation additionally our business is sensitive to safety concerns and thus may decline after incidents of terrorism during periods of political instability or geopolitical conflict in which travelers become concerned about safety issues as a result of inclement weather such as the hurricanes that affected the markets around the gulf of mexico in 2005 or when travel might involve healthrelated risks such as avian flu such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services this decrease in demand depending on its scope and duration together with any future issues affecting travel safety could significantly and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations over the short and longterm in addition the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events such as terrorist activity or war could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs if we provide relief to affected travelers by not charging cancellation fees or by refunding the price of airline tickets hotel reservations and other travel products and services 

  we depend on our relationships with travel suppliers and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  an important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain our existing as well as build new relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system “gds” partners adverse changes in existing relationships or our inability to enter into new arrangements with these parties on favorable terms if at all could reduce the amount quality and breadth of attractively priced travel products and services that we are able to offer which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  travel suppliers are increasingly seeking to lower their travel distribution costs by promoting direct online bookings through their own websites in some cases supplier direct channels offer advantages to consumers such as loyalty programs or lower transaction fees in addition travel suppliers may choose not to make their travel products and services available through our distribution channels to the extent that consumers continue to increase the percentage of their travel purchases through supplier direct websites andor if travel suppliers choose not to make their products and services available to us our business may suffer 

  our failure to attract and retain travelers in a costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our longterm success depends on our continued ability to increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a costeffective manner in order to increase the number of traveler transactions we must capture repeat business from existing travelers and also attract new visitors to our websites and other distribution channels and convert these visitors into paying travelers similarly our corporate travel business is dependent on enlisting new corporate travelers and attracting their travel booking activity online to our corporate travel websites as well as retaining existing travelers one manner in which we costeffectively attract travelers to our websites is through affiliate programs if the number of travelers being driven to our websites through affiliates participating in these programs were to decrease significantly costs relating to our sales and marketing commitments could increase in addition we believe that rates for desirable offline and online advertising and marketing placements are likely to increase in the foreseeable future no assurances can be provided that we will be successful in acquiring new travelers in a costeffective manner 

12   we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed 

  our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization in particular the contributions of barry diller our chairman and senior executive and dara khosrowshahi our chief executive officer are critical to the overall management of the company 

  in addition our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees many of whom joined expedia recently expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of mr diller mr khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees the loss of whom could seriously harm our business in addition competition for wellqualified employees in all aspects of our business including software engineers and other technology professionals is intense our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees our business would be adversely affected 

  many of our business units use separate operational and financial systems that have not been integrated and that rely heavily on manual procedures 

  expedia is composed of multiple business units that were unaffiliated companies prior to being acquired by iac these multiple business units use disparate systems processes and personnel to support operations including bookings and fulfillment accounting and budgeting tax filings vendor payments and back office support in addition certain of the business units rely on manual procedures for critical business systems and financial reporting processes we expect to incur significant costs in our ongoing efforts to integrate and automate these disparate systems into an efficient effective and unified operation 

  the continued lack of automation and the ongoing reliance on manual procedures in critical business processes and financial reporting functions increases the risk of errors if we are not able to successfully implement the changes necessary to operate a unified system or automate critical financial reporting processes then 

   if any of these events were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations 

  if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud this could adversely affect our operating results and our brand 

  we may not be able to establish or maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting many of our internal controls and reporting systems were designed and originally implemented in smaller separate business units while they were part of iac and may not function as intended in an entity separate from iac in addition we have a new senior financial management team with only limited experience evaluating and managing these controls and processes additionally certain functions including equity transactions income taxes derivatives treasury functions and periodic reporting in accordance with sec rules and regulations were previously handled by iac and have only recently been established at the company 

  although we are taking steps to strengthen our internal controls we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and 

13 reporting in the future we also cannot be certain that the interim steps we have taken pending full implementation of these measures to preserve our ability to accurately record process and summarize financial data and prepare our financial statements and reporting will be effective many of these interim steps are time and labor intensive and rely on manual procedures which makes them difficult to maintain for an extended period and increases the risk of errors 

  any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 

  our internal control over financial reporting may not be considered effective which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and in turn have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 beginning with our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending december 31 2006 we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting such report will contain among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management such report will also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of such internal controls 

  we are currently performing the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with section 404 which is both costly and challenging although we have not identified any material weaknesses as of the date of this filing management may during this process identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if such occurs we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december 31 2006 or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on our management’s evaluation or on the effectiveness of the internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems may affect our businesses 

  a fundamental requirement for online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information such as credit card numbers or other personal information over public networks our security measures may be inadequate and if any compromise of security were to occur it could have a detrimental effect on our reputation and adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing travelers andor attract new travelers 

  we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties we rely on our affiliates’ and third party computer systems and service providers to facilitate and process a portion of our transactions any interruptions outages or delays in our systems or third party providers’ systems or deterioration in their performance could impair each company’s ability to process transactions for its travelers and the quality of service that we can offer to our travelers we do not have backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient fire flood power loss telecommunications failure breakins earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer or communications systems at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services to our travelers andor third parties for a significant period of time in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major 

14 interruption remediation may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  our expansion places a significant strain on our management technical operational and financial resources 

  we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations both domestically and internationally and anticipate expanding further to pursue growth of our product and service offerings and customer base such expansion increases the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our management operations technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions 

  there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion effectively our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth negatively affect our operating results and hard our business 

  we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with any acquisitions in addition some of the businesses acquired by us may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value 

  our future growth may depend in part on acquisitions to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions we may face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy we would also face operational risks such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses disrupting their ongoing businesses impairing management resources and their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management further the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of an acquired business will divert management time and other resources some acquisitions may not be successful and their performances may result in the impairment of their carrying value 

  certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are 

 15   our results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from the estimates of securities analysts or expectations of our investors 

  in the event that our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors the trading price of our securities may decline significantly in addition to the risks identified herein our business is sensitive to general economic conditions the health of the worldwide travel industry consumer confidence consumer retail spending trends in technology competition levels of personal discretionary income weather acts of war or terrorism safety concerns and acts of god our business is also subject to the effects of seasonality with revenue typically lowest in the first quarter of the year and highest in the third quarter 

  we have a limited operating history and our stock price is highly volatile 

  we have a relatively short operating history as a separate company and a rapidly evolving and unpredictable business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors such as 

   any of these events may cause our stock price to rise or fall and may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities a a result we may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the general market or a particular companies securities securities class actions have been brought against affected companies this litigation if instituted against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

  future volatility in our stock price could force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both 

  we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances due to our taxsharing arrangements 

  our ability to engage in significant stock transactions could be limited or restricted to preserve the tax free nature of our spinoff from iac current federal income tax law creates a presumption that the 

16 spinoff would be taxable to iac but not to its stockholders if either iac or we enter into a transaction that would result in a 50 or greater change by vote or value in iac’s or our stock ownership during the fouryear period that begins two years before the date of the spinoff unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions related to the spinoff treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a spinoff are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances including but not limited to specific factors described in the regulations in addition the regulations provide several “safe harbors” for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan these restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions which might be advantageous to our stockholders such as selling the company or substantially all of the assets of the company issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities 

  under the tax sharing agreement with iac there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the spinoff to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction including redeeming substantial amounts of our equity securities and selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets in each case for a period of 25 months following the spinoff we would be required to indemnify iac against the taxes described in the preceding sentence if such tax is incurred by a breach of our covenants under the tax sharing agreement 

  mr diller currently controls expedia if mr diller ceases to control the company liberty media corporation may effectively control the company 

  subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement mr diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of expedia stock held by liberty media corporation “liberty” accordingly mr diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of our stockholders other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25 of the members of the board of directors and matters as to which delaware law requires a separate class vote upon mr diller’s permanent departure from expedia the irrevocable proxy terminates and depending on the capitalization of expedia at such time liberty may effectively control the voting power of our capital stock mr diller through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy controls approximately 53 of the combined voting power of the outstanding expedia capital stock 

  in addition under the governance agreement each of mr diller and liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that our ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the governance agreement equals or exceeds 41 over a continuous 12month period we cannot assure you that mr diller and liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions 

  as a result of mr diller’s ownership interests and voting power and liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon mr diller’s permanent departure from us mr diller is currently and in the future liberty may be in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions including corporate transactions such as mergers business combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us as a result the market price of our securities could be adversely affected 

  actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between expedia management and directors on the one hand and the management and directors of iac on the other 

  mr diller serves as our chairman of the board of directors and senior executive while retaining his role as chairman and chief executive officer of iac and mr kaufman serves as vice chairman of both expedia and iac the fact that messrs diller and kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both iac and expedia stock could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest for each of messrs diller and kaufman when he faces decisions that may affect both iac and expedia both messrs diller and kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between iac and expedia 

17   our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of expedia who is also an officer or director of iac will be liable to expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to iac this corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between iac and expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping directorexecutive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to iac instead of expedia 

  changing laws rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing or the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses including those relating to the internet and online commerce consumer protection and privacy escheat and sales use occupancy valueadded and other taxes could decrease demand for products and services increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example there is and will likely continue to be an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet user privacy taxation and the quality of products and services furthermore the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally 

  in addition the application of various domestic and international sales use occupancy valueadded and other tax laws rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities while we believe that we are compliant with these tax provisions there can be no assurances that taxing authorities will not take a contrary position or that such positions will not have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations if the tax laws rules and regulations were amended or if current interpretations of the laws were to change adversely to us particularly with respect to occupancy or valueadded taxes the results could have an adverse affect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations 

  our international opportunities and investments involve risks relating to travel patterns practices internetbased commerce regulations and exchange rate fluctuations 

  we operate in a number of jurisdictions abroad and intend to continue to expand our international presence in order to achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter we must continue to tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of such countries and markets learning the customs and cultures of various countries particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices can be difficult costly and divert management and personnel resources our failure to learn such customs and cultures successfully could slow our international growth 

  we expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations these risks include political instability acts of terrorism unexpected changes in regulatory requirements our ability to comply with local laws and regulations increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights slower adoption of the internet as an advertising and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the united states and difficulties in managing operations due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with establishing management systems and infrastructures and staffing and managing foreign operations 

  through our international operations we also have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could negatively affect foreign exchange rates because we transact in foreign currency and record the activity in us dollars changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies could have a negative effect on our results of operations our exchange rate risk will increase as we increase our operations in international markets 

18   our investment in elong creates risks and uncertainties relating to the laws of the people’s republic of china 

  the success of our investment in elong a cayman island company whose principal business is the operation of an internetbased travel business in china is subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the interpretation of china’s laws and regulations the china legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike common law systems it is a system in which decided legal cases have limited value as precedent the lack of precedent causes the interpretation and enforcement of china law to involve uncertainties that could limit the available legal protections in addition we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the china’s legal system particularly with respect to the travel industry or the internet including the introduction of new laws changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations or the preemption of local regulations by national laws in addition the laws and regulations of china restrict foreign investment in the airticketing travel agency internet content provision and advertising businesses such laws and regulations require that we establish effective control through a series of agreements with elong’s affiliated chinese entities and could restrict our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions finally china does not have treaties with the united states or most other western countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts as a result court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which china does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment and in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible to be enforced in china 

  our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

  in the processing of our traveler transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data these and other privacy developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we rely on the internet infrastructure which may be unable to support increased levels of demand 

  the internet infrastructure may not expand fast enough to meet the increased levels of demand in particular the expected benefits from our international operations may be reduced if internet usage does not continue to grow in our overseas markets or grows at significantly lower rates compared to expected trends in addition activities that diminish the experience for internet users such as spyware spoof emails viruses and spam directed at internet users as well as viruses and “denial of service” attacks directed at internet companies and service providers may discourage people from using the internet including for commerce if consumer use diminishes or grows at a slower rate then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  we may be found to have infringed on intellectual property rights of others that could expose us to substantial damages and restrict our operations 

  we could face claims that we have infringed the patents copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others in addition we may be required to indemnify travel suppliers for claims made against them any claims against us could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation delay the release of new products or services pay damages develop new intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims these licenses if required may not be available on acceptable terms or at all as a result intellectual property claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

19   our websites rely on intellectual property and we cannot be sure that this intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others including potential competitors 

  we regard much of our content and technology as proprietary and try to protect our proprietary technology by relying on trademarks copyrights trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements in connection with our license agreements with third parties we seek to control access to and distribution of our technology documentation and other proprietary information even with all of these precautions it is possible for someone else to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our authorization or to develop similar technology independently effective trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the internet and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and expensive we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information this misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future we may need to go to court to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

  we currently license from third parties some of the technologies incorporated into our websites as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies we may be required to license additional technology we cannot be sure that such technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

securities class action litigation against iac 

  beginning on september 20 2004 twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against iac and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the federal securities laws these cases arose out of iac’s august 4 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of the company’s stock was artificially inflated by preannouncement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by iac’s travel businesses on december 20 2004 the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits appointed colead plaintiffs and designated colead plaintiffs’ counsel see in re iac interactivecorp securities litigation no 04cv7447 sdny expedia is not a party to this litigation however under the terms of its separation agreement with iac expedia has generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities if any associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the spinoff of the businesses or entities that comprise expedia following the spinoff 

  on october 18 2004 a related shareholder derivative action stuart garber derivatively on behalf of iac interactivecorp v barry diller et al  no 04603416 was commenced in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against certain of iac’s officers and directors on november 15 2004 another related shareholder derivative action lisa butler derivatively on behalf of iac interactivecorp v barry diller et al  no 04cv9067 was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against certain of iac’s current and former directors on january 24 2005 the federal district court consolidated the butler case with the securities class action for pretrial purposes only on april 11 2005 the district court issued a similar consolidation order in respect of the garber case 

  on july 5 2005 the plaintiffs in the related shareholder suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint against iac as a nominal defendant and sixteen current or former officers or directors of iac or its former travel business the complaint which is based upon factual allegations similar to those in the securities class action purports to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets unjust enrichment violation of section 14a of the exchange act and contribution and indemnification the complaint seeks an order voiding the election of the iac’s current board of directors as well as damages in an unspecified amount various forms of equitable relief restitution and disgorgement of remuneration received by the individual defendants from iac 

  on september 15 2005 iac and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the shareholder derivative suits on november 30 2005 the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions on january 6 2006 the defendants filed reply papers in further support of the motions both motions to dismiss remain pending

 part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

  expedia inc is an online travel company empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research plan book and experience travel we have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers and offline retail travel agents we make available on a standalone and package basis travel products and services provided by numerous airlines lodging properties car rental companies destination service providers cruise lines and other travel products and services 

  we refer to expedia inc and its subsidiaries collectively as “expedia” the “company” “us” “we” and “our” in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information about our portfolio of brands see the disclosure set forth in part i item 1 business under the caption “management overview” 

   the travel industry which includes travel agencies and travel suppliers has been characterized by rapid and significant change the us airline sector has experienced significant turmoil in recent years with several of the largest airlines seeking the protection of chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings the need to rationalize high fixed cost structures to better compete with low cost carriers offering no frills flights at discounted prices as well as the pressure of high priced jet fuel has caused the airlines to aggressively pursue cost reductions in every aspect of their operations these cost reduction efforts include distribution costs which the airlines have pursued by seeking to reduce travel agent commissions the airlines are also pursuing reduced fees with the gds intermediaries as their contracts with the gdss come up for renewal in 2006 in addition the us airline industry has experienced increased load factors and ticket prices these trends have affected our ability to obtain inventory in our merchant air business as suppliers lower discounting of merchant air tickets although these competitive forces have caused our air revenue per ticket to decline our worldwide air revenue has grown year over year primarily due to increases in the number of air tickets sold 

  the hotel sector has recently been characterized by robust demand and constrained supply resulting in increasing occupancy rates and average daily rates the higher occupancy rates and increasing average daily rates have had a positive effect on our operations by contributing to growth in our merchant hotel revenue 

  increased usage and familiarity with the internet has driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures according to phocuswright 29 of us leisure and unmanaged travel expenditures occurred online in 2005 more than double the 14 rate in 2002 an estimated 14 of european travel was booked online in 2005 up from just 4 in 2002 in addition to the growth of online travel agencies airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services over the last several years with supplier growth outpacing online growth since 2002 differentiation among the various website offerings have narrowed in the past several years and the travel landscape has grown extremely competitive with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on a feature other than price 

   we are in the early stages of leveraging our historic strength as an efficient transaction processor to become a retailer and merchandiser of travel experiences our business strategy to accomplish this is as follows 

  leverage our portfolio of travel brands we seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers and suppliers through our collection of industryleading brands we target several different demographics from the valueconscious traveler through our hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a hightouch 

28 customized vacation package through our classic vacations brand we believe our flagship expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers with its extensive product offering and facilitation of single item purchases of discounted product to complex bundling of higherend travel packages our hotelscom site and its international versions target travelers with premium content about lodging properties and generally appeal to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destination 

  innovate on behalf of travelers and supplier partners we have a long tradition of innovation from expediacom’s inception as a division of microsoft to our introduction of best fare search and dynamic packaging technologies to more recent innovations such as traveler reviews personal trip guides best price guarantee expedia corporate travel’s tripcontroller software and our airshopper email campaign 

  we will continue to aggressively innovate on behalf of our travelers and suppliers as an example for our travelers we are currently investing in and building a scaleable extensible serviceoriented technology platform which will extend across our portfolio of brands this transition will allow us to improve our site merchandising browse and search functionality and add significant personalization features we expect this transition to occur in a phased approach with worldwide points of sale migrating to the new platform by early 2008 for our suppliers we have developed proprietary supplieroriented technology that streamlines the interaction between some of our websites and hotel property management systems making it easier and more costeffective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands 

  expand our international and corporate travel businesses we currently operate expediabranded sites in the us canada uk germany france italy the netherlands and australia we intend to continue investing in and growing our existing international points of sale we anticipate launching additional countries in the future where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce in addition we operate sites in the people’s republic of china through elong which we acquired in january 2005 

  expedia corporate travel “ect” currently conducts operations in the us canada uk france belgium the netherlands and luxembourg we believe the corporate travel sector represents a large opportunity for expedia and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to small and mediumsized businesses seeking to control travel costs and improve their employees’ travel experiences expanding our corporate travel business also increases our appeal to travel product and service suppliers as the average corporate traveler has a higher incidence of first class and international travel than the average leisure traveler 

  expand our product and service offerings worldwide in general through our websites we offer the most comprehensive array of innovation and selection of travel products and services to travelers we plan to continue improving and growing these offerings as well as expanding them to our worldwide points of sale over time 

  leverage our scale in technology and operations the travel brands comprising expedia inc have invested over 3 billion in technology operations brand building supplier integration and relationships and other areas since the launch of expediacom in 1996 we intend to continue leveraging our substantial investment when launching new countries introducing site features adding supplier products and services or adding valueadded content for travelers we have been able to launch the italy and australia websites relatively quickly and inexpensively by leveraging our existing technology and product supply 

  for additional information about our brands see the disclosure set forth under the caption “description of business” 

   we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services for example traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring summer and holiday travel the number of bookings decreases in the fourth quarter because revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place 

29 rather than when it is booked revenue typically lags bookings by a month or longer as a result revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  to understand our financial position and results of operations it is important to understand our critical accounting policies and estimates and the extent to which we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies we prepared our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenue and expenses during the periods reported we base our estimates on historical experience where applicable and other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

   for more information on each of these policies see the notes to consolidated financial statements we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below 

   we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect from suppliers’ invoices in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued we recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears net of an allowance when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier based on historical experience actual revenue could be greater or lower than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior historically adjustments related to this account have not been material 

   goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair values of our reporting units below their carrying values the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

  we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach weighted at 75 and 25 of the indicated fair value respectively the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future our significant estimate in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of our business and effective income tax rate the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable firms in similar lines of business that are publicly traded our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such 

30 as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 

  we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because 

   the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

  indefinitelived intangible assets we base our measurement of fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of tradename and trademarks using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that the tradename and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue and expenses for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

  the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

  definitelived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review the carrying value of intangible assets with definite lives and other longlived assets which we amortize over the estimated useful lives of two to ten years on a regular basis for the existence of facts that may indicate that the assets are impaired if such facts indicate a potential impairment we estimate the fair value of the asset using appropriate valuation methodologies usually based on estimated future discounted cash flows if the fair value is determined to be less than an asset’s carrying value we then evaluate if the carrying value is deemed to be unrecoverable our analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable this analysis requires us to estimate current and future cash flows attributable to the group of assets the time period for which they will be held and used as well as a discount rate to incorporate the time value of money and the risks inherent in future cash flows 

  the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our definitelived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets which could result in an impairment 

   in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” we record income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting accordingly we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that we expect will be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense 

  we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction expectations of future taxable income the 

31 carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes as well as other relevant factors we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect to realize due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses future changes in income tax law tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results we make certain judgments and estimates therefore actual income taxes could vary from these estimates 

  in conjunction with the spinoff we entered into a tax sharing agreement with iac we will file a consolidated tax return with iac for the period from january 1 2005 to august 8 2005 there are two methods that can be used for the calculation of income taxes for that period closethe book or prorata iac has sole discretion to determine which method we have made assumptions as to how iac will choose to characterize certain transactions and as to which method it will choose should these assumptions differ materially from actions iac takes our balance sheet classification could be materially affected as could our use of certain deductions and the period in which our net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized 

   various legal and tax contingencies we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities in addition we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss in addition our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded 

  occupancy tax some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax or a form of sales tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations hotel operators generally collect and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities consistent with this practice when a customer books a room through one of our travel services the hotel charges taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel we pay those taxes invoiced by the hotel and we recover an equivalent amount from the customer we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue some tax authorities have brought lawsuits asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy tax the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time 

  we have established a reserve with respect to potential occupancy tax liability for prior and current periods consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factors include but are not limited to the number of and amount of revenue represented by jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes 

  we note that there are more than 7000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction rather we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue it is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure as well as adjust the level of reserves as developments warrant additionally we and certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in “item 3 — legal proceedings” 

   we record stockbased compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures in determining the estimated forfeiture rates we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of instruments that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of award the employee class and historical experience the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised in 2005 we recognized changes in estimates related to our forfeiture rate

operating metrics 

  our operating results are affected by certain metrics that represent the selling activities generated by our travel products and services as travelers have increased their use of the internet to book their travel arrangements we have seen our gross bookings increase reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions gross bookings include the total price due from travelers including taxes fees and other charges and are generally not reduced for cancellations and traveler refunds 

   gross bookings increased 28 billion or 22 in 2005 compared to 2004 and 32 billion or 33 in 2004 compared to 2003 gross bookings represent the total retail value of transactions recorded for both agency and merchant transactions at the time of booking in 2005 domestic gross bookings increased 15 and international gross bookings increased 50 compared to 2004 in 2004 domestic gross bookings increased 24 and international gross bookings increased 103 compared to 2003 the increases in 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and acquisitions 

  beginning january 1 2004 as part of the integration of our businesses hotelscom conformed its merchant hotel business practices with those of our other businesses as a result we commenced prospectively reporting revenue for hotelscom on a net basis we have presented certain of our 2003 information in the table above on an as reported and comparable net basis 

  revenue margin which is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings decreased 80 basis points in 2005 compared to 2004 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in air revenue per ticket and hotel margins in 2005 revenue margin decreased 90 basis points in our domestic operations and 21 basis points in our international operations revenue margin decreased by 20 basis points in 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to the decline in merchant hotel raw margins and lower air revenue per transaction this decrease was partially offset by higher merchant hotel average daily room rates and acquisitions 

33 results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

   beginning january 1 2004 as part of the integration of our businesses hotelscom conformed its merchant hotel business practices with those of our other businesses as a result we commenced prospectively reporting revenue for hotelscom on a net basis this change in reporting did not affect gross profit operating income or net income we have presented certain of our 2003 information in the tables below on an as reported and comparable net basis 

   in 2005 the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide merchant hotel business worldwide air revenue growth in our car rental business and acquisitions worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 10 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase was primarily due to a 9 increase in room nights and a 1 increase in revenue per room night the increase in revenue per room night was primarily due to a 7 increase in average daily rates offset by a contraction in hotel raw margin defined as hotel net revenue as a percentage of hotel gross bookings 

  worldwide air revenue increased 5 in 2005 compared to 2004 yearoveryear the air tickets sold increased by 17 offset by an 11 decrease in air revenue per ticket the increase in air tickets sold is primarily due to the growth in domestic ticket sales while the decrease in air revenue per tickets resulted from less inventory allocation and lower discounting of merchant air tickets as the industry experienced high load factors 

  other revenue which includes car rental destination services and cruise increased by 57 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in the car rental business international revenue increased by 48 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to our acquisitions and continued growth from international websites 

  in 2004 the decrease in revenue compared to 2003 revenue as reported was due to a change in business practice at hotelscom to conform its business practice to the approach used by the other expedia businesses our 2004 revenue increased compared to 2003 revenue on a net comparable basis primarily due to increases in worldwide merchant hotel business worldwide air revenue packages and acquisitions in 2003 revenue included a favorable adjustment of 224 million related to estimated merchant supplier payables 

  worldwide merchant hotel revenue increased 24 in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in hotel room nights stayed combined with an increase in revenue per room night yearoveryear merchant hotel room nights stayed including rooms booked as a component of packages increased 21 reflecting continued growth in international demand acquisitions and growth in our private label and affiliate programs revenue per room night increased 3 primarily due to increases in average daily room rates partially offset by a decline in merchant hotel raw margins 

  the domestic merchant hotel business in 2004 presented a more challenging environment than the prior year primarily due to increased third party distributor competition promotion by hotel chains from their own direct sites and higher overall occupancy rates these increases resulted in decreased availability of favorably priced travel products and services when compared with 2003 

  worldwide air revenue increased 34 in 2004 compared to 2003 yearoveryear the number of air tickets sold increased by 33 primarily due to the growth in domestic and international ticket sales acquisitions also contributed to the increase in worldwide air revenue 

34   international revenue increased 111 in 2004 compared to 2003 this was primarily due to growth in the hotel and air businesses from acquisitions and increased activity from international websites 

    cost of revenue primarily consists of 1 credit card merchant fees 2 reserves and related payments for product and services purchased with fraudulent credit cards and other chargebacks 3 fees paid to our fulfillment vendors for issuing airline tickets and related traveler services 4 costs for the operations of our data center and call centers including personnelrelated costs and 5 costs paid to suppliers for destination service inventory related to the portion of our destination services that is reported on a gross basis 

  the cost of revenue increase in 2005 was primarily due to costs associated with an increase in transaction volumes and acquisitions in 2004 the decrease in cost of revenue compared to 2003 revenue as reported was due to a change in business practice at hotelscom to conform its business practice to the approach used by the other expedia businesses on a comparable net basis the cost of revenue increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to costs associated with an increase in transaction volumes 

  gross profit increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes while gross margin decreased by 1 due to our acquisition of a destination services company which records its revenue on a gross basis gross profit increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the growth in our merchant hotel business including increased revenue from international websites and packages 

    selling and marketing expense relates to direct advertising and distribution expense including traffic generation from internet portals search engines private label and affiliate programs the remainder of the expense relates to personnel costs including market manager staffing in our partner services group “psg” which enhances our relationships with both supplier relationships and destination services desk personnel 

35   in 2005 the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to growth in personnel costs including costs associated with the psg team expansion and destination services staffing assumed in our acquisitions offset by a decrease in offline marketing spend for certain businesses and keyword search efficiencies selling and marketing expense in 2004 includes a favorable adjustment for the reversal of 64 million associated with the resolution of a contractual dispute 

  in 2004 the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to higher searchrelated costs and increased marketing volume offset by a favorable adjustment related to the reversal of 64 million associated with the resolution of a contractual dispute higher costs of traffic acquisition online and greater emphasis on international businesses also contributed to higher expenses our international businesses have higher selling and marketing costs compared to revenue as they are in early development stages compared to our us businesses acquisitions also contributed to the increase in selling and marketing expense 

  while we remain focused on optimizing the efficiency of our various selling and marketing channels we expect the absolute amounts spent in selling and marketing to increase over time due to continued expansion of our international businesses reduced opportunities for offline spend efficiencies inflation in searchrelated and other traffic acquisition vehicles increased marketing volumes and increased fixed costs associated with the increase in staffing in our market management area in 2006 we expect selling and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to support and invest in our brand portfolio 

    general and administrative expense consists primarily of 1 personnelrelated costs for support functions that include our executive leadership finance legal tax and human resources and 2 fees for external professional services including legal tax and accounting 

  in 2005 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to acquisitions an increase in our use of professional services and costs to build our executive teams and supporting staff levels largely in connection with being a standalone public company in addition we incurred onetime expenses specifically related to the spinoff we expect absolute amounts spent on corporate personnel and professional services to increase over time as we add personnel and continue incurring incremental costs as a standalone public company 

  in 2004 the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased personnel in administrative functions such as legal tax accounting and information technology and acquisitions in addition due to the increasing complexity of our businesses we utilized external professional services for legal tax and accounting to a greater extent in 2004 than in 2003 

    technology and content expense consists of expenses for customizing our websites amortization of website and internal software development costs localization of our websites and product development expenses such as personnelrelated costs 

  the year over year increases were primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel involved in website development and engineering teams working on increasing our level of site innovation in 2003 technology and content expense includes a 47 million writedown related to the packaging technology used by hotelscom as a result of adopting expediacom’s packaging technology 

  given the increasing complexity of our business geographic expansion initiatives in corporate travel increased supplier integration serviceoriented architecture improvements and other initiatives we expect absolute amounts spent on technology and content expenses to increase over time 

    amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets with definite lives related to business acquisitions 

  in 2005 amortization of intangibles expense was flat compared to 2004 because the amortization of intangibles related to new business acquisitions was offset by the decrease in amortization related to intangibles that were fully amortized 

  in 2004 the increase in amortization of intangibles expense was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets associated with iac’s acquisition of the minority interest in expediacom and hotelscom in 2003 as well as the acquisition of hotwirecom in 2003 

  for additional information about our acquisitions see note 5 business acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  37   stockbased compensation expense consists primarily of the amortization of the fair value of equity awards that we assumed from iac related to the expediacom and hotelscom acquisitions as well as expense for restricted stock unit “rsu” grants to employees in addition we capitalize stockbased compensation net of estimated future forfeitures related to personnel who develop our internal use software we record amortization expense related to these capitalized costs in stockbased compensation expense on a straight line basis over the useful life of the internal use software 

  in 2005 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 917 million primarily relating to stock options and rsu grants our 2005 stockbased compensation expense includes a benefit of 447 million related to changes in estimated forfeiture rates for stock options rsus and other equity compensation and capitalization of software development costs partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards related to the spinoff in 2005 we completed assessments of the estimated forfeiture rates including analyses of the actual number of instruments that had forfeited to date compared to prior estimates and an evaluation of future estimated forfeitures 

  rsus have been the primary form of stockbased awards granted to our employees since 2003 because rsus contain no exercise price the number of rsus awarded is typically less than the number of options that might have been granted in the past 

  assuming among other things that our stock price does not vary widely from present levels we anticipate the stockbased compensation expense will decrease from 1364 million before the benefit of 447 million discussed above as stock options granted in 2003 and prior are fully amortized and replaced with amortization expense from rsu 

  in 2004 the increase in stockbased compensation expense was due to acquisitions of expediacom and hotelscom in 2003 which resulted in the conversion of all expediacom and hotelscom stock options warrants and rsu grants into iac equity grants and valued at the time of conversion 

    amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense consists mainly of advertising from universal television contributed to us by iac at spinoff we use this advertising without any cash cost 

  in 2005 the decrease in amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense compared to 2004 was due to a decline in the amount of television advertising that we used 

  in 2004 the decrease in amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense compared to 2003 was primarily due to the termination of hotelscom’s distribution agreement with travelocity in 2003 

  38   in 2005 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue which contributed to a higher gross profit and a decrease in stockbased compensation due to changes in the estimated forfeiture rates used to determine stockbased compensation offset by an increase in selling and marketing general and administrative and technology and content expense as discussed above in 2005 operating income included a 797 million decrease to stockbased compensation expense mainly due the benefit of 447 million related to changes in estimated forfeiture rates for stock options rsus and other equity compensation and capitalization of software development costs partially offset by a modification charge on stock option awards related to the spinoff operating income was favorably impacted in 2004 by a 121 million net reserve adjustment primarily related to the reversal of an air excise tax reserve and the resolution of a contractual dispute 

  in 2004 the decrease in operating income was due to an increase in the amortization of intangibles principally due to the increase in intangible assets upon iac’s acquisition of the minority interest in hotelscom and expediacom in 2003 and other acquisitions an increase in stockbased compensation due to the expediacom and hotelscom mergers in 2003 partially offset by a decrease in noncash distribution and marketing expense due to the termination of hotelscom distribution agreement with travelocity and a decrease in merger costs operating income was favorably impacted by a 47 million writedown relating to packaging technology by hotelscom in 2003 

    in 2005 the increase in oiba was primarily due to increases in revenue that contributed to a higher gross profit offset by increases in selling and marketing general and administrative and technology and content expense discussed above 

  in 2004 the increase in oiba was primarily due to increases in revenue that contributed to higher gross profit profitability from our european operations and acquisitions partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing general and administrative and technology and content expense discussed above 

   we provide oiba as a supplemental measure to gaap we define oiba as operating income plus 1 amortization of noncash distribution and marketing expense 2 stockbased compensation expense 3 amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment if applicable and 4 certain onetime items if applicable 

  oiba is one of the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results this nongaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the nongaap measure presented by also providing the comparable gaap measures gaap financial statements and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the nongaap measure we present a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure from gaap to nongaap below 

  oiba represents the combined operating results of expedia inc’s businesses taking into account depreciation which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business but excluding the effects of other non 

39 cash expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operations we believe this measure is useful to investors for the following reasons 

   oiba has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to expedia inc’s statements of income of certain expenses including stockbased compensation noncash payments to partners acquisitionrelated accounting and certain onetime items due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect net income such as interest rates and tax rates we are unable to provide reconciliation to net income on a forwardlooking basis without unreasonable efforts 

   the following table presents a reconciliation of oiba to operating income and net income for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 40 

    interest income increased due to the growth in our intercompany receivable balances with iac as well as an increase in the interest rates earned on these balances the intercompany receivable balances were covered by a cash management arrangement with iac until the spinoff because we extinguished our intercompany receivable balances with iac at spinoff we expect our interest income to decrease significantly in 2006 in 2005 other interest income expense net includes interest expense of 18 million related to shortterm borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

    in 2005 we received information regarding the deteriorating financial condition of our longterm investment in a leisure travel company and determined that it was unlikely that we would recover any of our investment because the decline in its value was otherthantemporary as a result we recorded a writeoff related to this impairment of 234 million which consisted of 225 million of preferred stock and 09 million of stock warrants 

    in 2005 other net primarily includes an unrealized loss of 60 million in the fair value of derivative instruments related to the ask jeeves notes and certain stock warrants as well as losses from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates for additional information about our derivative instruments see note 10 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  in 2004 and 2003 other net was primarily due to losses from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates 

    our effective tax rate was 45 39 and 38 in 2005 2004 and 2003 

  in 2005 and 2004 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign operating losses in addition in 2005 our effective tax rate was affected by nondeductible stockbased compensation expense unrealized losses on derivative instruments and loss from the writeoff of our longterm investment 

  in 2003 our effective tax rate was higher than the 35 statutory rate primarily due to state taxes 

  for additional information about income taxes see note 13 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

financial position liquidity and capital resources 

   in july 2005 we entered into a 10 billion revolving credit facility as of december 31 2005 our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was 2300 million which consisted of shortterm borrowings we repaid this balance during the first quarter of 2006 and as of march 24 2006 we did not have any outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all related financial covenants 

  in the merchant business we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings we pay our suppliers related to these bookings approximately one week after completing the transaction for air travel and for all other merchant bookings after the travelers’ use and the subsequent billing from the supplier therefore especially for the hotel business which represents the majority of our merchant bookings there is generally some time from the receipt of the cash from the traveler to the payment to the suppliers 

  as long as the merchant hotel business continues to grow as it has historically and our business model does not change we expect that the change in working capital will continue to be positive if these businesses decline or if the model changes it could negatively affect our working capital as of december 31 2005 we had a deficit in our working capital of 8480 million compared to a positive amount of 13 billion as of december 31 2004 the fluctuation in our working capital was due to the 25 billion net intercompany receivable balance we extinguished through a noncash distribution to iac upon our spinoff on august 9 2005 

  seasonal fluctuations in our merchant bookings affect our cash flows during the first half of the year hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital during the second half of the year this pattern reverses while we expect the impact of seasonal fluctuations to continue changes in the rate of growth of merchant bookings may affect working capital which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations 

  we anticipate continued investment in the development and expansion of our operations these investments include but are not limited to improvements of our product support infrastructure marketing and sales strategy corresponding distribution channels and existing technology our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions legal risks and to support our business strategy in 

42 the event we have acquisitions this may reduce our cash balance and increase our debt legal risks and challenges to our business strategy may also negatively affect our cash balance 

  in our opinion available cash funds from operations and available borrowings in the form of the revolving credit facility will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable liquidity needs 

   in 2005 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 470 million to 8499 million this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash flows from operating income in addition we made tax payments of 111 million an increase of 39 million from 2004 reducing cash provided by operations cash used in investing activities decreased by 1311 million from 2004 primarily due to a 5155 million decrease in transfers to iac and the absence of the 2004 cash acquisitions cash provided by financing activities decreased due to withholding taxes for stock option exercises of 866 million that we paid on behalf of a senior executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares and distributions to iac of 528 million offset by an increase in shortterm borrowings of 2308 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock option exercises of 291 million 

  in 2004 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1588 million to 8029 million this increase was primarily due to cash flows from the merchant hotel business and changes in working capital in addition we made tax payments of 73 million an increase of 28 million from 2003 reducing cash provided by operations cash used in investing activities decreased 3191 million from 2003 primarily due to a 13 billion decrease in marketable securities purchased and a 4435 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions offset by a 7244 million increase in transfers to iac and a 6068 million decrease in marketable securities sales proceeds these net transfers of our excess cash to iac facilitated centralization of their investment management these activities ceased upon spinoff cash provided by financing activities decreased 4784 million in 2004 reflecting a decrease in iac contributions of 5249 million 

   our contractual obligations and commercial commitments are as follows 

 43    the following table presents our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2005 

   for additional information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments see note 16 commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements other than the items described above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2005

 part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk management 

  market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and market prices our exposure to market risk includes our revolving credit facility derivative instruments and marketable and debt securities we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures our objective is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 

   in july 2005 we entered into a 10 billion revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility bears interest based on our financial leverage and as of december 31 2005 was equal to libor plus 050 as a result we may be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

  as of december 31 2005 our outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility was 2300 million we repaid this balance in march 2006 we did not experience any significant impact from changes in interest rate during the year ended december 31 2005 

   we conduct business in certain international markets primarily in australia canada china and the european union because we operate in international markets we have exposure to different economic climates political arenas tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in us dollars we mitigate this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our foreign currency denominated current assets and current liabilities changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and these other currencies will result in a transaction gain or loss which we will recognize in our consolidated statements of income 

44   as we increase our operations in international markets our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth inflation interest rates governmental actions and other factors these changes if material could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 

  as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects yearoveryear comparability of operating results historically we have not hedged foreign exchange risks because we generally reinvested cash flows from international operations locally we periodically review our strategy for hedging foreign exchange risks our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to minimize our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  we use crosscurrency swaps to hedge against the change in value of an asset denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency for additional information about our crosscurrency swaps see note 10 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

   we do not maintain any investments in equity securities as part of our marketable securities investment strategy our equity price risk relates to fluctuation in our stock price which affects our derivative liabilities related to outstanding stock warrants and ask jeeves notes we base the fair value of the these derivative instruments on the changes in the market price of our common stock 

  in january 2006 certain of these notes were converted for approximately 682 million of common stock or 26 million shares as notes conversion occur and reduce the value of the derivative liabilities our equity price risk will decrease accordingly the ask jeeves notes are due june 1 2008 upon maturity of these notes our obligation ceases 

  as of march 1 2006 each 100 fluctuation in our common stock will result in approximately 17 million change in the aggregate fair value an increase in our common stock price will result in a charge to our consolidated statements of income and visa versa for a decrease in our common stock price

 part ii item 9a controls and procedures tableend 

   the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

45   as required by rule 13a15b under the securities exchange act of 1934as amended the “exchange act” our management including our chairman and senior executive chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act 

  based upon that evaluation our chairman and senior executive chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in our filings with the sec under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

   we have been evaluating designing and enhancing controls related to processes that previously were handled by iac including equity transactions income taxes derivatives treasury functions and periodic reporting in accordance with sec rules and regulations we also have been evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting and discussing these matters with our independent accountants and our audit committee 

  based on these evaluations and discussions we consider what revisions improvements or corrections are necessary in order for us to conclude that our internal controls are effective as part of this process we have identified a number of areas where there is a need for improvement in our internal controls over financial reporting we are in the process of designing and implementing controls and processes to address the issues identified through this review 

  as part of this ongoing process to improve our internal controls over financial reporting we have taken the following actions 

   except as set forth in ae above there were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we expect to continue monitoring and evaluating our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in an effort to improve their overall effectiveness in the course of this evaluation we anticipate we will continue to modify and refine our internal processes over several reporting periods
