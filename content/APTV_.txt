refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 22 segment reporting to the audited consolidated financial statements for financial information about our business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes the 25 largest automotive oems in the world and in 2021 31 of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth our ten largest platforms in 2021 were with eight different oems in addition in 2021 our products were found in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states “us” in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 14 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require while also serving key growth market oems 

our industry 

the automotive technology and components industry provides critical technologies components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles in addition the industry is increasingly progressing towards softwaredefined vehicles becoming critical elements of the overall automotive ecosystem overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2021 the industry experienced a minimal increase in global production schedules which followed the unusually low 2020 production rates the lack of significant growth in 2021 was primarily due to the impacts of global supply chain disruptions including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage and follows the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 which was driven by the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic as a result 2021 global vehicle sales and production rates continue to be significantly below historic levels compared to the unusually low 2020 production rates vehicle production in 2021 increased by 2 in china 1 in north america and 18 in south america our smallest region and decreased by 4 in europe demand for automotive components in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers electric vehicle developers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement we aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that 

incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in every region regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the largest markets in which we operate have already instituted regulations requiring reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2022 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide “co 2 ” emissions over the next ten years for example in the us the environmental protection agency in december 2021 finalized more stringent ghg emissions standards for passenger car and light trucks for model years 20232026 these and other standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are challenged to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions we are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms we are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce co 2 emissions and increase fuel economy helping to make the world greener 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents we are pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles we also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as overtheair ota technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect marketrelevant data from connected vehicles 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

convergence of safe green and connected solutions in new mobility and autonomous driving 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co 2 emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements 

in an effort to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries strengthen our capabilities in softwaredefined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wind river in january 2022 the transaction is expected to close in mid2022 subject to regulatory approvals and 

customary closing conditions wind river is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge previously in 2021 we executed a strategic collaboration agreement with wind river to develop a software toolchain for various automotive applications 

we are also continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies 

in march 2020 to further our leadership position in the automated driving space we completed a transaction with hyundai motor group “hyundai” to form motional inc “motional” a joint venture focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies motional brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest oems we expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of productionready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space 

we believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe reliable and accessible reality furthermore we anticipate motional’s presence in both north america and asia along with the global presence of both aptiv and hyundai to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements 

motional began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and anticipates it will have a productionready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers meal delivery providers fleet operators and automotive manufacturers to test at prototype scale in 2022 with higher volumes available for deployment in 2023 in addition motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston las vegas los angeles and singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the safe green and connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems select suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets certain key growth markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation

competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in best cost countries such as china and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as intelligent systems software automated driving and mobility solutions which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2021 



1 on january 16 2021 fiat chrysler automobiles nv “fca” and psa peugeot citroën “psa” psa executed a merger agreement to form a new combined company stellantis net sales to fca and psa before the date of the merger are included in net sales to stellantis in the table above for the year ended december 31 2021 

supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally one of our largest customers gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2021 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials however as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations our balance of productive raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels these 

changes to the production environment have been primarily driven by the worldwide semiconductor shortage we continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital normally we do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry for instance in 2021 the industry has been subjected to increased pricing pressures specifically in relation to these commodities which have increased significantly in price at times during the year we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our signal and power solutions segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

in general our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models 

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 155000 people 27000 salaried employees and 128000 hourly employees in addition we maintain a contingent workforce of 36000 to accommodate fluctuations in customer demand we are a global company serving every major market worldwide and our workforce as of december 31 2021 is regionally aligned as follows

health and safety 

we prioritize the health and safety of all our employees we routinely assess occupational health and safety risks including internal audits for all manufacturing sites assessing among other things lost workday case rates safety incident rates safety habits training and number of training hours per employee we are a leader in workplace safety as reflected in our lost time injury frequency rate of 0129 cases per million hours worked for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 0132 for the prior year in addition our lost workday case rate per 100 employees was 0027 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 furthermore we are committed to ensuring all of our manufacturing sites are iso 45001 certified by 2025 

many of the safety protocol responses we implemented as a result of the covid19 pandemic remained in place in 2021 and are designed to make all of aptiv’s sites safer including extensive cleaning of our facilities enhanced communications about safety protocols and building capacity limits as well as daily health screenings for onsite employees and mandatory mask use when indoors as determined on a sitebysite basis 

commitment to environmental sustainability 

sustainability has always been core to aptiv’s business values and culture we believe this strong foundational focus on sustainability makes aptiv a partner of choice for our customers a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate while a key part of our business is to design solutions that help transition the world’s vehicles to cleaner sources of power we are also committed to reducing our environmental footprint throughout our operations around the globe we aim to reduce our environmental footprint by decreasing our carbon footprint reducing waste generated and consuming less water in our operations expenditures required to meet our environmental sustainability goals which are described below are included in our normal budgeting process 

decreasing our carbon footprint 

in 2021 we committed to becoming carbonneutral in our global operations by 2030 and to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2040 as we transition away from carbonintensive energy and processes in our global operations to achieve these commitments we are targeting 

• reducing scope 1 and 2 co2e emissions by 25 by 2025 

• maintaining annual certification of all major manufacturing sites to the iso 14001 standard 

• certifying ten of the most energyintensive sites to the iso 50001 certification by 2025 

• sourcing 100 of electricity for operations from renewable sources by 2030 and 

• delivering only carbonneutral products by 2039 from sourcing to disposal 

key to achieving these goals is our global environmental health and safety and sustainability management system which helps to keep us aligned with stringent environmental health and safety regulations and provides a structure for continuous improvement this system applies to all aptiv sites which means that in some countries our procedures go beyond local regulations and requirements this system is continuously updated to ensure that our procedures remain up to date 

reducing our water usage and waste generated 

while our operations are not water intensive we include water in our environmental risk management approach we identify locations where we operate that are waterscarce and take action to reduce our water consumption accordingly while also striving to comply with best practices in lowerrisk locations our goal is to reduce water consumption in highrisk waterscarce locations by 2 per year 

we are also committed to reducing waste with a waste recycled target volume of recycled waste divided by total waste volume of 80 we continue to strive to actively reduce and manage waste across our manufacturing operations as well as in our offices we are creating packaging that uses less material and we continue to strive to increase the share of waste and excess materials we divert to recycling 

additional information regarding our environmental sustainability and human capital initiatives is available in our annual sustainability report located on our website at wwwaptivcomaboutsustainability  nothing on our website including the aforementioned sustainability report shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to us federal state and local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge climate change hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such laws and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot ensure that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million 4 million and 4 million respectively we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns or failures electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters delayed customs processing the spread of an infectious disease virus or other widespread illness and more additionally as we focus operations in best cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of any single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products could force us to cease production potentially for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

due to various factors that are beyond our control there are currently global supply chain disruptions including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage the semiconductor supply shortage due in part to increased demand across multiple industries is impacting production in automotive and other industries we anticipate these supply chain disruptions will persist throughout 2022 we along with most automotive component manufacturers that use semiconductors have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of oems because of events which are outside our control including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic the global semiconductor shortage fires in our suppliers’ facilities unprecedented weather events in the southwestern united states and other extraordinary events although we are working closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at least some responsibility for their lost production and other costs while no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these customer expectations or any other future claims we do not currently believe a loss is probable we will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of these supply chain disruptions and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business 

in addition we are carrying critical inventory items and key components and we continue to procure productive raw material and noncritical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers’ vehicle production schedules however as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations our balance of productive raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of december 31 2021 we will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic including its variants and measures taken in response thereto impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the global spread of the covid19 pandemic which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 negatively impacted the global economy disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in global financial markets in 2020 with various direct and indirect adverse impacts continuing throughout 2021 and into 2022 

in 2021 the pandemic continued to impact economies and communities throughout the world including in all of the markets and regions served by aptiv although vaccines have been introduced that are expected to reduce the effect of covid19 governmental authorities throughout the world continue to implement numerous measures aimed at containing and mitigating the effects of the pandemic including renewed travel bans and restrictions quarantines social distancing orders “lockdown” orders and shutdowns of nonessential activities although our manufacturing facilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting from the covid19 pandemic in 2021 we cannot assure that this will not be the case in the future further it is possible that governmental authorities within jurisdictions in which our business operates may implement vaccination mandates which could impact our workforce and operations although we cannot predict the impact of vaccination mandates any future mandates could result in increased employee attrition which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

the direct adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic on aptiv which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020 included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter of 2020 in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america during the second half of 2020 many of these impacts abated resulting in increased sales and profitability from the levels observed earlier in 2020 

during 2020 we took decisive actions to enhance our financial flexibility and minimize the impact on our business such as the ramping down of certain production facilities in response to customer plant closures and changes in vehicle production schedules imposing certain travel restrictions suspending the company’s ordinary share cash dividend and ordinary share repurchase program issuing 23 billion combined of preferred and ordinary shares extending substantially all of our existing credit agreement’s maturity to august 2022 which was further extended in its entirety to 2026 during the second quarter of 2021 and actively managing costs capital spending and working capital to further strengthen our liquidity 

however certain direct and indirect adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic persisted throughout 2021 and are expected to continue into 2022 including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage as a result due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the ultimate impacts of the covid19 pandemic and resulting potential future governmental actions and economic impacts it is possible that these adverse impacts could reoccur resulting in further adverse impacts on our future operating earnings and cash flows in addition to the extent the factors indicated above adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors in this section 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing supply chain disruptions and other factors including global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in 2021 the industry experienced a minimal increase in global production schedules which followed the unusually low 2020 production rates the 

lack of significant growth in 2021 was primarily due to the impacts of the global supply chain disruptions including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage and follows the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 which was driven by the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic as a result 2021 global vehicle sales and production rates continue to be significantly below historic levels compared to the unusually low 2020 production rates vehicle production in 2021 increased by 2 in china 1 in north america and 18 in south america our smallest region and decreased by 4 in europe as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in certain regions uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition cyclical and short product life cycles reduced consumer demand patterns and industry consolidation when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our revenues and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems’ vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth 

the global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry particularly in countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies and advanced software these entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance which could adversely affect the future growth of the company additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future 

in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive 

technologies different than those being developed by us there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to respond quickly and effectively to this evolutionary process our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key geographic market and have identified intelligent systems software advanced driver assistance systems autonomous driving technologies mobility solutions and high voltage electrification systems as key product markets we believe these markets are likely to experience substantial longterm growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the asia pacific region or if we are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues for example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to evolving guidance issued by the us department of transportation “dot” regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of these systems including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads there remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the dot or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction it is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs 

we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in developing marketrelevant products depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies in particular motional is dependent on the success of our relationship with hyundai our joint venture partner there are certain risks involved in such relationships as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations may be acquired by other companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement may compete with us may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs which could adversely affect our business and operational results 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 39 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 accordingly our revenues may be adversely affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share for instance the covid19 pandemic and the worldwide semiconductor shortage adversely impacted the automotive industry in 2021 and 2020 resulting in reduced vehicle production schedules and sales from historical levels which adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in addition certain united automobile workers “uaw” represented employees at gm initiated a labor strike in september 2019 lasting approximately six weeks in duration as gm is one of our largest customers this labor strike adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 furthermore because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive technology and components market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the longterm we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example automotive production in china experienced minimal growth of 2 in 2021 primarily due to the adverse impacts of the global supply chain disruptions impacting the industry and foreign trade uncertainties which followed a decrease of 3 in the region in 2020 our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china continue to experience minimal growth or decrease our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to three percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their 

ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products for example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and costcutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with us oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in key growth markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy our customers’ production schedules acquisitions of or consolidations among customers and disruptions in the supply of raw materials or other supplies used in our customers’ products due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our thirdparty suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 38 million as of december 31 2021 the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to these nonus defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 423 million at december 31 2021 of which 17 million is included in accrued liabilities 435 million is included in longterm liabilities and 29 million is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring actions will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facility’s building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s value is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not met the company then performs a quantitative assessment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the 

reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company recognizes an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit it is possible that we could incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability for instance certain uaw represented employees at gm initiated a labor strike in september 2019 lasting approximately six weeks in duration as gm is one of our largest customers this labor strike adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 67 of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 came from sales outside the us which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro and chinese yuan renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in various national and local jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 67 of our net revenue came from sales outside the us international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally including 

• exposure to local economic political and labor conditions 

• unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or fiscal policy including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the us and other countries 

• tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers 

• expropriation and nationalization 

• difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems 

• reduced technology data or intellectual property protections 

• limitations on repatriation of earnings 

• withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries 

• investment restrictions or requirements 

• violence and civil unrest in local countries and 

• compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable antibribery laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws of various other countries 

additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events terrorist events and hostilities complications due to natural nuclear or other disasters or the spread of an infectious disease virus or other widespread illness for instance the global spread of covid19 which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 caused certain governmental authorities worldwide to initiate “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities which at times included extended shutdowns of businesses in the impacted regions this or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in mexico china or other countries in which we operate could result in social economic and labor instability these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results furthermore management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify quantify and assess threatened duties taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results if enacted 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our longterm strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed in addition the failure to realize the expected benefits of any past or future acquisition or the failure to complete any pending acquisitions could adversely affect our business 

we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and we also expect to complete the acquisition of wind river in mid2022 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned for instance the proposed acquisition of wind river which we agreed to acquire in january 2022 is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties which may result in the failure to realize the expected benefits of the transaction we expect wind river to become a foundational element of executing our business strategy as wind river’s industryleading software services are complementary to our existing portfolio of software solutions advanced compute and smart architectures and we intend to establish wind river as the cornerstone of our software strategy if we are not successful in establishing wind river in this regard the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

in addition we intend to acquire wind river and pay other required fees and expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition utilizing cash on hand and proceeds from new indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute such financing transactions on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all and the failure to do so could adversely impact our business and the success of the proposed acquisition this possibility along with other risks and uncertainties could result in the inability to complete the proposed transaction any delay in the completion of the proposed transaction could also among other things result in additional transaction costs 

furthermore we may not be successful in fully or partially integrating companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be 

materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies profitably may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances furthermore if the benefits of an acquisition do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts the market price of our ordinary shares prior to the closing of the proposed acquisition may decline 

digital technologies are increasingly crucial to our products and our business any significant disruptions such as disruptions caused by cyberattacks to our information technology capabilities or those of third parties with which we do business could adversely impact our business similarly as mobility becomes increasingly connected electric and autonomous vehicles increasingly depend on the proper functioning of their software and microelectronics 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology capabilities both internally and externally our capabilities as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are crucial to operations and contain confidential personal information businessrelated information or intellectual property these capabilities are also susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyberattacks and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged or go undetected cyberattacks are continually increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity although we have and continue to employ capabilities processes and other security and privacy measures designed to prevent detect and mitigate the risk of such events including but not limited to geographically diverse and resilient infrastructure thirdparty risk management and the implementation of proactive security and privacy measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology capabilities could result in a confidentiality integrity or availability data breach and adversely affect our ability to manage and keep operations running efficiently and effectively and could result in significant costs regulatory investigations fines or litigation incidents that result in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products or result in a personal data breach could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations in addition as a result of the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic some of our employees are continuing to work from home on a fulltime or parttime basis which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks 

some of our products including but not limited to safetycritical products contain complex digital technologies designed to support today’s increasingly connected vehicles although we continue to employ capabilities processes and other security and privacy measures designed to reduce risks of cyberattacks against our products such measures may not provide absolute security and in turn privacy and may not sufficiently mitigate all potential risks under all scenarios failure of such products to effectively protect against attacks targeted at our products can negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects customers financial condition and operating results 

further engineering and maintaining security for our systems and products may require significant costs however failing to properly respond to and invest in information technology and cybersecurity advancements may limit our ability to attract and retain customers prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors or inhibit our ability to meet regulatory industry or other compliance requirements 

to date we have not experienced a system failure cyberattack or security breach that has resulted in a material interruption in our operations or material adverse effect on our financial condition our board of directors regularly reviews relevant information technology and cybersecurity matters and receives periodic updates from information technology and cybersecurity subject matter experts as part of its risk assessment procedures including analysis of existing and emerging risks as well as plans and strategies to address those risks while we continuously seek to expand and improve our information technology systems and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures there can be no assurance that we can adequately anticipate all trends of the market technology landscapes and threat landscapes and there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

• lose net revenue 

• incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support 

• experience delays cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products 

• experience increased product returns or discounts or 

• damage our reputation 

all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental health and safety and climate change regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing among other things 

• the generation storage handling use transportation presence of or exposure to hazardous materials 

• the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water 

• climate change 

• the incorporation of certain chemical substances into our products including electronic equipment and 

• the health and safety of our employees 

we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to thirdparty disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million at december 31 2021 for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves 

we also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

environmental laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time specifically increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may continue to result in more international regional federal state and local requirements or pressure from key stakeholders to reduce or mitigate climate change which could impose significant operational restrictions costs and compliance burdens upon our business or our products while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws and regulations and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of ghg or climate change rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy furthermore if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals and reduce our impact on the environment or if there becomes a public perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change and sustainability we could be exposed to negative publicity which could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will need to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or incur additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning activities such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental health and safety issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental health and safety tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2021 the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2021 claims totaling approximately 95 million using december 31 2021 foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2021 we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 20 million using december 31 2021 foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and trade names and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased existing income tax laws regulations and related international agreements provide guidance and direction on the allocations of income and applicable taxing rights among the countries in which we operate 

changes in these guidelines are being contemplated at the local national regional particularly in the european union and global levels through organizations like the g20 and the organisation for economic cooperation and development any changes especially if made inconsistently could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws additionally in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

general risk factors 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

brazil matters 

aptiv conducts business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental health and safety tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while aptiv believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2021 the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2021 claims totaling approximately  95 million using december 31 2021 foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2021 the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of  20 million using december 31 2021 foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and aptiv’s results of operations could be materially affected the company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero to  75 million

in march 2020 to further our leadership position in the automated driving space we completed a transaction with hyundai to form motional a joint venture focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies motional brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest oems we expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of productionready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space 

we believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe reliable and accessible reality furthermore we anticipate motional’s presence in both north america and asia along with the global presence of both aptiv and hyundai to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements 

motional began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and anticipates it will have a productionready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers meal delivery providers fleet operators and automotive manufacturers to test at prototype scale in 2022 with higher volumes available for deployment in 2023 in addition motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston las vegas los angeles and singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry as a result of our substantial investments 

and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

however there are many risks associated with these evolving areas including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and evolving regulations such as the federal guidance for automated driving systems published by the us department of transportation while we believe we are wellpositioned in these markets the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in key growth markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards key growth markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  in 2021 we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses while continuing to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments 

in addition in january 2022 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wind river for approximately 43 billion the transaction is expected to close in mid2022 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions with aptiv and wind river’s synergistic technologies and decades of experience delivering safety critical systems the company believes this acquisition will accelerate the journey to a softwaredefined future of the automotive industry furthermore in december 2021 aptiv agreed to invest €200 million in tttech auto ag a leading provider of safetycritical middleware solutions for advanced driverassistance systems and autonomous driving applications the transaction is expected to close in q1 2022 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions together these actions accelerate our software strategy broaden our portfolio of technology solutions and enable us to capitalize on opportunities requiring comprehensive software solutions 

accelerating an electric zeroemissions future in 2021 we committed to becoming carbonneutral in our global operations by 2030 and to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2040 as we transition away from carbonintensive energy and processes in our global operations we also continue to focus on minimizing the overall environmental impact of vehicles as a key part of our overall business strategy we believe that this strong foundational focus on sustainability makes aptiv a partner 

of choice for our customers a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

covid19 pandemic the global spread of the covid19 pandemic which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 negatively impacted the global economy disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in global financial markets in 2020 with various direct and indirect adverse impacts continuing throughout 2021 and into 2022 

in 2021 the pandemic continued to impact economies and communities throughout the world including in all of the markets and regions served by aptiv although vaccines have been introduced that are expected to reduce the effect of covid19 governmental authorities throughout the world continue to implement numerous measures aimed at containing and mitigating the effects of the pandemic including renewed travel bans and restrictions quarantines social distancing orders “lockdown” orders and shutdowns of nonessential activities although our manufacturing facilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting from the covid19 pandemic in 2021 we cannot assure that this will not be the case in the future further it is possible that governmental authorities within jurisdictions in which our business operates may implement vaccination mandates which could impact our workforce and operations although we cannot predict the impact of vaccination mandates any future mandates could result in increased employee attrition which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

the direct adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic on aptiv which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020 included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter of 2020 in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america during the second half of 2020 many of these impacts abated resulting in increased sales and profitability from the levels observed earlier in the year 2020 

during 2020 we took decisive actions to enhance our financial flexibility and minimize the impact on our business such as the ramping down of certain production facilities in response to customer plant closures and changes in vehicle production schedules imposing certain travel restrictions suspending the company’s ordinary share cash dividend and our ordinary share repurchase program issuing 23 billion combined of preferred and ordinary shares extending substantially all of our existing credit agreement’s maturity to august 2022 which was further extended in its entirety to 2026 during the second quarter of 2021 and actively managing costs capital spending and working capital to further strengthen our liquidity 

however certain direct and indirect adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic persisted throughout 2021 and are expected to continue into 2022 including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage as a result due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the ultimate impacts of the covid19 pandemic and resulting potential future governmental actions and economic impacts it is possible that these adverse impacts could reoccur resulting in further adverse impacts on our future operating earnings and cash flows 

despite our ongoing efforts to minimize the pandemic’s direct and indirect adverse impacts we are unable to predict the ultimate impact to our business due to a number of evolving factors including the duration and spread of the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and our supply chain consumer demand and vehicle production schedules and the actions of governmental authorities across the globe we will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of covid19 and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business 

global supply chain disruptions due to various factors that are beyond our control there are currently global supply chain disruptions including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage the semiconductor supply shortage due in part to increased demand across multiple industries is impacting production in automotive and other industries we anticipate these supply chain disruptions will persist throughout 2022 we along with most automotive component manufacturers that use semiconductors have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of oems because of events which are outside our control including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic the global semiconductor shortage fires in our suppliers’ facilities unprecedented weather events in the southwestern united states and other extraordinary events although we are working closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at least some responsibility for their lost production and other costs while no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these customer expectations or any other future claims we do not currently believe a loss is probable we will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of these supply chain disruptions and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business 

in addition we are carrying critical inventory items and key components and we continue to procure productive raw material and noncritical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers’ vehicle production schedules however as a 

result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations our balance of productive raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of december 31 2021 we will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital 

economic conditions  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions global automotive vehicle production increased 2 flat on an aptiv weighted market basis which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the company generates its revenue “awm” from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the impacts of the global supply chain disruptions including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage which followed the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 due to the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic although 2021 global vehicle sales and production rates increased slightly they were still significantly below historic levels compared to the unusually low 2020 production rates vehicle production in 2021 increased by 2 in china 1 in north america and 18 in south america our smallest region and decreased by 4 in europe refer to note 22 segment reporting of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for financial information concerning principal geographic areas 

economic volatility or weakness in north america europe china or south america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the us and other economies and specifically the automotive sector in particular changes to international trade agreements such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our oem customers resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 

key growth markets  there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example automotive production in china experienced minimal growth of 2 in 2021 primarily due to the adverse impacts of the global supply chain disruptions impacting the industry and trade uncertainties which follows a decrease of 3 in the region in 2020 despite this lack of significant growth and the moderation in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the longterm our strong global presence and presence in these markets has positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the longterm we continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets positioning us to benefit from the expected longterm growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets 

we have a strong local presence in china including a major manufacturing base and wellestablished customer relationships each of our business segments have operations and sales in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in china and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china as have recently been experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic however we continue to believe this market will benefit from longterm demand for new vehicles and stringent governmental regulation driving increased vehicle content including accelerated demand for electrified vehicles 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety electrification high speed data connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies we are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor 

consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with key growth market oems this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions 

our operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally including unexpected changes in laws or regulations governing trade or other monetary or tax fiscal policy changes including tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions or trade barriers we are also subject to risks associated with actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business operations trade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness for instance the worldwide spread of the covid19 pandemic and variants thereof in 2020 throughout 2021 and into 2022 has had various direct and indirect adverse impacts on our global operations the automotive industry and economies around the world most notably in 2020 the pandemic resulted in extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america although certain of the adverse impacts of the pandemic abated during the second half of 2020 other direct and indirect adverse impacts continued throughout 2021 and into 2022 such as the overall supply chain disruptions and the global semiconductor supply shortage these impacts continue to negatively affect the global economy and automotive industry and we anticipate they will persist throughout 2022 as a result we are unable to predict the ultimate impact to our business due to a number of evolving factors including the duration and spread of the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on economic activity our supply chain consumer demand and vehicle production schedules and the actions of governmental authorities across the globe 

in addition existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results furthermore management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify quantify and assess threatened duties taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results if enacted 

product development  the automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have us well positioned to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for hightechnology content in automobiles 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design and development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of approximately 18900 scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 12 major technical centers in china germany india mexico poland singapore and the united states our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 14 billion 13 billion and 15 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively which includes approximately 320 million 303 million and 381 million of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 30 of engineering expenses we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate 

extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who coinvested approximately 320 million in 2021 to support new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2022 

we maintain a large portfolio of approximately 8500 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of december 31 2021 while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions in addition during 2021 global economies as well as our industry were subjected to significant inflationary cost pressures and these pressures are expected to continue into 2022 we continue to work with our customers both through price recoveries and adjustments as well as future pricing adjustments as contracts renew to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures on our results of operations 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 97 of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of contingent workers which represented approximately 22 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2021 however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing our global overhead costs as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2021 results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 41 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately 56 billion of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility and committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2021 and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits liabilities as further described in note 15 shareholders’ and net income per share to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we also issued 23 billion total of preferred and ordinary shares during 2020 we intend to maintain strong financial discipline by targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and 

regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation and disruptive new entrants  consolidation among worldwide oems and suppliers is expected to continue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships additionally the rise of advanced software and technologies in vehicles has attracted new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry these entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance which could adversely affect the future growth of the company we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of these trends 

consolidated results of operations 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2021 were 156 billion an increase of approximately 20 compared to 2020 our overall volumes increased 16 despite total global oem production increases of only 2 flat on an awm basis for the year ended december 31 2021 from the unusually low 2020 production rates and despite the ongoing direct and indirect adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic and worldwide semiconductor shortage on vehicle production schedules and sales volumes our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were adversely impacted by the governmental “lockdown” orders due to the covid19 pandemic for all nonessential activities initially in china during the first quarter of 2020 and subsequently in europe and north america despite the volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions throughout 2021 our overall lean cost structure along with continued abovemarket sales growth in all major regions has enabled us to achieve strong levels of operating income while continuing to strategically invest in the future 

aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as “fx” contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

• volume net of contractual price reductions—changes in volume offset by contractual price reductions which typically range from 1 to 3 of net sales and changes in mix 

• operational performance—changes to costs for materials and commodities or manufacturing and engineering variances and 

• other—including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included in volume net of contractual price reductions or operational performance 

the automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain for instance in 2021 the industry has been subjected to increased pricing pressures specifically in relation to copper and petroleumbased resin products which have increased significantly in price due to various factors the industry is also facing increased operating and logistics challenges from certain global supply chain disruptions including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage this shortage has resulted in increased pricing pressures on semiconductors as well we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect semiconductor supply cost and commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash 

flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

this section discusses our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2021 versus 2020 a detailed discussion of our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2020 versus 2019 can be found under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the sec on february 8 2021 

2021 versus 2020 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2021 versus 2020 



total net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 20 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 despite the ongoing direct and indirect adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic on vehicle production schedules and sales volumes which include the current global supply chain disruptions impacting the automotive industry our overall volumes increased 16 for the period from the unusually low 2020 volumes our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 were adversely impacted by the governmental “lockdown” orders due to the covid19 pandemic for all nonessential activities initially in china during the first quarter of 2020 and subsequently in europe and north america our total net sales 

also reflect favorable foreign currency impacts primarily related to the euro and chinese yuan renminbi and contractual price reductions 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

cost of sales increased 2056 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 as summarized below the company’s material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



a presented net of contractual price reductions for gross margin variance 

the increase in cost of sales reflects increased volumes the impacts from currency exchange and operational performance our operational performance for the year ended december 31 2021 includes approximately 260 million of increased costs for semiconductors and commodities as well as approximately 130 million of increased costs primarily related to material logistics costs associated with the global supply chain disruptions due to the worldwide semiconductor shortage and other extraordinary events coupled with 80 million of incremental costs detailed in the bullet below in other total increased costs resulting from the global supply chain disruptions were approximately 210 million during the year ended december 31 2021 cost of sales was also impacted by the following items in other above 

• 337 million of increased commodity passthrough costs and 

• increased costs of approximately 80 million primarily for distributional logistics and other inefficiencies resulting from the global supply chain disruptions as per above partially offset by 

• decreased expense of approximately 35 million primarily due to decreased engineering expenses as a result of the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai in march 2020 which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting and 

• 21 million of decreased warranty costs 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs sga decreased as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increased sales in 2021 partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs 

amortization 



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets the consistency in amortization during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflects the continued amortization of our definitelived intangible assets which resulted primarily from our acquisitions over their estimated useful lives refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of our business acquisitions including details of the intangible assets recorded in each transaction 

in 2022 we expect to incur noncash amortization charges of approximately 149 million excluding any noncash amortization charges incurred as a result of the proposed acquisition of wind river which is expected to close in mid2022 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 

restructuring 



the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges totaling approximately 24 million during the year ended december 31 2021 we expect to make cash payments of approximately 40 million in 2022 pursuant to currently implemented restructuring programs 

restructuring charges recorded during 2020 were primarily focused on aligning our production capabilities with the reduced levels of global vehicle production resulting from the covid19 pandemic as well as the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 136 million during the year ended december 31 2020 of which 62 million was recognized for programs implemented in the north america region and 57 million was recognized for programs implemented in the european region pursuant to the company’s ongoing overhead cost reduction strategy the charges recorded during 2020 included the recognition of approximately 90 million of employeerelated and other costs related to actions taken as a result of the global impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

we expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2022 and beyond primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs which includes approximately 15 million which primarily relate to the signal and power solutions segment for programs approved as of december 31 2021 additionally as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint the company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future if necessary in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions customer actions and other factors

income taxes 



the company’s tax rate is affected by the fact that its parent entity is an irish resident taxpayer the tax rates in ireland and other jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance the company’s effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate 

the company’s effective tax rate was 11 and 3 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2021 was impacted by favorable provision to return adjustments as well as releases of valuation allowances as a result of the company’s determination that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized the company also accrued 19 million of reserve adjustments for uncertain tax positions 

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 was impacted by changes in reserves provision to return adjustments changes in valuation allowances and the tax impact of certain intragroup reorganizations meant to streamline and simplify the company’s operating and legal structure which resulted in the recognition of losses for tax purposes the effective tax rate was also impacted by the beneficial impact from the gain on the autonomous driving joint venture the tax expense associated with the gain was insignificant as aptiv’s aggregate autonomous driving assets were exempt from capital gains tax in the jurisdiction from which they were sold the aggregate autonomous driving assets had been acquired purchased or developed in taxable transactions in prior periods and reflect changes made to the corporate entity operating structure for intellectual property following the separation of its former powertrain systems segment

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements and operational restructuring activities and dividends on our outstanding preferred shares our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary and available borrowings under credit facilities and issuance of longterm debt and equity to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions or investments andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 31 billion and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 09 billion we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 20 billion revolving credit facility and the committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as described below the following table summarizes our available liquidity which includes cash cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities as of december 31 2021 the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s significant committed credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants which are described below 



1 availability reduced by less than 1 million in letters of credit issued under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 

2 based on december 31 2021 foreign currency rates subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable 

despite the current global economic impacts and uncertainties resulting from the ongoing global supply chain disruptions the covid19 pandemic and the resulting direct and indirect impacts on global vehicle production we currently expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on preferred shares and capital expenditures furthermore we expect to acquire wind river and pay other required fees and expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition utilizing a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from new indebtedness and we expect to be able to acquire such additional indebtedness on terms acceptable to us 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and the terms of the credit agreement we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to aptiv as of december 31 2021 the company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled approximately 31 billion if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from nonus subsidiaries to the us however based on our current liquidity needs and strategies we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2022 and beyond

we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan structures and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs we utilize a global cash pooling arrangement to consolidate and manage our global cash balances which enables us to efficiently move cash into and out of a number of the countries in which we operate 

operating activities —net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1222 million and 1413 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 consisted primarily of net earnings of 609 million increased by 938 million for noncash charges for depreciation amortization pension costs and extinguishment of debt partially offset by 567 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities net of restructuring and pension contributions cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 consisted primarily of net earnings of 1822 million increased by 802 million for noncash charges for depreciation amortization and pension costs partially offset by 1434 million for the noncash gain resulting from the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture and 107 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities net of restructuring and pension contributions 

investing activities —net cash used in investing activities totaled 729 million and 626 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in usage is primarily attributable to 132 million paid for business acquisitions and technology investments as compared to 51 million during the year ended december 31 2020 additionally capital expenditures increased 27 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

financing activities —net cash used in financing activities totaled 191 million for the year ended december 31 2021 and net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1613 million for the year ended december 31 2020 cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily included net proceeds of 1450 million received from the issuance of the 2021 senior notes which were utilized to redeem the 700 million 2014 senior notes and 650 million 425 senior notes partially offset by 63 million of mcps dividend payments cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily included 1115 million and 1115 million in net proceeds from the public offering of ordinary and preferred shares net of issuance costs respectively partially offset by 372 million in repayments under other shortterm debt agreements 88 million of dividend payments and 57 million paid to repurchase ordinary shares 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not engage in any offbalance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty which is further exacerbated by the unknown future duration and severity of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing global supply chain disruptions these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

acquisitions and other transactions 

in accordance with the accounting guidance in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to 

the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill the process to estimate fair value described herein is generally applicable to other transactions including the fair value estimates used in establishing the identifiable assets liabilities and goodwill recorded upon formation of motional aptiv’s autonomous driving joint venture and the resulting equity method investment recorded on aptiv’s balance sheet 

an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations and product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s or moody’s 

aptiv does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary the primary funded nonus plans are in the uk and mexico for the determination of 2021 expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 375 and 750 for the uk and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the uk and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of our plan assets is actual fair value 

our pension expense for 2022 is determined at the december 31 2021 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets including our investments in affiliates the most significant of which is our investment in motional inc for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 test discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the company’s share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an entity must record an impairment charge based on the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired similar to the goodwill assessment described above the company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if necessary the company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset based upon its forecasted cash flows to its carrying value other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2021 are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate “transactional exposure” we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the company’s reporting currency “translational exposure” the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 2021 the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 143 million was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 8 in relation to the euro from december 31 2020 

as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in order to manage certain translational exposure we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes and the 2016 eurodenominated senior notes as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries we have also entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain chinese yuan renminbidenominated subsidiaries the effective portion of the gains or losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment component in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in these foreign currencydenominated operations 

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty euro and hungarian forint as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the net fair value liability of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 876 million and 767 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 34 million and 25 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the potential gain in fair value from a hypothetical 10 favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 43 million and 31 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value liability due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper the net fair value of our contracts was an asset of 34 million and 35 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 36 million and 22 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively a 10 change in the net fair value asset differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 313 million of floating rate debt related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 0125 per annum or b libor plus 1125 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 010 per annum or b libor plus 110 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate option over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 001 to 025 up to a maximum of 050 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings or based on whether the company achieves or fails to achieve certain sustainabilitylinked targets with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety as further discussed in note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate 

during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor future changes in our corporate credit ratings or the sustainabilitylinked targets as discussed above

the automotive technology and components industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2020 the industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules primarily due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic the adverse impacts to aptiv of the pandemic which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020 included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america in the second quarter adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic from the first half of 2020 were partially offset by increased consumer demand and vehicle production schedules in the second half of 2020 particularly in the fourth quarter compared to 2019 vehicle production in 2020 decreased by 22 in europe 21 in north america 3 in china and 31 in south america our smallest region demand for automotive components in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers electric vehicle developers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement we aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation outside the us regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united kingdom china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy with the us expected to introduce new regulations in the near future in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2021 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide “co 2 ” emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are challenged to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions we are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms we are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce co 2 emissions and increase fuel economy making the world greener 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents we are pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles we also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as overtheair ota technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect marketrelevant data from connected vehicles 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

convergence of safe green and connected solutions in new mobility and autonomous driving 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co 2 emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements 

we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies 

in an effort to further our leadership position in the automated driving space in march 2020 we completed the transaction with hyundai motor group “hyundai” to form a new joint venture focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies the joint venture operates globally under the motional brand name and brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest oems we expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of productionready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space 

we believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe reliable and accessible reality furthermore we anticipate motional’s presence in both north america and asia along with the global presence of both aptiv and hyundai to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements 

the motional joint venture began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and anticipates it will have a productionready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers fleet operators and automotive manufacturers to test at prototype scale in 2022 with higher volumes available for deployment in 2023 in addition motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston and singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the safe green and connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems select suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation

competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in best cost countries such as china and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving and mobility solutions which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2020 



1 on january 16 2021 fca and psa executed a merger agreement to form a new combined company “stellantis” on a combined basis the formerly separate companies accounted for 12 of aptiv’s net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 

supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally one of our largest customers gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2020 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our signal and power solutions segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 151000 people 24000 salaried employees and 127000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 33000 contract and temporary workers certain of our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the international union of electronic electrical salaried machine and furniture workers  communications workers of america and the confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos 

retention and talent development 

our employees are united across the globe in pursuit of our mission of developing safer greener and more connected solutions enabling the future of mobility the retention of highly qualified and diverse talent is critical to this mission aptiv’s continued growth and effective succession planning as part of our focus on the retention of employees we believe in being strategic and intentional in our efforts to provide talented and diverse individuals an opportunity to leverage their demonstrated performance and to gain sustainable leadership qualities aligned to our mission culture and values we have developed robust succession plans for our top leadership these plans align with our development initiatives such as advancing diversity candidates in leadership and in engineering and manufacturing functions furthermore we recognize the importance of mentorship and the part it plays in personal and professional growth 

aptiv is committed to talent development and growing the next generation of leaders we have established a process of recurring talent reviews focused on development and execution of specific development action plans in addition we offer several development programs targeting various career development needs our leadership development program provides a holistic approach that develops business acumen and personal competencies as well as the opportunity to learn and interact with peers from around the world our leadership foundations program is designed to help newly hired or promoted managers understand the aptiv way of leading people we also leverage aptiv academy our online learning management system across the enterprise using inperson online and virtual reality learning opportunities 

culture 

aptiv continually evaluates the culture values and behaviors we believe are core to enabling a thriving environment for our employees to establish expectations and clarity regarding the culture we are shaping as well as the behaviors we measure in our talent evaluation system several thousand of our top leaders have participated in global culture workshops led by our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief human resources officer “chro” 

diversity and inclusion 

at aptiv we value each individual’s perspective and foster a strong culture of respect and inclusive collaboration leveraging our employees’ diverse backgrounds and experiences allows us to make better decisions and supports stronger operating performance our ceo and chro review succession and talent development plans as well as diversity and inclusion with our board of directors annually aptiv also participates in and sponsors numerous outreach programs around the world which seek to promote and recruit women and diversity candidates into science technology engineering and math fields aptiv is committed to continuing to increase its level of diversity in middle management senior leadership and technology roles over the coming years 

health and safety 

furthermore we prioritize the health and safety of all our employees we routinely assess occupational health and safety risks including internal audits for all manufacturing sites assessing among other things lost workday case rates safety incident rates safety habits training and number of training hours per employee in response to the covid19 pandemic we also implemented additional safety protocols designed to make all of aptiv’s sites safer which included extensive cleaning of our facilities enhanced communications about safety protocols building capacity limits daily health screenings for onsite employees and mandatory mask use when indoors 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million 4 million and 4 million respectively we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the extent to which the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the global spread of the covid19 pandemic which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in global financial markets during 2020 we took decisive actions to enhance our financial flexibility and minimize the impact on our business such as the ramping down of certain production facilities in response to customer plant closures and changes in vehicle production schedules imposing certain travel restrictions suspending the company’s ordinary share cash dividend issuing 23 billion combined of preferred and ordinary shares extending substantially all of our existing credit agreement’s maturity to august 2022 and actively managing costs capital spending and working capital to further strengthen our liquidity despite these proactive measures the ultimate impact to our business continues to remain highly uncertain the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business will depend on a number of evolving factors including the duration and spread of the pandemic as well as the possibility of the pandemic reoccurring actions taken by governmental authorities to restrict certain business operations social activity and travel or other actions our business may also be affected by the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on economic activity and whether recessionary conditions will persist or reoccur consumer demand and vehicle production schedules the ability of our supply chain to deliver in a timely and costeffective manner the ability of our employees manufacturing and distribution facilities to operate efficiently and effectively the continued viability and financial stability of our customers and suppliers and future access to capital all of which remain uncertain 

the adverse impacts to aptiv of the pandemic which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020 included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter of 2020 in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america during the second half of 2020 many of these impacts abated resulting in increased sales and profitability from the levels observed earlier in the year however during the fourth quarter of 2020 certain european and north american countries began to initiate new governmental restrictions in response to renewed pandemic impacts and concerns and many of these restrictions have continued into the first quarter of 2021 as a result due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and resulting potential future governmental actions and economic impacts it is possible that these adverse impacts could continue to reoccur resulting in further adverse impacts on our future operating earnings and cash flows in addition to the extent the factors indicated above adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors in this section 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing the spread of an infectious disease virus or other widespread illness and more additionally as we grow in best cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we 

validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic led to a significant vehicle production slowdown in the first half of 2020 which was followed by increased consumer demand and vehicle production schedules in the second half of 2020 particularly in the fourth quarter this surge in demand led to a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage in early 2021 as semiconductor suppliers have been unable to rapidly reallocate production lines to serve the automotive industry we are currently assessing the potential supply chain impacts of this worldwide shortage which may directly or indirectly impact various automotive suppliers and correspondingly oem production we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts and we continue to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise due to this or any other issue however any direct or indirect supply chain disruptions may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors including global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the automotive industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules in 2020 primarily due to the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic compared to 2019 vehicle production in 2020 decreased by 22 in europe 21 in north america 3 in china and 31 in south america our smallest region as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in certain regions uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical reduced consumer demand patterns and industry consolidation when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our revenues and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems’ vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers which can be affected by industry consolidation also impacts our sales for example in january 2021 fca and psa executed a merger agreement to form a new combined company “stellantis” which will represent the world’s fourth largest oem the merger may result in the discontinuation of certain major vehicle brands previously marketed under the separate companies which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth 

the global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies which have attracted new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future 

in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

we have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key geographic market and have identified advanced driver assistance systems autonomous driving technologies mobility solutions and high voltage 

electrification systems as key product markets we believe these markets are likely to experience substantial longterm growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the asia pacific region or if we are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues for example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to evolving guidance issued by the us department of transportation “dot” regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of these systems including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads there remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the dot or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction it is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs 

we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in developing marketrelevant products depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies in particular the recent formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai is dependent on the success of our relationship with our joint venture partner there are certain risks involved in such relationships as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations may be acquired by other companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement may compete with us may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional 

resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs which could adversely affect our business and operational results 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 39 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 accordingly our revenues may be adversely affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share for instance certain united automobile workers “uaw” represented employees at gm initiated a labor strike in september 2019 lasting approximately six weeks in duration as gm is one of our largest customers this labor strike adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 in addition because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive technology and components market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the longterm we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example automotive production in china decreased by 3 in 2020 primarily due to the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic and foreign trade uncertainties which follows a decrease of 9 in the region in 2019 our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china continue to decrease our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to three percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products for example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and costcutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of 

products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our thirdparty suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 73 million as of december 31 2020 the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to these nonus defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 539 million at december 31 2020 of which 21 million is included in accrued liabilities 519 million is included in longterm liabilities and 1 million is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring actions will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facility’s building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s value is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not met the company then performs a quantitative assessment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company recognizes an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit it is possible that we could incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability for instance certain uaw represented employees at gm initiated a labor strike in september 2019 lasting approximately six weeks in duration as gm is one of our largest customers this labor strike adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant 

increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 66 of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 came from sales outside the us which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro and chinese yuan renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in various national and local jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 66 of our net revenue came from sales outside the us international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 

• exposure to local economic political and labor conditions 

• unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or fiscal policy including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the us and other foreign countries 

• tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers 

• expropriation and nationalization 

• difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems 

• reduced technology data or intellectual property protections 

• limitations on repatriation of earnings 

• withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries 

• investment restrictions or requirements 

• violence and civil unrest in local countries and 

• compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable antibribery laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws of various other countries 

additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities complications due to natural nuclear or other disasters or the spread of an infectious disease virus or other widespread illness for instance the global spread of covid19 which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 caused certain governmental authorities worldwide to initiate “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities which at times has included extended shutdowns of businesses in the impacted regions in addition government changes in mexico have yielded requirements for increases in minimum wages throughout the country these or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in mexico china or 

other countries in which we operate could result in social economic and labor instability these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results for instance beginning in 2018 the us and chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products most notably with respect to the automotive industry the us imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel aluminum and automotive components and china imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of us vehicles and certain automotive components despite recent trade negotiations between the us and chinese governments given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the us china or other countries we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our longterm strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

the united kingdom’s exit from the european union may adversely affect our business and profitability 

the united kingdom “uk” and europe agreed to terms for the uk’s exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” on december 24 2020 and became effective on december 31 2020 under these terms the uk and eu will continue to be able to trade on a tarifffree basis though companies will be required to file customs and duty declarations for the cross border movement of goods similar in nature to other border crossings these compliance requirements will be effective beginning in early 2021 and may take several months to complete during the implementation phase our cross border shipments between the uk and eu and those of our customers and suppliers may be subject to delays and restrictions which may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions potential adverse impacts of this phase may include reduced vehicle production reduced global market liquidity and restrictions on the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets which could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we do not have a material physical presence in the uk with less than 1 of our workforce located in the uk and approximately 2 of our annual net sales generated in the uk the potential impacts of brexit could adversely impact other global economies and in particular the european economy a region which accounted for approximately 34 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize the impacts on our business through review of our existing contractual arrangements and obligations particularly in the european region any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years most recently the acquisition of dynawave inc and we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruptions to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business such as disruptions caused by cyberattacks could adversely impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology systems and facilities both internally and externally we rely on these systems to among other things make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to record and process transactions billings payments inventory and other data in many currencies on a daily basis and across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers also contain sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyberattacks and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged or go undetected cyberattacks both domestically and abroad are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect although we have and continue to take precautions to prevent detect and mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology systems or facilities could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively and could result in significant costs fines or litigation an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally certain of our products contain complex information technology systems designed to support today’s increasingly connected vehicles and could be susceptible to similar interruptions including the possibility of unauthorized access further as we transition to offering more cloudbased solutions which are dependent on the internet or other networks to operate we may increasingly be the target of cyber threats including computer viruses or breaches due to misconduct of employees contractors or others who have access to our networks and systems or those of third parties with which we do business although we have designed and implemented security measures to prevent and detect such unauthorized access or cyber threats from occurring there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our security efforts will be successful any unauthorized access to our components could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results further maintaining and updating these systems may require significant costs and often involves implementation integration and security risks including risks that we may not adequately anticipate the market or technological trends or that we may experience unexpected challenges that could cause financial reputational and operational harm however failing to properly respond to and invest in information technology advancements may limit our ability to attract and retain customers prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors or inhibit our ability to meet regulatory or other requirements 

to date we have not experienced a system failure cyberattack or security breach that has resulted in a material interruption in our operations or material adverse effect on our financial condition our board of directors regularly reviews relevant information technology and cyber security matters and receives periodic updates from information technology and cyber security subject matter experts as part of its risk assessment procedures including analysis of existing and emerging risks as well as plans and strategies to address those risks while we continuously seek to expand and improve our information technology systems and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

• lose net revenue 

• incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support 

• experience delays cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products 

• experience increased product returns or discounts or 

• damage our reputation 

all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

• the generation storage handling use transportation presence of or exposure to hazardous materials 

• the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water 

• the incorporation of certain chemical substances into our products including electronic equipment and 

• the health and safety of our employees 

we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to thirdparty disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million at december 31 2020 for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot ensure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial 

condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2020 the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2020 claims totaling approximately 105 million using december 31 2020 foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2020 we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 20 million using december 31 2020 foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and trade names and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased existing income tax laws regulations and related international agreements provide guidance and direction on the allocations of income and applicable taxing rights among the countries in which we operate changes in these guidelines are being contemplated at the local national regional particularly in the eu and global levels through organizations like the g20 and the organisation for economic cooperation and development any changes especially if made inconsistently could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws additionally in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

general risk factors 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

brazil matters 

aptiv conducts business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while aptiv believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2020 the majority of claims asserted against 

aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2020 claims totaling approximately  105 million using december 31 2020 foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2020 the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of  20 million using december 31 2020 foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and aptiv’s results of operations could be materially affected the company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero to  85 million

◦ leveraging opportunistic market pricing dynamics and strong market demand by issuing 115 billion of ordinary shares and 115 billion of 550 preferred shares and 

◦ extending the maturity of substantially all of our existing credit agreement to august 2022 

• acting decisively in response to the global pandemic 

◦ taking early and decisive actions to preserve our financial strength including temporarily reducing executive pay reducing capital expenditures and suspending share repurchases and ordinary share dividends and 

◦ designing and successfully implementing our safe operations protocols which enabled our facilities to restart safely and operate with zero production disruptions following the restart 

• generating strong results despite the pandemic 

◦ delivering sustained outperformance with abovemarket sales growth of 10 attributable to our portfolio of leading technologies aligned with secular growth drivers and 

◦ generating 2118 million of operating income or 867 million of adjusted operating income and cash flow from operations of 14 billion despite the pandemic’s negative impact on automotive production and 

◦ achieving 4964 total shareholder return over the period 2018 through 2020 illustrating our investors’ belief in our longterm strategy and current financial performance 

• continuing our relentless focus on cost structure and operational optimizatio n 

◦ maximizing our operational flexibility and profitability at all points in the normal automotive business cycle by having approximately 97 of our hourly workforce based in best cost countries and approximately 20 of our hourly workforce composed of temporary employees and 

◦ recruiting and retaining top talent from various industries including technology 

• continuing to execute on our longterm safe green and connected strategy to enable a more sustainable future 

◦ furthering our leadership position in automated driving through the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai which is focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies and 

◦ expanding our market relevant portfolio to address the industry’s top challenges including high voltage electrification and active safety technologies and 

◦ significantly enhancing our commitment to corporate sustainability  

our strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative marketrelevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous forwardlooking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to our customers we are committed to creating value for our shareholders our key strategic priorities include 

commercializing the hightech evolution of the automotive industry  the automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of softwaredependent components and solutions in particular the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space we are focused on enabling and delivering endtoend smart mobility solutions accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services our advanced safety and user experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms and our signal and power solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in today’s complex vehicles together our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment 

we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies 

in an effort to further our leadership position in the automated driving space in march 2020 we completed the transaction with hyundai to form a new joint venture focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies the joint venture operates globally under the motional brand name and brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest oems we expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of productionready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space 

we believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe reliable and accessible reality furthermore we anticipate motional’s presence in both north america and asia along with the global presence of both aptiv and hyundai to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements 

the motional joint venture began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and anticipates it will have a productionready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers fleet operators and automotive manufacturers to test at prototype scale in 2022 with higher volumes available for deployment in 2023 in addition motional is involved in collaborative 

arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston and singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

however there are many risks associated with these evolving areas including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and new and emerging regulations such as the recently released federal guidance for automated driving systems published by the us department of transportation while we believe we are wellpositioned in these markets the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines 

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 12 major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  in order to maintain our strong liquidity position in the midst of the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic we completed only one acquisition in 2020 we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses while continuing to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

covid19 pandemic the global spread of covid19 which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in global financial markets most notably with respect to the automotive industry we experienced extended work stoppages in china during the first quarter of 2020 where we have a major manufacturing base and the subsequent suspension of vehicle production by our oem customers in north america and europe which combined accounted for 69 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 as the pandemic spread to those regions and governmental authorities initiated “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities the work stoppages began to abate in china in march and north america and europe oem production restarted sporadically in the second quarter however the risk of renewed government “lockdown” orders resulting in further work stoppages remains although we have taken decisive actions to enhance our financial flexibility and minimize the impact on our business such as the ramping down of certain production facilities in response to customer plant closures and changes in vehicle production schedules imposing certain travel restrictions suspending our ordinary share cash dividend issuing 23 billion combined of preferred and ordinary shares 

extending substantially all of our existing credit agreement’s maturity to august 2022 and actively managing costs capital spending and working capital to further strengthen our liquidity the ultimate impact to our business continues to remain uncertain during the year ended december 31 2020 our net sales were adversely impacted by volume decreases of approximately 7 primarily due to the impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic which included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other resultant adverse global economic impacts 

for example the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic led to a significant vehicle production slowdown in the first half of 2020 which was followed by increased consumer demand and vehicle production schedules in the second half of 2020 particularly in the fourth quarter this surge in demand led to a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage in early 2021 as semiconductor suppliers have been unable to rapidly reallocate production lines to serve the automotive industry we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts and we continue to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise due to this or any other issue however any direct or indirect supply chain disruptions may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we continue to actively monitor the potential supply chain impacts of this worldwide shortage and other ongoing potential impacts of covid19 and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize its impact on our business 

economic conditions  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions global automotive vehicle production decreased 16 19 on an aptiv weighted market basis which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the company generates its revenue “awm” from 2019 to 2020 representing automotive vehicle production declines across all major regions during the year primarily due to the adverse global economic impacts and uncertainty caused by the worldwide spread of the covid19 pandemic compared to 2019 vehicle production in 2020 decreased by 22 in europe 21 in north america 3 in china and 31 in south america our smallest region refer to note 22 segment reporting of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for financial information concerning principal geographic areas 

economic volatility or weakness in north america europe china or south america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the us and other economies and specifically the automotive sector in particular changes to international trade agreements such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our oem customers resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the uk and europe as a result of the uk’s exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the terms of which were determined on december 24 2020 and became effective on december 31 2020 under these terms the uk and eu will continue to be able to trade on a tarifffree basis though companies will be required to file customs and duty declarations for the cross border movement of goods similar in nature to other border crossings these compliance requirements will be effective beginning in early 2021 and may take several months to complete during the implementation phase our cross border shipments between the uk and eu and those of our customers and suppliers may be subject to delays and restrictions which may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions potential adverse impacts of this phase may include reduced vehicle production reduced global market liquidity and restrictions on the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets which could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we do not have a material physical presence in the uk with less than 1 of our workforce located in the uk and approximately 2 of our annual net sales generated in the uk the potential impacts of brexit could adversely impact other global economies and in particular the european economy a region which accounted for approximately 34 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize the impacts on our business through review of our existing contractual arrangements and obligations particularly in the european region 

key growth markets  there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously 

experienced as evidenced by the reduction in volumes in the region during the year ended december 31 2020 production decreased 3 in china during 2020 primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic despite these vehicle production declines and the recent moderation in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the longterm our strong global presence and presence in these markets has positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the longterm we continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets positioning us to benefit from the expected longterm growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets 

we have a strong local presence in china including a major manufacturing base and wellestablished customer relationships each of our business segments have operations and sales in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in china and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china as have recently been experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic however we continue to believe this market will benefit from longterm demand for new vehicles and stringent governmental regulation driving increased vehicle content including accelerated demand for electrified vehicles 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety electrification high speed data connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies we are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions 

our global operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including unexpected changes in laws or regulations governing trade or other monetary or tax fiscal policy changes including tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions or trade barriers we are also subject to risks associated with actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business operations trade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness for instance the worldwide spread of the covid19 pandemic has had adverse impacts on our global operations the automotive industry and economies around the world most notably the pandemic has resulted in extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america although many of the adverse impacts of the pandemic abated during the second half of 2020 we are unable to predict the ultimate impact to our business due to a number of evolving factors including the duration and spread of the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on economic activity consumer demand and vehicle production schedules and the actions of governmental authorities across the globe furthermore in the fourth quarter of 2020 certain european and north american countries began to initiate new governmental restrictions in response to renewed pandemic impacts and concerns many of these restrictions have continued into the first quarter of 2021 which in combination with other actions and events may adversely impact future operating earnings and cash flows these or any further political or governmental developments in response to the covid19 pandemic could result in social economic and labor instability 

in addition existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for instance beginning in 2018 the us and chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products most notably with respect to the automotive industry the us imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel aluminum and automotive components and china imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of us vehicles and certain automotive components while these tariffs could have potentially adverse economic impacts particularly with respect to the automotive industry and vehicle production levels we do not anticipate a significant impact to our operations as we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate adverse tariff impacts such as production localization and relocation contract review and renegotiation and working with the appropriate governmental agencies further our global footprint and regional model serves to minimize our exposure to crossborder transactions however despite recent trade negotiations between the us and chinese governments the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs remain uncertain 

product development  the automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally and is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have us well positioned to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for hightechnology content in automobiles 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design and development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of approximately 18200 scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 12 major technical centers in china germany india mexico poland singapore and the united states our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 13 billion 15 billion and 14 billion for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively which includes approximately 303 million 381 million and 288 million of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 15 to 20 of engineering expenses we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who coinvested approximately 303 million in 2020 to support new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 which is consistent with expenditures incurred in 2020 

we maintain a large portfolio of approximately 7700 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of december 31 2020 while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 97 of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 20 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2020 however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing our global overhead costs as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2020 results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 41 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately 52 billion of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility and committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2020 and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities as further described in note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we extended substantially all of our existing credit agreement’s maturity to august 2022 primarily to provide additional available liquidity and financial flexibility to mitigate the impacts on our business resulting from the uncertainty caused by the global spread of the covid19 pandemic furthermore as further described in note 15 shareholders’ and net income per share to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we also issued 23 billion combined of preferred and ordinary shares during the year ended december 31 2020 we intend to maintain strong financial discipline by targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide oems and suppliers is expected to continue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships for example in january 2021 fca and psa executed a merger agreement to form a new combined company “stellantis” which will represent the world’s fourth largest oem the merger may lead to the discontinuation of certain major vehicle brands previously marketed under the separate companies which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows additionally new entrants from outside the traditional automotive industry may seek to gain access to certain vehicle component markets we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

consolidated results of operations 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2020 were 131 billion a decrease of approximately 9 compared to 2019 this compares to total global oem production decreases of 16 in 2020 we experienced volume declines of 7 for the period primarily as a result of the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic on global vehicle production volume was also impacted by increased net sales of approximately 86 million as a result of the acquisition of gabocom in late 2019 despite the volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic throughout 2020 our overall lean cost structure along with continued abovemarket sales growth in all major regions has enabled us to achieve strong levels of operating income while continuing to strategically invest in the future 

aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as “fx” contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

• volume net of contractual price reductions—changes in volume offset by contractual price reductions which typically range from 1 to 3 of net sales and changes in mix 

• operational performance—changes to costs for materials and commodities or manufacturing and engineering variances and 

• other—including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included in volume net of contractual price reductions or operational performance 

the automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

this section discusses our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2020 versus 2019 a detailed discussion of our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2019 versus 2018 can be found under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the sec on february 3 2020 

2020 versus 2019 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2020 versus 2019 



total net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 9 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 our overall volumes decreased 7 for the period primarily due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which also resulted in global vehicle production declines of 16 19 on an awm basis over the same period the adverse impacts to aptiv of the pandemic which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020 included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic from the first half of 2020 were partially offset by increased consumer demand and vehicle production schedules in the second half of 2020 particularly in the fourth quarter our total net sales also reflect contractual price reductions volume declines were partially offset by increased net sales of 86 million as a result of the acquisition of gabocom in late 2019 and favorable foreign currency impacts primarily related to the euro and chinese yuan renminbi refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of our business acquisitions 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

cost of sales decreased 585 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 as summarized below the company’s material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



a presented net of contractual price reductions for gross margin variance 

the decrease in cost of sales reflects decreased volumes largely resulting from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and impacts from currency exchange and operational performance however as certain of our costs remain fixed in nature over the near term our gross margin as a percentage of sales was adversely impacted compared to the prior year period primarily due to the covid19 pandemic cost of sales was also impacted by the following items in other above 

• decreased expense of approximately 135 million primarily due to decreased engineering expenses as a result of the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai in march 2020 which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting and 

• 16 million of decreased commodity passthrough costs partially offset by 

• approximately 40 million of costs related to supply chain inefficiencies primarily due to the worldwide semiconductor microchip shortage and the increase in vehicle production schedules in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 

• 47 million of increased depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of a higher fixed asset base and 

• 33 million of increased warranty costs 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs sga as a percentage of net sales was flat for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 and was primarily impacted by decreased sga expenses as a result of the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting partially offset by increased sga expenses due to our business acquisitions 

amortization 



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets the decrease in amortization during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflects 8 million of intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the year ended december 31 2019 partially offset by the continued amortization of our definitelived intangible assets which resulted primarily from our acquisitions over their estimated useful lives refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of our business acquisitions including details of the intangible assets recorded in each transaction 

in 2021 we expect to incur noncash amortization charges of approximately 151 million 

restructuring 



the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges totaling approximately 136 million during the year ended december 31 2020 of which 62 million was recognized for programs implemented in the north american region and 57 million was recognized for programs implemented in the european region the charges recorded during 2020 included the recognition of approximately 90 million of employeerelated and other costs related to actions taken as a result of the global impacts of the covid19 pandemic we expect to make cash payments of approximately 80 million in 2021 pursuant to currently implemented restructuring programs 

restructuring charges recorded during 2019 were primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 148 million during the year ended december 31 2019 of which 74 million was recognized for programs implemented in the european region pursuant to the company’s ongoing overhead cost reduction strategy 

we expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2021 and beyond primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs which includes approximately 45 million of which approximately 20 million relates to the signal and power solutions segment and approximately 25 million relates to the advanced safety and user experience segment for programs approved as of december 31 2020 additionally as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint the company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future if necessary in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions customer actions and other factors

income taxes 



the company’s tax rate is affected by the fact that its parent entity is an irish resident taxpayer the tax rates in ireland and other jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance the company’s effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate 

the company’s effective tax rate was 3 and 12 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2020 was impacted by changes in reserves provision to return adjustments changes in valuation allowances and the tax impact of certain intragroup reorganizations meant to streamline and simplify the company’s operating and legal structure which resulted in the recognition of losses for tax purposes the effective tax rate was also impacted by the beneficial impact from the gain on the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture the 

tax expense associated with the gain was insignificant as aptiv’s aggregate autonomous driving assets were exempt from capital gains tax in the jurisdiction from which they were sold the aggregate autonomous driving assets had been acquired purchased or developed in taxable transactions in prior periods and reflect changes made to the corporate entity operating structure for intellectual property following the separation of its former powertrain systems segment 

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was impacted by releases of valuation allowances as a result of the company’s determination that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized as well as favorable provision to return adjustments the company also accrued 20 million of reserve adjustments for uncertain tax positions which included reserves for ongoing audits in foreign jurisdictions as well as for changes in estimates based on relevant new or additional evidence obtained related to certain of the company’s tax positions including tax authority administrative pronouncements and court decisions 

refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

equity income 



equity loss income net of tax reflects the company’s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equity method investments the equity loss net of tax recognized by aptiv during the year ended december 31 2020 includes 98 million attributable to the motional autonomous driving joint venture formed in march 2020 with hyundai as further described in note 5 investments in affiliates and note 24 held for sale to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

results of operations by segment 

we operate our core business along the following operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

• signal and power solutions which includes complete electrical architecture and component products 

• advanced safety and user experience which includes component and systems integration expertise in advanced safety user experience and connectivity and security solutions as well as advanced software development and autonomous driving technologies 

• eliminations and other which includes i the elimination of intersegment transactions and ii certain other expenses and income of a nonoperating or strategic nature 

our management utilizes segment adjusted operating income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss to evaluate segment performance and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to the segments as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments segment adjusted operating income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to aptiv which is the most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted operating income that is prepared in accordance with us gaap segment adjusted operating income as determined and measured by aptiv should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income includes as applicable restructuring other acquisition and portfolio project costs which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions including business and product acquisitions and divestitures asset impairments gains losses on business divestitures and other transactions and deferred compensation related to acquisitions the reconciliations of adjusted operating income to net income attributable to aptiv for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are as follows

gross margin as a percentage of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to year ended december 31 2019 decreased primarily due to the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

adjusted operating income by segment 



as noted in the table above adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was impacted by volume and contractual price reductions including product mix and the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic the adverse impacts to aptiv of the pandemic which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020 included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all nonessential activities initially in the first quarter in china and subsequently in europe north america and south america adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic from the first half of 2020 were partially offset by increased consumer demand and vehicle production schedules in the second half of 2020 particularly in the fourth quarter adjusted operating income was also impacted by operational performance and the following items included within other in the table above 

• decreased expense of approximately 135 million primarily due to decreased engineering expenses as a result of the formation of the motional autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai in march 2020 which is now accounted for under the equity method of accounting and 

• 65 million of decreased sga expense not including the impact of other acquisition and portfolio project costs primarily as a result of decreased incentive compensation costs partially offset by 

• approximately 40 million of costs related to supply chain inefficiencies primarily due to the worldwide semiconductor microchip shortage and the increase in vehicle production schedules in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 

• 48 million of increased depreciation and amortization not including the impact of asset impairments primarily as a result of a higher fixed asset base and 

• 33 million of increased warranty costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

covid19 pandemic 

due to the unprecedented uncertainty related to the impact the covid19 pandemic is having on the global automotive industry and economies around the world the company initiated a series of precautionary actions during 2020 to further enhance its liquidity and financial flexibility among these the company has taken decisive actions to manage costs capital spending and working capital to further strengthen its liquidity including the ramping down of certain production facilities in response to customer plant closures and changes in vehicle production schedules additionally as further described below the company issued 23 billion combined of preferred and ordinary shares extended substantially all of our existing credit agreement’s maturity to august 2022 and suspended the payment of its ordinary share cash dividend to further increase capital preservation during the pandemic the adverse impacts of covid19 which primarily affected the company in the first half of 2020 included reduced consumer demand and supply chain interruptions which have adversely impacted global vehicle production and the viability and financial stability of the company’s customers and suppliers while the company believes it has taken prudent actions to mitigate the impacts on its business resulting from the covid19 pandemic and to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments the ultimate impact of the pandemic to the company’s business remains highly uncertain the company will continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of covid19 and will continue to seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize its impact on our business 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary and available borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of longterm debt and equity to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions or investments andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 28 billion and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 13 billion we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 20 billion revolving credit facility and the committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as described below 

the following table summarizes our available liquidity which includes cash cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities as of december 31 2020 the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s significant committed credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants which are described below 



1 availability reduced by less than 1 million in letters of credit issued under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 

2 based on december 31 2020 foreign currency rates subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable as further described below during the year ended december 31 2020 aptiv entered into a new accounts receivable factoring facility under which €450 million is available on a committed basis and will allow for factoring of receivables denominated in both euros and us dollars this facility became effective on january 1 2021 accordingly it is not included in the table above 

despite the current global economic impacts and uncertainty resulting from the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on global vehicle production as further described above we currently expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on preferred shares and capital expenditures 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and the terms of the credit agreement we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to aptiv as of december 31 2020 the company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled approximately 28 billion if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from nonus subsidiaries to the us however based on our current liquidity needs and strategies we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2021 and beyond

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time and we therefore cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty which is further exacerbated by the unknown future duration and severity of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

acquisitions and other transactions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill the process to estimate fair value described herein is generally applicable to other transactions including the fair value estimates used in establishing the identifiable assets liabilities and goodwill recorded upon formation of motional aptiv’s autonomous driving joint venture and the resulting equity method investment recorded on aptiv’s balance sheet 

an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations and product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make 

modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s or moody’s 

aptiv does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2020 2019 or 2018 the primary funded nonus plans are in the uk and mexico for the determination of 2020 expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 425 and 750 for the uk and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the uk and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of our plan assets is actual fair value 

our pension expense for 2021 is determined at the december 31 2020 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets including our investments in affiliates the most significant of which is our investment in motional inc for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future 

cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 test discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the company’s share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an entity must record an impairment charge based on the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired similar to the goodwill assessment described above the company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if necessary the company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset based upon its forecasted cash flows to its carrying value other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our 

estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2020 are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate “transactional exposure” we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the company’s reporting currency “translational exposure” the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 2020 the foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 154 million was primarily due to the impact of a weakening us dollar which decreased approximately 10 and 7 respectively in relation to the euro and the chinese yuan renminbi from december 31 2019 

as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in order to manage certain translational exposure we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes and the 2016 eurodenominated senior notes as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries we have also entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain chinese yuan renminbidenominated subsidiaries the effective portion of the gains or losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment component in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in these foreign currencydenominated operations 

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty and euro as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value liability of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 767 million and 

1199 million respectively the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 25 million and 78 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the potential gain in fair value from a hypothetical 10 favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 31 million and 78 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper the net fair value of our contracts was an asset of 35 million and a liability of less than 1 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 22 million and 21 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 321 million of floating rate debt related to the credit agreement the credit agreement was amended on may 1 2020 and extended the maturity of 1779 million in principal amount of the revolving credit facility and 298 million in principal amount of the tranche a term loan from august 17 2021 to august 17 2022 the maturity date of the remaining portions of the revolving credit facility and tranche a term loan were not extended and will mature on august 17 2021 refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information the nonextended credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 125 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 010 per annum or b libor plus 110 per annum the extended credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 075 per annum or b libor plus 175 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 040 per annum or b libor plus 140 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 010 to 050 up to a maximum of 075 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by rapidly increasing consumer demand for new mobility solutions advanced technologies and vehicle connectivity as well as increasing government regulation related to vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into two diversified segments which enable us to develop technology solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends 



  

software and autonomous driving technologies our products increase vehicle connectivity reduce driver distraction and enhance vehicle safety 

we previously reported the results of our former powertrain systems business as a segment as described above we completed the spinoff of the powertrain systems segment into a new independent public company on december 4 2017  the assets and liabilities operating results and operating and investing cash flows for the previously reported powertrain systems segment are presented as discontinued operations separate from the company’s continuing operations for all periods presented as further described in note 25 discontinued operations and held for sale to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein our description and discussion of financial amounts within this item 1 business reflect the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 23 segment reporting to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for financial information about our business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes 23 of the 25 largest automotive oems in the world and in 2019  27 of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth our ten largest platforms in 2019 were with eight different oems in addition in 2019 our products were found in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states “us” in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 15 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have also entered into collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston and singapore as we develop solutions for the evolving nature of the mobility industry 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive technology and components industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2019 the industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2018  vehicle production in 2019 decreased by 4 in both north america and europe and also decreased by 4 in south america our smallest region additionally increased market volatility and economic uncertainty in china has resulted in decreased vehicle production of 9 in 2019  which follows a decrease of 4 in the region in 2018  demand for automotive components in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement we aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a notice issued by the us national highway traffic safety administration which updated its fivestar rating system to include automatic emergency braking systems as a recommended safety technology beginning with model year 2018 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting 

  

vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the us china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide “co 2 ” emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions we are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms we are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce co 2 emissions and increase fuel economy making the world greener 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents we are pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles we also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as overtheair ota technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect marketrelevant data from connected vehicles 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

convergence of safe green and connected solutions in new mobility and autonomous driving 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co 2 emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements 

we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain 

  

controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies additionally in 2017 we acquired nutonomy inc in order to further accelerate the commercialization of automated driving solutions the acquisition of nutonomy is the latest in a series of investments we have made to expand our position in the new mobility space including the 2015 acquisition of automated driving software developer ottomatika 

there has also been increasing societal demand for mobility on demand “mod” services such as car and ridesharing and an increasing number of traditional automotive companies have made investments in the mod space we believe the increasing societal demand for mod services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the mod space in 2018 we announced a partnership with lyft inc “lyft” by launching a fleet of autonomous vehicles in las vegas which operate on aptiv’s fullyintegrated autonomous driving platform and are available to the public on the lyft network this partnership leverages our connected services capabilities and lyft’s ridehailing experience to provide valuable insights on selfdriving fleet operations and management in addition we have entered into agreements with the singapore land transport authority and with the city of boston to develop fullyautonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure as part of automated mod pilots 

in an effort to further our leadership position in the automated driving space in september 2019 we entered into a definitive agreement with hyundai motor group “hyundai” to form a new joint venture focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 we expect this partnership to advance the development of productionready autonomous driving systems for commercialization by bringing together our innovative vehicle technologies in the new mobility space with one of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers the joint venture anticipates it will begin testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and have a productionready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers fleet operators and automotive manufacturers in 2022 as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the safe green and connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems select suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation 

products 

our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines 

signal and power solutions  this segment provides complete design manufacture and assembly of the vehicle’s electrical architecture including connectors wiring assemblies and harnesses cable management electrical centers and hybrid high voltage and safety distribution systems our products provide the critical signal distribution and computing power backbone that supports increased vehicle content and electrification reduced emissions and higher fuel economy 



  

 advanced safety and user experience  this segment provides critical components systems integration and advanced software development for vehicle safety security comfort and convenience including sensing and perception systems electronic control units multidomain controllers vehicle connectivity systems application software and autonomous driving technologies our products increase vehicle connectivity reduce driver distraction and enhance vehicle safety 

 competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in best cost countries such as china and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving and mobility solutions which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



  

customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2019  



supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally one of our largest customers gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2019  we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material 

  

specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our signal and power solutions segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 141000 people 26000 salaried employees and 115000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 22000 contract and temporary workers certain of our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the international union of electronic electrical salaried machine and furniture workers  communications workers of america “iuecwa” and the confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us certain of our employees are represented by only the iuecwa with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  4 million and 4 million  respectively we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to overall global economic conditions in 2019  the automotive industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2018  vehicle production in 2019 decreased by 9 in china 4 in north america 4 in europe and 4 in south america our smallest region as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in certain regions uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems’ vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and 

financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth 

the global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies which have attracted new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future 

in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mod services could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mod services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

we have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key geographic market and have identified advanced driver assistance systems autonomous driving technologies and mobility solutions as a key product market we believe these markets are likely to experience substantial longterm growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the asia pacific region or if we are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues for example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to evolving guidance issued by the us department of transportation “dot” regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of 

these systems including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads there remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the dot or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction it is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs 

we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in developing marketrelevant products depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies in particular our recent agreement with hyundai to form an autonomous driving joint venture is dependent on the success of our relationship with our joint venture partner there are certain risks involved in such relationships as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations may be acquired by other companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement may compete with us may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs which could adversely affect our business and operational results 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 39 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2019  accordingly our revenues may be adversely affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share for instance certain united automobile workers “uaw” represented employees at gm initiated a labor strike in september 2019 lasting approximately six weeks in duration as gm is one of our largest customers this labor strike adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019  in addition because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive technology and components market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the 

longterm we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example automotive production in china decreased by 9 in 2019  which follows a decrease of 4 in the region in 2018  primarily due to moderations in the level of economic growth and foreign trade uncertainties our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china continue to decrease our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to three percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products for example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and costcutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in best cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our thirdparty suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 76 million as of december 31 2019  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to these nonus defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 497 million at december 31 2019  of which 25 million is included in accrued liabilities 474 million is included in longterm liabilities and 2 million is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring actions will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facility’s building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s value is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not met the company then performs a quantitative assessment by first comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the 

carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot ensure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability for instance certain uaw represented employees at gm initiated a labor strike in september 2019 lasting approximately six weeks in duration as gm is one of our largest customers this labor strike adversely impacted our financial condition operating results and cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019  in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 63 of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 came from sales outside the us which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro and chinese yuan renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 63 of our net revenue came from sales outside the us international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 



 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural nuclear or other disasters for instance recent government changes in mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of mexico in addition the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from china at the beginning of 2020 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region these or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in mexico china or other countries in which we operate could result in social economic and labor instability these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and its predecessor agreement the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results for instance beginning in 2018 the us and chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products most notably with respect to the automotive industry the us imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel aluminum and automotive components and china imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of us vehicles and certain automotive components despite recent trade negotiations between the us and chinese governments given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the us china or other countries we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our longterm strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

the results of the united kingdom referendum to exit the european union may adversely affect our business and profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom “uk” and europe as a result of the uk’s exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the terms of which remain undetermined the withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions including vehicle production significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we do not have a material physical presence in the uk with less than 1 of our workforce located in the uk and approximately 2 of our annual net sales generated in the uk the potential impacts of brexit could adversely impact other global economies and in particular the european economy a region which accounted for approximately 33 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business through review of our existing contractual arrangements and obligations particularly in the european region any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years most recently the acquisitions of gabo systemtechnik gmbh and falmat inc and we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruptions to our information technology systems or facilities or those of third parties with which we do business such as disruptions caused by cyberattacks could adversely impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology systems and facilities both internally and externally we rely on these systems to among other things make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to record and process transactions billings payments inventory and other data in many currencies on a daily basis and across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers also contain sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyberattacks and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged or go undetected cyberattacks both domestically and abroad are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect although we have taken precautions to prevent detect and mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology systems or facilities could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively and could result in significant costs fines or litigation an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally certain of our products contain complex information technology systems designed to support today’s increasingly connected vehicles and could be susceptible to similar interruptions including the possibility of unauthorized access further as we transition to offering more cloudbased solutions which are dependent on the internet or other networks to operate we may increasingly be the target of cyber threats including computer viruses or breaches due to misconduct of employees contractors or others who have access to our networks and systems or those of third parties with which we do business although we have designed and implemented security measures to prevent and detect such unauthorized access or cyber threats from occurring there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our security efforts will be successful any unauthorized access to our components could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results further maintaining and updating these systems may require significant costs and often involves implementation integration and security risks including risks that we may not adequately anticipate the market or technological trends or that we may experience unexpected challenges that could cause financial reputational and operational harm however failing to properly respond to and invest in information technology advancements may limit our ability to attract and retain customers prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors or inhibit our ability to meet regulatory or other requirements 

to date we have not experienced a system failure cyberattack or security breach that has resulted in a material interruption in our operations or material adverse effect on our financial condition our board of directors regularly reviews relevant information technology and cyber security matters and receives periodic updates from information technology and cyber security subject matter experts as part of its risk assessment procedures including analysis of existing and emerging risks as well as plans and strategies to address those risks while we continuously seek to expand and improve our information technology systems and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to thirdparty disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million at december 31 2019 for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot ensure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2019  the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2019  claims totaling approximately 140 million using december 31 2019 foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2019  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 30 million using december 31 2019 foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2017 spinoff of delphi technologies could materially and adversely affect our business 

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with delphi technologies to govern the separation and the relationship between the two companies following the completion of the separation these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to future liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification 

obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between aptiv and such other parties and require aptiv to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and trade names and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws additionally in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

we have no unresolved sec staff comments to report 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2019  we owned or leased 126 major manufacturing sites and 15 major technical centers a manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased we also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world we have a presence in 44 countries the following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities 



in addition to these manufacturing sites we had 15 major technical centers eight in north america two in europe middle east and africa and five in asia pacific 

of our 126 major manufacturing sites and 15 major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 62 are primarily owned and 79 are primarily leased 

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

brazil matters 

aptiv conducts business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while aptiv believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2019  the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2019  claims totaling approximately  140 million using december 31 2019 foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2019  the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of  30 million using december 31 2019 foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and aptiv’s results of operations could be materially affected the company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero to  110 million

development to grow our product offerings which are aligned with the highgrowth industry megatrends and realigned our manufacturing footprint into an efficient lowcost regional service model focused on increasing our profit margins 

our achievements in 2019 include the following 

 our strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative marketrelevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous forwardlooking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to our customers we are committed to creating value for our shareholders we repurchased 420 million of ordinary shares in 2019  and in january 2019 announced a new share repurchase program of up to 20 billion of ordinary shares we also continued to return cash to our shareholders paying cash dividends totaling 226 million in 2019  our key strategic priorities include 

commercializing the hightech evolution of the automotive industry  the automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of softwaredependent components and solutions in particular the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space we are focused on enabling and delivering endtoend smart mobility solutions accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services our advanced safety and user experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms and our signal and power solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in today’s complex vehicles together our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment 

we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies additionally in 2017 we acquired nutonomy inc “nutonomy” in order to further accelerate the commercialization of automated driving solutions the acquisition of nutonomy is the latest in a series of investments we have made to expand our position in the new mobility space including the 2015 acquisition of automated driving software developer ottomatika 

there has also been increasing societal demand for mobility on demand “mod” services such as car and ridesharing and an increasing number of traditional automotive companies have made investments in the mod space we believe the increasing societal demand for mod services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the mod space in 2018 we announced a partnership with lyft inc “lyft” by launching a fleet of autonomous vehicles in las vegas which operate on aptiv’s fullyintegrated autonomous driving platform and are available to the public on the lyft network this partnership leverages our connected services capabilities and lyft’s ridehailing experience to provide valuable insights on selfdriving fleet operations and management in addition we have entered into agreements with the 

singapore land transport authority and with the city of boston to develop fullyautonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure as part of automated mod pilots 

in an effort to further our leadership position in the automated driving space in september 2019 we entered into a definitive agreement with hyundai to form a new joint venture focused on the design development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies we expect this partnership to advance the development of productionready autonomous driving systems for commercialization by bringing together our innovative vehicle technologies in the new mobility space with one of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers the joint venture anticipates it will begin testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and have a productionready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers fleet operators and automotive manufacturers in 2022 as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory and other approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 

however there are many risks associated with these evolving areas including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and new and emerging regulations such as the recently released federal guidance for automated driving systems published by the us department of transportation while we believe we are wellpositioned in these markets the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines 

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 15 major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  during 2019 we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

economic conditions  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions global 

automotive vehicle production decreased 6 from 2018 to 2019  representing automotive vehicle production declines across all major regions during the year compared to 2018  vehicle production in 2019 decreased by 9 in china 4 in north america 4 in europe and 4 in south america our smallest region refer to note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for financial information concerning principal geographic areas 

economic volatility or weakness in north america europe china or south america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the us and other economies and specifically the automotive sector in particular changes to international trade agreements such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and its predecessor agreement the north american free trade agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our oem customers resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom “uk” and europe as a result of the uk’s exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the terms of which remain undetermined the withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions including vehicle production significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we do not have a material physical presence in the uk with less than 1 of our workforce located in the uk and approximately 2 of our annual net sales generated in the uk the potential impacts of brexit could adversely impact other global economies and in particular the european economy a region which accounted for approximately 33 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business through review of our existing contractual arrangements and obligations particularly in the european region 

key growth markets  there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced as evidenced by the reduction in volumes in the region during the year ended december 31 2019  despite the 2019 vehicle production declines and the recent moderations in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the longterm our strong global presence and presence in these markets has positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the longterm we continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets positioning us to benefit from the expected longterm growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets 

we have a strong local presence in china including a major manufacturing base and wellestablished customer relationships each of our business segments have operations and sales in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in china and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china however we continue to believe there is longterm growth potential in this market based on increasing longterm automotive and vehicle content demand 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety electrification high speed data connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies we are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected 

infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions 

our global operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or tax fiscal policy including tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers for instance recent government changes in mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of mexico these or any further political or governmental developments in mexico or other countries in which we operate could result in social economic and labor instability in addition existing free trade laws and regulations such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and its predecessor agreement the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results for instance beginning in 2018 the us and chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products most notably with respect to the automotive industry the us imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel aluminum and automotive components and china imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of us vehicles and certain automotive components while these tariffs could have potentially adverse economic impacts particularly with respect to the automotive industry and vehicle production levels we do not anticipate a significant impact to our operations as we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate adverse tariff impacts such as production localization and relocation contract review and renegotiation and working with the appropriate governmental agencies further our global footprint and regional model serves to minimize our exposure to crossborder transactions however despite recent trade negotiations between the us and chinese governments the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs remain uncertain 

product development  the automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally and is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for hightechnology content in automobiles 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design and development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of approximately 20200 scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15 major technical centers in china germany india mexico poland singapore and the united states our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 15 billion  14 billion and 11 billion for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively which includes approximately 381 million  288 million and 204 million of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 15 to 20 of engineering expenses we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who coinvested approximately 381 million in 2019 to support new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2020  a decrease from 2019 primarily as a result of the anticipated formation of the autonomous driving joint venture with hyundai which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 

we maintain a large portfolio of approximately 7600 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of december 31 2019  while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 96 of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 15 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2019  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing our global overhead costs as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2019 results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 44 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately 24 billion of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility and committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2019  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally additionally new entrants from outside the traditional automotive industry may seek to gain access to certain vehicle component markets as evidenced by the acquisition of harman international industries incorporated by samsung electronics co ltd and the acquisition of mobileye nv by intel corporation we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

consolidated results of operations 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2019 were 144 billion  a decrease of approximately 1 compared to 2018  this compares to total global oem production decreases of 6 in 2019  we experienced volume growth of 4 for the period primarily as a result of increases in europe and asia pacific volume was also impacted by increased net sales of approximately 320 million as a result of the acquisitions of kum and winchester in mid and late2018 respectively and adverse impacts of approximately 200 million resulting from the gm labor strike our overall lean cost structure along with abovemarket sales growth in all major regions has enabled us to maintain strong levels of operating income while continuing to strategically invest in the future 

aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as “fx” contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

this section discusses our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2019 versus 2018  a detailed discussion of our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended december 31 2018 versus 2017 can be found under “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018  which was filed with the sec on february 4 2019 

2019 versus 2018 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2019 versus 2018  



total net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 1 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  we experienced volume growth of 4 for the period primarily as a result of increases in europe and asia pacific volume growth was also impacted by increased net sales of approximately 320 million as a result of the acquisitions of kum and winchester in mid and late2018 respectively and adverse impacts of approximately 200 million resulting from the gm labor strike volume growth was offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily related to the euro and chinese yuan renminbi and contractual price reductions refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further information regarding acquisitions and divestitures 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

cost of sales increased 5 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  as summarized below the company’s material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



 the increase in cost of sales reflects increased volumes and incremental investment in advanced technologies and engineering partially offset by the impacts from currency exchange and operational performance improvements the increase in cost of sales is also attributable to the following items in other above 

 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs sga increased as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018  primarily as a result of our acquisitions and increased information technology costs partially offset by cost reduction initiatives including our continued rotation to best cost manufacturing locations in europe and initiatives focused on reducing global overhead costs 

amortization 



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the period the decrease in amortization during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 reflects decreased intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 and the continued amortization of our definitelived intangible assets which resulted primarily from our acquisitions over their estimated useful lives refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of our business acquisitions including details of the intangible assets recorded in each transaction 

in 2020  we expect to incur noncash amortization charges of approximately 145 million  

restructuring 



restructuring charges recorded during 2019 were primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 148 million during the year ended december 31 2019  of which 74 million was recognized for programs implemented in the european region pursuant to the company’s ongoing overhead cost reduction strategy none of the company’s individual restructuring programs initiated during 2019 were material and there have been no changes in previously initiated programs that have resulted or are expected to result in a material change to our restructuring costs we expect to make cash payments of approximately 85 million in 2020 pursuant to currently implemented restructuring programs 

restructuring charges recorded during 2018 were primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs including realignment of the company’s organizational structure due to changes in roles and workforce resulting from the spinoff of the powertrain systems segment the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 109 million during the year ended december 31 2018  of which 64 million was recognized for programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and reducing overhead costs in the region 

we expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2020  primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and to reduce global overhead costs which includes approximately 35 million of which approximately 20 million relates to the signal and power solutions segment and approximately 15 million relates to the advanced safety and user experience segment of restructuring costs related to programs approved as of december 31 2019  additionally as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint the company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future if necessary in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions customer actions and other factors

interest expense 



the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 reflects the issuance of the 2019 senior notes in the first quarter of 2019 which were utilized to redeem the 315 senior notes and increased shortterm borrowings refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other income net 



during the year ended december 31 2019  aptiv recorded 13 million of interest income and a pretax unrealized gain of 19 million related to increases in fair value of its equity investments without readily determinable fair values as further discussed in note 5 investments in affiliates to the consolidated financial statements contained herein aptiv also redeemed for cash the entire 650 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 315 senior notes during the year ended december 31 2019  resulting in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately 6 million  as further discussed in note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements contained herein and incurred approximately 5 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of gabocom the company also recorded 27 million during the year ended december 31 2019 related to the components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost other than service costs 

during the year ended december 31 2018  aptiv incurred approximately 18 million in transaction costs related to the acquisitions of kum and winchester and as further discussed in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein recorded a gain of 4 million on forward contracts entered into in order to hedge portions of the currency risk associated with the cash payment for the acquisition of kum during the year ended december 31 2018  aptiv also recorded 21 million of interest income and 11 million for certain fees earned pursuant to the transition services agreement in connection with the separation of the company’s former powertrain systems segment as further discussed in note 25 discontinued operations and held for sale to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein the company also recorded 18 million during the year ended december 31 2018 related to the components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost other than service costs 

refer to note 19 other income net to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

income taxes 



the company’s tax rate is affected by the fact that its parent entity was formerly a uk resident taxpayer and became an irish resident taxpayer in april 2018 the tax rates in ireland the uk and other jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance the company’s effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate 

the effective tax rate was 12 and 19 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was impacted by releases of valuation allowances as a result of the company’s determination that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized as well as favorable provision to return adjustments the company also accrued 20 million of reserve adjustments for uncertain tax positions which included reserves for ongoing audits in foreign jurisdictions as well as for changes in estimates based on relevant new or additional evidence obtained related to certain of the company’s tax positions including tax authority administrative pronouncements and court decisions 

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was impacted by approximately 30 million recorded as an adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act “the tax legislation” in the us and approximately 30 million recorded related to the company’s intellectual property transfer partially offset by favorable changes in geographic income mix primarily due to changes in the underlying operations of the business 

refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

equity income 



equity income net of tax reflects the company’s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equity method investments equity income decreased during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  primarily attributable to the performance of our joint ventures in north america and asia pacific as compared to the prior period 

results of operations by segment 

we operate our core business along the following operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

 as described in note 25 discontinued operations and held for sale to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein the company’s previously reported powertrain systems segment has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented certain original equipment service businesses that were previously included within the powertrain systems segment but which was not included in the spinoff are reported in continuing operations and have been reclassified within the advanced safety and user experience and signal and power solutions segments for all periods presented amounts for shared general and administrative operating expenses that were allocated to the powertrain systems segment in prior periods have been reallocated to the company’s reportable operating segments no amounts for shared general and administrative operating expense or interest expense were allocated to discontinued operations 

our management utilizes adjusted operating income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss to evaluate segment performance and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to the segments as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments segment adjusted operating income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to aptiv which is the most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted operating income that is prepared in accordance with us gaap segment adjusted operating income as determined and measured by aptiv should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income includes as applicable restructuring other acquisition and portfolio project costs which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions including business and product acquisitions and divestitures asset impairments gains losses on business divestitures and deferred compensation related to acquisitions the reconciliations of adjusted operating income to net income attributable to aptiv for the year s ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows 





net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales and adjusted operating income by segment for the year s ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows 

net sales by segment 



gross margin percentage by segment 



adjusted operating income by segment 



as noted in the table above adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 was impacted by volume and contractual price reductions including product mix and the adverse volume and operational impacts of approximately 110 million resulting from the gm labor strike as well as other operational performance improvements which were partially offset by incremental investment in advanced technologies and engineering as well as the following items included in other in the table above 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities and issuance of longterm debt to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions or investments additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 04 billion and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 40 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 20 billion revolving credit facility and the €300 million committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as described below 

the following table summarizes our available liquidity which includes cash cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities as of december 31 2019  the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s significant committed credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants which are described below 



 we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on ordinary shares and capital expenditures in addition we expect to continue to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares pursuant to our authorized ordinary share repurchase program as further described below 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement while a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our nonus subsidiaries and as of december 31 2019  the company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled 396 million we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to aptiv if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from nonus subsidiaries to the us however based on our current liquidity needs and strategies we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2020 and beyond

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time and we therefore cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill in addition an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations and product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

aptiv does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2019  2018 or 2017  the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom “uk” and mexico for the determination of 2019 expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 450 and 750 for the uk and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the uk and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of our plan assets is actual fair value 

our pension expense for 2020 is determined at the december 31 2019 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to continuing operations to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the company’s share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the 

amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we estimate implied fair value of goodwill in the same way as goodwill is recognized in a business combination we estimate fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired similar to the goodwill assessment described above the company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if necessary the company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset based upon its forecasted cash flows to its carrying value other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2019 are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate “transactional exposure” we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the company’s reporting currency “translational exposure” the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 2019  the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 45 million was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 2 in relation to both the euro and the chinese yuan renminbi from december 31 2018  

as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in order to manage certain translational exposure we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes and the 2016 eurodenominated senior notes as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries we have also entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain chinese yuan renminbidenominated subsidiaries the effective portion of the gains or losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment component in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in these foreign currencydenominated operations 

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty euro and turkish lira as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the net fair value liability of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 1199 million and 1412 million respectively the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 78 million and 131 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of less than 1 million and 22 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 21 million and 25 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 450 million of floating rate debt related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 125 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 010 per annum or b libor plus 110 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 010 to 025 up to a maximum of 050 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2019

 item 1 business 

“aptiv” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to aptiv plc a public limited company formed under the laws of jersey on may 19 2011 as delphi automotive plc which through its subsidiaries acquired certain assets of the former delphi corporation now known as dph holdings corp “dphh” and completed an initial public offering on november 22 2011 on december 4 2017  the “distribution date” the company completed the separation the “separation” of its former powertrain systems segment by distributing to aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of delphi technologies plc “delphi technologies” a public limited company formed to hold the spunoff business to effect the separation the company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of delphi technologies for every three aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of november 22 2017  the record date for the distribution following the separation the remaining company changed its name to aptiv plc and new york stock exchange “nyse” symbol to “aptv” 

the completion of the separation positioned aptiv as a leading global technology and mobility company primarily serving the automotive sector we design and manufacture vehicle components and provide electrical electronic and active safety technology solutions to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets creating the software and hardware foundation for vehicle features and functionality we enable and deliver endtoend smart mobility solutions active safety and autonomous driving technologies and provide enhanced user experience and connected services our advanced safety and user experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms and our signal and power solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in today’s complex vehicles together our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment 

we are one of the largest vehicle component manufacturers and our customers include all 25  of the largest automotive original equipment manufacturers “oems” in the world we operate 126  major manufacturing facilities and 15  major technical centers utilizing a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries we have a presence in 44  countries and have approximately 18600  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing market relevant product solutions for our customers 

we are focused on growing and improving the profitability of our businesses and have implemented a strategy designed to position the company to deliver industryleading longterm shareholder returns this strategy includes disciplined investing in our business to grow and enhance our product offerings strategically focusing our portfolio in hightechnology highgrowth spaces in order to meet consumer preferences and leveraging an industryleading cost structure to expand our operating margins in line with the longterm growth in emerging markets we have been increasing our focus on these markets particularly in china where we have a major manufacturing base and strong customer relationships 

website access to company’s reports 

aptiv’s website address is aptivcom  our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission “sec” our reports filed prior to december 4 2017 were under the name of delphi automotive plc 

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by rapidly increasing consumer demand for new mobility solutions advanced technologies and vehicle connectivity as well as increasing government regulation related to vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into two diversified segments which enable us to develop technology solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends 



connectivity systems active and passive safety electronics autonomous driving software and technologies and systems integration our products increase vehicle connectivity reduce driver distraction and enhance vehicle safety 

we previously reported the results of our former powertrain systems and thermal systems businesses as segments the powertrain systems segment provided gasoline and diesel engine management systems including fuel handling fuel injection combustion electronic controls test and validation capabilities electric and hybrid electric vehicle power electronics and aftermarket components as described above we completed the spinoff of the powertrain systems segment into a new independent public company named delphi technologies plc on december 4 2017  

the thermal systems business provided powertrain cooling and heating ventilating and air conditioning “hvac” systems such as compressors systems and controls and heat exchangers for vehicle markets as part of our strategy to focus on a highgrowth product portfolio we completed the sale of the wholly owned thermal systems business to mahle gmbh on june 30 2015 

the assets and liabilities operating results and operating and investing cash flows for the previously reported powertrain systems and thermal systems segments are presented as discontinued operations separate from the company’s continuing operations for all periods presented as further described in note 25 discontinued operations to the audited consolidated financial statements herein our description and discussion of financial amounts within this item 1 business reflect the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 23 segment reporting to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for financial information about our business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes all 25  of the largest automotive oems in the world and in 2018  27  of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth our ten largest platforms in 2018  were with eight different oems in addition in 2018  our products were found in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states “us” in 18 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 14 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have also entered into collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston and singapore as we develop solutions for the evolving nature of the mobility industry 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive technology and components industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2018 the industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules while north american vehicle production in 2018 remained flat  as compared to the reduced volumes experienced in the region in 2017 increased market volatility and economic uncertainty has resulted in decreases in vehicle production of 1  in europe and 4  in china as compared to 2017 vehicle production in south america our smallest region increased 4 in 2018 which follows an increase of 21 in the region in 2017 demand for automotive components in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement we aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of 

products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a notice issued by the us national highway traffic safety administration which updated its fivestar rating system to include automatic emergency braking systems as a recommended safety technology beginning with model year 2018 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the us china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2018 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide “co 2 ” emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions we are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms we are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce co 2  emissions and increase fuel economy making the world greener 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents we are pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles we also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as overtheair ota technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect marketrelevant data from connected vehicles 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

convergence of safe green and connected solutions in new mobility and autonomous driving 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety 

resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co 2  emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements 

we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with other leaders in the field to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these technologies we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to develop the centralized sensing localization and planning “cslp” system a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers and mobility partners with the goal of being application ready in 2019 and production ready in the 2021 to 2022 time frame we also entered into a collaborative arrangement with intel corporation and the bmw group to develop and deploy automated driving technology additionally in 2017 we acquired nutonomy inc in order to further accelerate our commercialization of automated driving solutions the acquisition of nutonomy is the latest in a series of investments we have made to expand our position in the new mobility space including the previous acquisitions of automated driving software developer ottomatika and data service companies controltec and movimento 

we believe the increasing societal demand for mobility on demand “mod” services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the mod space in 2018 we announced a partnership with lyft inc “lyft” by launching a fleet of autonomous vehicles in las vegas which operate on aptiv’s fullyintegrated autonomous driving platform and are available to the public on the lyft network this partnership leverages our connected services capabilities and lyft’s ridehailing experience to provide valuable insights on selfdriving fleet operations and management in addition we have entered into agreements with the singapore land transport authority and with the city of boston to develop fullyautonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure as part of automated mod pilots as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the safe green and connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation 

products 

our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines 

signal and power solutions  this segment provides complete design manufacture and assembly of the vehicle’s electrical architecture including connectors wiring assemblies and harnesses cable management electrical centers and hybrid high voltage and safety distribution systems our products provide the critical signal distribution and computing power backbone that supports increased vehicle content and electrification reduced emissions and higher fuel economy 

 advanced safety and user experience  this segment provides critical components systems and advanced software development for passenger safety security comfort and vehicle operation including body controls infotainment and connectivity systems active and passive safety electronics and autonomous driving technologies our products increase vehicle connectivity reduce driver distraction and enhance vehicle safety 

 competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in best cost countries such as china and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving and mobility solutions which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2018  



supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2018  we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material 

specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our signal and power solutions segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we employed approximately 143000 people 25000 salaried employees and 118000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 19000 contract and temporary workers certain of our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the international union of electronic electrical salaried machine and furniture workers  communications workers of america “iuecwa” and the confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us certain of our employees are represented by only the iuecwa with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  4 million  and 5 million  respectively we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to overall global economic conditions in 2018  the automotive industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2017  vehicle production in 2018  remained flat  in north america and decreased by 1  in europe and 4  in china vehicle production in south america our smallest region increased 4  as compared to 2017 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in certain regions uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems’ vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and 

financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth 

the global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies which have attracted new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future 

in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mod services could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mod services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a longterm reduction in the number of vehicles per capita these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

we have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key geographic market and have identified advanced driver assistance systems autonomous driving technologies and mobility solutions as a key product market we believe these markets are likely to experience substantial longterm growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the asia pacific region or if we are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues for example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to evolving guidance issued by the us department of transportation “dot” regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of 

these systems including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads there remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the dot or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction it is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs 

we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in developing marketrelevant products depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies there are certain risks involved in such relationships as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations may be acquired by other companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement may compete with us may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs which could adversely affect our business and operational results 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 41 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2018  accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive technology and components market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the longterm we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive 

production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example in 2017  automotive production in china increased 3  as compared to 2016  benefiting in part from a partial increase in the consumer vehicle tax reduction program however primarily due to moderations in the level of economic growth and foreign trade uncertainties vehicle production volumes in china decreased by 4  in 2018  our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china continue to decrease our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products for example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and costcutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in best cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be 

positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our thirdparty suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 58 million as of december 31 2018  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 447 million  at december 31 2018  of which 17 million  is included in accrued liabilities 432 million  is included in longterm liabilities and 2 million  is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facility’s building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s value is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not met the company then performs a quantitative assessment by first comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot ensure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 63  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  came from sales outside the us which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro and chinese yuan renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 63  of our net revenue came from sales outside the us international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 



 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters for instance the recent presidential elections and government changes in mexico have yielded requirements that call for an increase in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of mexico these or any further political or governmental developments in mexico or other countries in which we operate could result in social economic and labor instability these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and its anticipated successor agreement the united statesmexicocanada agreement which is still subject to approval provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results for instance during 2018 the us and chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products most notably with respect to the automotive industry the us imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel aluminum and automotive components and china imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of us vehicles and certain automotive components given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the us china or other countries we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our longterm strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

the results of the referendum of the united kingdom’s membership of the european union may adversely affect our business and profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom “uk” and europe as a result of the uk referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” scheduled to become effective on march 29 2019 as a result of the referendum the british government formally initiated the process for withdrawal in march 2017 the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the initiation date nevertheless the proposed withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions including vehicle production significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we do not have a material physical presence in the uk approximately 1  of our annual net sales are generated in the uk and less than 1 of our global workforce is located in the uk as of december 31 2018 the potential impacts of the impending brexit decision could adversely impact other global economies and in particular the european economy a region which accounted for approximately 32  of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business through review of our existing contractual arrangements and obligations particularly in the european region any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years most recently the acquisitions of winchester interconnect and kum and we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers contain sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyber attacks and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged or go undetected cyber attacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect although we have taken precautions to prevent detect and mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally certain of our products contain complex information technology systems designed to support today’s increasingly connected vehicles and could be susceptible to similar interruptions including the possibility of unauthorized access further as we transition to offering more cloudbased solutions we may increasingly be the target of cyber threats although we have designed and implemented security measures to prevent such unauthorized access there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our security efforts are or will be successful any unauthorized access to our components could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

to date we have not experienced a system failure cyber attack or security breach that has resulted in a material interruption in our operations or material adverse effect on our financial condition our board of directors regularly reviews relevant information technology and cyber security matters and receives periodic updates from information technology and cyber security subject matter experts as part of its risk assessment procedures including analysis of existing and emerging risks as well as plans and strategies to address those risks while we continuously seek to expand and improve our information technology systems and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to thirdparty disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million  at december 31 2018  for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot ensure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require 

installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2018  the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2018  claims totaling approximately 145 million  using december 31 2018  foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2018  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 30 million  using december 31 2018  foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2017 spinoff of delphi technologies could materially and adversely affect our business 

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with delphi technologies to govern the separation and the relationship between the two companies following the completion of the separation these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to future liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between apitv and such other parties and require aptiv to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and trade names and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws additionally in determining the 

adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

we have no unresolved sec staff comments to report 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or leased 126  major manufacturing sites and 15  major technical centers a manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased we also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world we have a presence in 44  countries the following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities 



in addition to these manufacturing sites we had 15  major technical centers eight  in north america two  in europe middle east and africa and five  in asia pacific 

of our 126  major manufacturing sites and 15  major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 61  are primarily owned and 80  are primarily leased 

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

brazil matters 

aptiv conducts business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while aptiv believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2018  the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2018  claims totaling approximately 145 million  using december 31 2018  foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2018  the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of 30 million  using december 31 2018  foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and aptiv’s results of 

operations could be materially affected the company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero  to 115 million

we are one of the largest vehicle component manufacturers and our customers include all 25  of the largest automotive original equipment manufacturers “oems” in the world 

business strategy 

we believe the company is wellpositioned for growth from increasing global vehicle production volumes increased demand for our safe green and connected products which are being added to vehicle content and new business wins with existing and new customers we are focused on accelerating the commercialization of active safety autonomous driving enhanced user experiences and connected services providing the software advanced computing platforms and networking architecture required to do so we have successfully created a competitive cost structure while investing in research and development to grow our product offerings which are aligned with the highgrowth industry megatrends and realigned our manufacturing footprint into an efficient lowcost regional service model focused on increasing our profit margins 

our achievements in 2018  included the following 

 our strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative marketrelevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous forwardlooking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to our customers we are committed to creating value for our shareholders we repurchased 499 million  of ordinary shares in 2018  and in january 2019 announced a new share repurchase program of up to 20 billion  of ordinary shares we also continued to return cash to our shareholders paying cash dividends totaling 233 million  in 2018  our key strategic priorities include 

commercializing the hightech evolution of the automotive industry  the automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of softwaredependent components and solutions in particular the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions 

we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to develop the centralized sensing localization and planning “cslp” system a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers and mobility partners with the goal of being application ready in 2019 and production ready in the 2021 to 2022 time frame we also entered into a collaborative arrangement with intel corporation and the bmw group to develop and deploy automated driving technology additionally in 2017 we acquired nutonomy inc in order to further accelerate the commercialization of automated driving solutions the acquisition of nutonomy is the latest in a series of investments we have made to expand our position in the new mobility space including the prior period acquisitions of automated driving software developer ottomatika and data service companies controltec and movimento 

there has also been increasing societal demand for mobility on demand “mod” services such as car and ridesharing and an increasing number of traditional automotive companies have made investments in the mod space we believe the increasing societal demand for mod services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly 

benefiting the mod space in 2018 we announced a partnership with lyft inc “lyft” by launching a fleet of autonomous vehicles in las vegas which operate on aptiv’s fullyintegrated autonomous driving platform and are available to the public on the lyft network this partnership leverages our connected services capabilities and lyft’s ridehailing experience to provide valuable insights on selfdriving fleet operations and management in addition we have entered into agreements with the singapore land transport authority and with the city of boston to develop fullyautonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure as part of automated mod pilots as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

we are focused on enabling and delivering endtoend smart mobility solutions accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services our advanced safety and user experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms and our signal and power solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in today’s complex vehicles together our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment 

however there are many risks associated with these evolving areas including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and new and emerging regulations such as the recently released federal guidance for automated driving systems published by the us department of transportation while we believe we are wellpositioned in these markets the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines 

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 15  major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  during 2018 we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

economic conditions  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions although 

global automotive vehicle production decreased 1  from 2017  to 2018  the levels of automotive vehicle production were uneven from a regional perspective compared to 2017 vehicle production in 2018 in north america remained flat  as compared to the reduced volumes experienced in the region in 2017 while vehicle production decreased by 1  in europe and 4  in china vehicle production in south america our smallest region increased 4 compared to 2017 refer to note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for financial information concerning principal geographic areas 

economic volatility or weakness in north america europe china or south america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the us and other economies and specifically the automotive sector in particular changes to international trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement and its anticipated successor agreement the united statesmexicocanada agreement which is still subject to approval or other political pressures could affect the operations of our oem customers resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom “uk” and europe as a result of the uk referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” scheduled to become effective on march 29 2019 as a result of the referendum the british government formally initiated the process for withdrawal in march 2017 the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the initiation date nevertheless the proposed withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions including vehicle production significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we do not have a material physical presence in the uk approximately 1  of our annual net sales are generated in the uk and less than 1 of our global workforce is located in the uk as of december 31 2018 the potential impacts of the impending brexit decision could adversely impact other global economies and in particular the european economy a region which accounted for approximately 32  of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business through review of our existing contractual arrangements and obligations particularly in the european region 

key growth markets  there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced despite these recent moderations in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the longterm our strong global presence and presence in these markets has positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the longterm we continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets positioning us to benefit from the expected longterm growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets 

we have a strong local presence in china including a major manufacturing base and wellestablished customer relationships each of our business segments have operations and sales in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in china and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china however we continue to believe there is longterm growth potential in this market based on increasing longterm automotive and vehicle content demand 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety electrification high speed data connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies we are benefiting from the substantial 

increase in vehicle content software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology we have developed a 48volt mild hybrid vehicle electrical architecture solution which maximizes the use of 48volt electrification to minimize the demand on the engine improving performance while lowering co 2 emissions by more than 10 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions 

our global operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or tax fiscal policy including tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers for instance the recent presidential elections and government changes in mexico have yielded requirements that call for an increase in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of mexico these or any further political or governmental developments in mexico or other countries in which we operate could result in social economic and labor instability in addition existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and its anticipated successor agreement the united statesmexicocanada agreement which is still subject to approval provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results for instance during 2018 the us and chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products most notably with respect to the automotive industry the us imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel aluminum and automotive components and china imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of us vehicles and certain automotive components while these tariffs could have potentially adverse economic impacts particularly with respect to the automotive industry and vehicle production levels we do not anticipate a significant impact to our operations as we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate adverse tariff impacts such as production localization and relocation contract review and renegotiation and working with the appropriate governmental agencies further our global footprint and regional model serves to minimize our exposure to crossborder transactions however the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs remain uncertain 

product development  the automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally and is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for hightechnology content in automobiles 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of approximately 18600  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15  major technical centers in china germany india mexico poland singapore and the united states our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 1443 million  1086 million  and 969 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively which includes approximately 288 million  204 million  and 181 million  of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yearto 

year it is generally in the range of 15 to 20 of engineering expenses we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions for example we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to develop a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers and mobility partners with the goal of being application ready in 2019 and production ready in the 2021 to 2022 time frame our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 288 million  annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  

we maintain a large portfolio of approximately 7100 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of december 31 2018  while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 96  of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 13  of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2018  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing our global overhead costs as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2018  results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 43 billion  and substantial available liquidity of approximately 26 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility and committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2018  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions 

given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

for example in september 2016 one of our oem customers initiated a recall of approximately 364 million vehicles in the us to enhance the airbag deployment system the company supplied sensors and related control modules for the airbags in the affected vehicles although aptiv believes it supplied these components in compliance with the customer’s product specifications and validation criteria we assisted with our customer’s efforts surrounding its recall and during the first quarter of 2017 reached an agreement with our customer to share costs associated with the recall accordingly during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized an incremental 43 million charge in addition to our previously recorded reserve estimate related to this matter 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally additionally new entrants from outside the traditional automotive industry may seek to gain access to certain vehicle component markets as evidenced by the acquisition of harman international industries incorporated by samsung electronics co ltd and the acquisition of mobileye nv by intel corporation we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

consolidated results of operations 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2018  were 144 billion  an increase of 12  compared to 2017  this compares to total global oem production decreases of 1  in 2018  the increase in our total net sales is primarily attributable to continued increased volumes in all major regions as well as incremental sales as a result of our acquisitions of kum in june 2018 and winchester in october 2018 our overall lean cost structure along with abovemarket sales growth in all major regions has enabled us to maintain strong levels of operating income while continuing to strategically invest in the future 

the increase in our total net sales of 5  during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily attributable to continued increased volumes in the europe and asia pacific regions partially offset by volume decreases of 4 in the north america region 

aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as “fx” contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue 

to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

2018  versus 2017 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2018  versus december 31 2017  



total net sales for the year  ended december 31 2018   increased   12  compared to the year  ended december 31 2017  we experienced volume growth of 11  for the period primarily as a result of increased sales in all major regions including net sales of 182 million as a result of the acquisitions of kum in june 2018 and winchester in october 2018 and favorable foreign currency impacts primarily related to the euro and chinese yuan renminbi partially offsetting these increases were decreases due to contractual price reductions refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further information regarding acquisitions and divestitures 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and 

other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

cost of sales increased   1436 million  for the year  ended december 31 2018  compared to the year  ended december 31 2017  as summarized below the company’s material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  



 the increase  in cost of sales reflects increased volumes and the impacts from currency exchange as well as incremental investment in advanced technologies and engineering partially offset by improved operational performance the increase  in cost of sales is also attributable to the following items in other above 

 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs sga decreased as percentage of net sales for the year  ended december 31 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives including our continuing rotation to best cost manufacturing locations in europe and initiatives focused on reducing global overhead costs 

amortization 



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the period the increase in amortization during the year  ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017 reflects 30 million  of intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the year  ended december 31 2018  and the continued amortization of our definitelived intangible assets which resulted primarily from our acquisitions over their estimated useful lives refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of our business acquisitions including details of the intangible assets recorded in each transaction 

in 2019  we expect to incur noncash amortization charges of approximately 146 million  

restructuring 



restructuring charges recorded during 2018  were primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and to reduce global overhead costs including realignment of the company’s organizational structure due to changes in roles and workforce resulting from the spinoff of the powertrain systems segment the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 109 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  of which 64 million  was recognized for programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and reducing overhead costs in the region we expect to make cash payments of approximately 55 million  in 2019  pursuant to these implemented restructuring programs 

restructuring charges recorded during 2017  were primarily attributable to our restructuring programs which focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing global overhead costs the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 129 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  of which 89 million  was recognized for programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and reducing overhead costs in the region the charges recorded during the year ended december 31 2017  included the recognition of approximately 36 million of employeerelated and other costs related to the initiation of a program to close a western european advanced safety and user experience manufacturing site pursuant to the company’s ongoing european footprint rotation strategy 

we expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2019 primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and to reduce global overhead costs additionally as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint the company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future if necessary in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions customer actions and other factors

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities and issuance of longterm debt to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions or investments additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 06 billion  and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 38 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 20 billion revolving credit facility and the €300 million committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as described below 

the following table summarizes our available liquidity which includes cash cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities as of december 31 2018  the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s significant committed credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants which are described below 



 we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on ordinary shares and capital expenditures in addition we expect to continue to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares pursuant to our authorized ordinary share repurchase program as further described below 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement while a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our nonus subsidiaries and as of december 31 2018  the company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled 514 million we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to aptiv if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from nonus subsidiaries to the us however based on our current liquidity needs and strategies we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2019  and beyond

benefit expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans 3 a sensitivity analysis of potential changes to pension obligations and expense that would result from changes in key assumptions and 4 funding obligations 

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time and we therefore cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  of which 1 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 3 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 4 million  which was recorded in other longterm liabilities aptiv cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded aptiv’s results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill in addition an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component such as our acquisition agreement for nutonomy the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations and product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration “nhtsa” has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as 

the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

aptiv does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2018  2017  or 2016  the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom “uk” and mexico for the determination of 2018  expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 550  and 750  for the uk and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the uk and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of our plan assets is actual fair value 

our pension expense for 2019  is determined at the december 31 2018  measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to continuing operations to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the company’s share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we estimate implied  fair value of goodwill in the same way as goodwill is recognized in a business combination we estimate fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired similar to the goodwill assessment described above the company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if necessary the company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset based upon its forecasted cash flows to its carrying value other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2018  the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net 

derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we were in a net derivative liability position of 20 million  and a net derivative asset position of 12 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because aptiv’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the aptiv plc long term incentive plan as amended and restated effective april 23 2015 “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to aptiv’s executives have been made under the plc ltip in each year from 2012 to 2018  and are expected to continue to be made annually the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions that impact the performancebased vesting portion of the rsus we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the company’s best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets on a straightline basis over the requisite vesting period of the awards adjusted for an estimate for forfeitures the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as differences in actual results from management’s estimates could result in estimated or actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the company’s future results of operations and financial condition 

modifications to the terms of sharebased awards are treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with the resulting total compensation cost equal to the grantdate fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award the calculation of the incremental value is based on the excess of the fair value of the new modified award based on current circumstances over the fair value of the original award measured immediately before its terms are modified based on current circumstances to the extent there is incremental compensation cost relating to the newly modified award it is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2018  are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate “transactional exposure” we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the company’s reporting currency “translational exposure” the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 2018  the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 194 million  was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 5 in relation to both the euro and the chinese yuan renminbi from december 31 2017  

as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in order to manage certain translational exposure we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes and the 2016 eurodenominated senior notes as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries we have also entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain chinese yuan renminbidenominated subsidiaries the effective portion of the gains or losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment component in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in these foreign currencydenominated operations 

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty euro and turkish lira as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  the net fair value liability of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 1412 million and 1397 million respectively the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 131 million and 156 million at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximately 22 million  and an asset of approximately 35 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 25 million and 19 million at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 385 million  of floating rate debt related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 125 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 010 per annum or b libor plus 110 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit 

facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 010 to 025 up to a maximum of 050 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2018

our history 

in october 2005 old delphi and certain of its united states “us” subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the “bankruptcy court” old delphis nonus subsidiaries which were not included in the chapter 11 filings continued their business operations without supervision from the bankruptcy court and were not subject to the requirements of the bankruptcy code on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of old delphi and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to old delphi general motors company “gm” and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was 

exchanged by its equity holders for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

on december 4 2017  the company completed the separation of its former powertrain systems segment by distributing to aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the outstanding ordinary shares of delphi technologies plc to effect the separation the company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of delphi technologies for every three aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of november 22 2017  the record date for the distribution following the separation the remaining company changed its name to aptiv plc 

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by rapidly increasing consumer demand for new mobility solutions advanced technologies and vehicle connectivity as well as increasing government regulation related to vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into two diversified segments which enable us to develop technology solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends 

 we previously reported the results of our former powertrain systems and thermal systems businesses as segments the powertrain systems segment provided gasoline and diesel engine management systems including fuel handling fuel injection combustion electronic controls test and validation capabilities electric and hybrid electric vehicle power electronics and aftermarket components as described above we completed the spinoff of the powertrain systems segment into a new independent public company named delphi technologies plc on december 4 2017  

the thermal systems business provided powertrain cooling and heating ventilating and air conditioning “hvac” systems such as compressors systems and controls and heat exchangers for vehicle markets as part of our strategy to focus on a highgrowth product portfolio we completed the sale of the wholly owned thermal systems business to mahle gmbh mahle on june 30 2015 

the assets and liabilities operating results and operating and investing cash flows for the previously reported powertrain systems and thermal systems segments are presented as discontinued operations separate from the company’s continuing operations for all periods presented as further described in note 25 discontinued operations to the audited consolidated financial statements herein our description and discussion of financial amounts within this item 1 business reflect the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

financial information about business segments 

we operate our core business along two operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

net sales by segment 



refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for further financial information about business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes all 25  of the largest automotive oems in the world and in 2017  28  of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth our ten largest platforms in 2017  were with eight different oems in addition in 2017  our products were found in all of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 13 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have also entered into collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as boston and singapore as we develop solutions for the evolving nature of the mobility industry 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive technology and components industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2017 the industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2016 vehicle production in 2017 increased by 4  in europe 3  in china and 21 in south america however after several years of increases consumer demand for vehicles in north america receded resulting in a 4 decrease in north american production in 2017 as compared to the increased volumes experienced in 2016 demand for automotive components in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a notice issued by the us national highway traffic safety administration which updated its fivestar rating system to include automatic emergency braking systems as a recommended safety technology beginning with model year 2018 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in 

the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2017 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide co 2    emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions we are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of charging and on vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers electrified vehicle platforms 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate todays highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents we are pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles we are also developing advanced connectivity solutions such as overtheair ota technology that will enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect marketrelevant data from connected vehicles 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

convergence of safe green and connected solutions in new mobility and autonomous driving 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co 2  emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the safe green and connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation 

products 

our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines 

signal and power solutions this segment provides complete design manufacture and assembly of the vehicle’s electrical architecture including connectors wiring assemblies and harnesses cable management electrical centers and hybrid high voltage and safety distribution systems our products provide the critical signal distribution and computing power backbone that supports increased vehicle content and electrification reduced emissions and higher fuel economy 

 advanced safety and user experience this segment provides critical components systems and advanced software development for passenger safety security comfort and vehicle operation including body controls infotainment and connectivity systems passive and active safety electronics autonomous driving technologies and displays our products increase vehicle connectivity reduce driver distraction and enhance vehicle safety 



competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive supply industry remains extremely competitive furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving and mobility solutions which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2017  





supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  net property data is as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  





research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 16000  scientists engineers and technicians around the world our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 1086 million  969 million  and 895 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively which includes approximately 204 million  181 million  and 175 million  of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 15 to 20 of engineering expenses 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2017  we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our signal and power solutions segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 129000 people 22000 salaried employees and 107000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 18000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the international union of electronic electrical salaried machine and furniture workers  communications workers of america iuecwa and the confederacion de 

trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  5 million  and 3 million  respectively additionally as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations included within liabilities of discontinued operations was approximately 1 million  and 7 million  respectively none of which related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to overall strong global economic conditions in 2017 the automotive industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2016 vehicle production in 2017 increased by 4  in europe 3  in china and 21  in south america however after several years of increases consumer demand for vehicles in north america receded resulting in a 4 decrease in north american production in 2017 as compared to the increased volumes experienced in 2016 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in certain regions uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and 

financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth 

the global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies which have attracted new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future 

in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a long term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

we have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key geographic market and have identified advanced driver assistance systems autonomous driving technologies and mobility solutions as a key product market we believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long term growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the asia pacific region or if we are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues for example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to evolving guidance issued by the us department of transportation dot regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of these systems including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads there remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the dot or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction it is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs 

we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently 

we believe that for certain of our businesses success in developing marketrelevant products depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies there are certain risks involved in such relationships as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations may be acquired by other companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement may compete with us may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs which could adversely affect our business and operational results 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 41 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2017  accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the long term we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example in 2016 automotive production in china increased 15  as compared to 2015 benefiting in part from a consumer vehicle tax reduction program following a partial increase in the consumer vehicle tax in 2017 vehicle production volumes in china increased by 3  in 2017 our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products for example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in best cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the 

customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 50 million as of december 31 2017  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 458 million  at december 31 2017  of which 31 million  is included in accrued liabilities 431 million  is included in longterm liabilities and 4 million  is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units value is less than its carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not met the company then performs a quantitative assessment by first comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot ensure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 64  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  came from sales outside the united states which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro and chinese yuan renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2017  

approximately 64  of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 

 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our long term strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

the results of the referendum of the united kingdom’s membership of the european union may adversely affect our business and profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom “uk” and europe as a result of the uk referendum held on june 23 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government formally initiated the process for withdrawal in march 2017 the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the initiation date nevertheless the proposed withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we are actively monitoring the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows approximately 1  of our annual net sales are generated in the uk and less than 1 are denominated in british pounds 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years most recently the acquisition of nutonomy inc and we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves 

extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyber attack malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally certain of our products contain complex information technology systems designed to support todays increasingly connected vehicles and could be susceptible to similar interruptions including the possibility of unauthorized access although we have designed and implemented security measures to prevent such unauthorized access there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our security efforts are or will be successful any unauthorized access to our components could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly 

evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million  at december 31 2017  for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2017  the majority of claims asserted against aptiv in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2017  claims totaling approximately 185 million  using december 31 2017  foreign currency rates have been asserted against aptiv in brazil as of december 31 2017  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 25 million  using december 31 2017  foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2017 spinoff of delphi technologies could materially and adversely affect our business 

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with delphi technologies to govern the separation and the relationship between the two companies following the completion of the separation these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to future liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations it is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between apitv and such other parties and require aptiv to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws additionally in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

we have no unresolved sec staff comments to report 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or leased 109  major manufacturing sites and 14  major technical centers a manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased we also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world we have a presence in 45  countries the following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities 



in addition to these manufacturing sites we had 14  major technical centers eight  in north america two  in europe middle east and africa and four  in asia pacific 

of our 109  major manufacturing sites and 14  major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 53 are primarily owned and 70 are primarily leased 

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

unsecured creditors litigation 

aptiv has been subject to ongoing litigation related to general unsecured claims against the former delphi corporation now known as dphh resulting from that entitys 2005 bankruptcy filing the fourth amended and restated limited liability partnership agreement of delphi automotive llp the “fourth llp agreement” was entered into on july 12 2011 by the members of delphi automotive llp in order to position the company for its initial public offering under the terms of the fourth llp agreement if cumulative distributions to the members of delphi automotive llp under certain provisions of the fourth llp agreement exceed 72 billion  aptiv as disbursing agent on behalf of dphh is required to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against dphh 3250  for every 6750  in excess of 72 billion  distributed to the members up to a maximum amount of 300 million  in december 2014 a complaint was filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court alleging that the 2011 redemption by delphi automotive llp of the membership interests of gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc totaling 44 billion and the subsequent repurchase of shares and payment of dividends by aptiv plc constituted distributions under the terms of the fourth llp agreement approximating 72 billion  triggering the maximum 300 million distribution to the holders of general unsecured claims 

in may 2016 the bankruptcy court initially denied both parties motions for summary judgment requiring further submissions to the bankruptcy court regarding the parties intent with respect to the redemptions of the gm and pbgc membership interests on january 12 2017 the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs ruling that the membership interest redemption payments qualified as distributions which along with share repurchases and dividend 

payments made by aptiv count toward the 72 billion  threshold and thus the 300 million  maximum distribution for general unsecured claims has been triggered 

in connection with the january 2017 ruling the company recorded a reserve of 300 million  in the fourth quarter of 2016 the reserve was recorded to other expense in the consolidated statement of operations and resulted in a corresponding reduction in earnings per diluted share of approximately 110  for the year ended december 31 2016 in march 2017 the bankruptcy court issued a ruling on the application of prejudgment interest owed on the amount of the distribution to be made to the holders of general unsecured claims 

during the three months ended june 30 2017 aptiv and the plaintiffs reached an agreement to settle this matter for 310 million which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court in july 2017 the company paid the 310 million settlement pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement the company recorded a net incremental charge of 10 million  to other expense during the year ended december 31 2017

we are a leading global technology and mobility company serving the automotive sector we design and manufacture vehicle components and provide electrical electronic and active safety technology solutions to the global automotive markets creating the software and hardware foundation for vehicle features and functionality we enable and deliver endtoend smart mobility solutions active safety and autonomous driving technologies and provide enhanced user experience and connected services our advanced safety and user experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms and our signal and power solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in todays complex vehicles together our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment 

we are one of the largest vehicle component manufacturers and our customers include all 25  of the largest automotive original equipment manufacturers “oems” in the world 

business strategy 

we believe the company is wellpositioned for growth from increasing global vehicle production volumes increased demand for our safe green and connected products which are being added to vehicle content and new business wins with existing and new customers we are focused on accelerating the commercialization of active safety autonomous driving enhanced user experiences and connected services providing the software advanced computing platforms and networking architecture required to do so we have successfully created a competitive cost structure while investing in research and development to grow our product offerings which are aligned with the highgrowth industry megatrends and realigned our manufacturing footprint into an efficient lowcost regional service model allowing us to increase our profit margins 

our achievements in 2017  included the following 

 our strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative marketrelevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous forwardlooking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to our customers we are committed to creating value for our shareholders we repurchased 383 million  of ordinary shares in 2017  we also continued to return cash to our shareholders paying cash dividends totaling 310 million  in 2017  our key strategic priorities include 

commercializing the hightech evolution of the automotive industry  the automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of softwaredependent components and solutions in particular the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long term growth for our product offerings in this space we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions 

we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to develop the centralized sensing localization and planning cslp system a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers and mobility partners with the goal of being production ready in 2019 we also entered into a collaborative arrangement with intel corporation and the bmw group to develop and deploy automated driving technology additionally in 2017 we acquired nutonomy inc in order to further accelerate the commercialization of automated driving solutions the acquisition of nutonomy is the latest in a series of investments we have made to expand our position in the new mobility space including the prior period acquisitions of automated driving software developer ottomatika and data service companies controltec and movimento 

there has also been increasing societal demand for mobility on demand mod services such as car and ridesharing and an increasing number of traditional automotive companies have made investments in the mod space we believe the increasing societal demand for mod services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the mod space we have entered into agreements with the singapore land transport authority and with the city of boston to develop fullyautonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure as part of automated mod pilots as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

we are focused on enabling and delivering endtoend smart mobility solutions accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services our advanced safety and user experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms and our signal and power solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in todays complex vehicles together our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment 

however there are many risks associated with these evolving areas including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and new and emerging regulations such as the recently released federal guidance for automated driving systems published by the us department of transportation while we believe we are wellpositioned in these markets the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines 

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 14  major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will 

continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  during 2017 we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments particularly within the new mobility space we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

economic conditions  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production increased 3  from 2016  to 2017  the levels of vehicle production were uneven from a regional perspective compared to 2016 vehicle production in 2017 increased by 4  in europe 3  in china and 21 in south america however after several years of increases consumer demand for vehicles in north america receded resulting in a 4 decrease in north american production in 2017 as compared to the increased volumes experienced in 2016 

economic volatility or weakness in north america europe china or south america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the us and other economies and specifically the automotive sector in particular changes to international trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our oem customers resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom “uk” and europe as a result of the uk referendum held on june 23 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the british government formally initiated the process for withdrawal in march 2017 the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the initiation date nevertheless the proposed withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the uk and the eu these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we are actively monitoring the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows approximately 1  of our annual net sales are generated in the uk and less than 1 are denominated in british pounds 

key growth markets  there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced despite these recent moderations in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long term our strong global presence and presence in these markets has positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the long term we continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets positioning us to benefit from the expected long term growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets 

we have a strong local presence in china including a major manufacturing base and wellestablished customer relationships each of our business segments have operations and sales in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in china and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china however we continue to believe there is long term growth potential in this market based on increasing long term automotive and vehicle content demand 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety electrification high speed data connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies we are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology we have developed a 48volt mild hybrid vehicle electrical architecture solution which maximizes the use of 48volt electrification to minimize the demand on the engine improving performance while lowering co 2 emissions by more than 10 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions 

our global operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or tax fiscal policy including tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally and is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for hightechnology content in automobiles 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of approximately 16000  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 14  major technical centers in china germany india mexico poland singapore and the united states we invest approximately 1086 million  which includes approximately 204 million  coinvestment by customers and government agencies annually in research and development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and ownedheld approximately 6300 patents and protective rights as of december 31 2017  we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions for example we have entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye to jointly develop a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers with the goal of being production ready for 2019 our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 204 million  annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected 

volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 97  of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 14  of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2017  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and on reducing our global overhead costs as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2017  results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 41 billion  and substantial available liquidity of approximately 39 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility and committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2017  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

for example in september 2016 one of our oem customers initiated a recall of approximately 364 million vehicles in the united states to enhance the airbag deployment system the company supplied sensors and related control modules for the airbags in the affected vehicles although aptiv believes it supplied these components in compliance with the customers product specifications and validation criteria we assisted with our customers efforts surrounding its recall and during the first quarter of 2017 reached an agreement with our customer to share costs associated with the recall accordingly during the year ended december 31 2017  we recognized an incremental 43 million charge in addition to our previously recorded reserve estimate related to this matter 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally additionally new entrants from outside the traditional automotive industry may seek to gain access to certain vehicle component markets as evidenced by the acquisition of harman international industries incorporated by samsung electronics co ltd and the acquisition of mobileye nv by intel corporation we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of old delphi “the acquisition” which along 

with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of old delphi and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to old delphi general motors company gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares by its equity holders in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

on december 4 2017  the company completed the separation of its former powertrain systems segment by means of a spinoff to its shareholders following the separation the remaining company changed its name to aptiv plc and nyse symbol to aptv the new independent public company formed for the powertrain systems business was named delphi technologies plc and trades on the nyse under the symbol dlph 

consolidated results of operations 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2017  were 129 billion  an increase of 5  compared to 2016  this compares to total global oem production increases of 3  in 2017  the increase in our total net sales is primarily attributable to continued increased volumes in the europe and asia pacific regions partially offset by volume decreases of 4  in the north america region our overall lean cost structure enabled us to achieve abovemarket sales growth in each region and maintain strong levels of operating income while continuing to strategically invest in the future 

the increase in our total net sales of 13  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily attributable to continued increased volumes in the north america europe and asia pacific regions as well as incremental sales as a result of our acquisition of hellermanntyton in december 2015 partially offsetting these increased volumes were reduced sales in our smallest region south america due to continued economic weakness resulting in continued reductions in oem production schedules in the region 

aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

2017  versus 2016 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2017  versus december 31 2016  



total net sales for the year  ended december 31 2017   increased   5  compared to the year  ended december 31 2016  we experienced volume growth of 8 for the period primarily as a result of increased sales in europe and asia pacific and favorable currency impacts primarily related to the euro which was partially offset by decreases due to contractual price reductions net sales also decreased by a net 270 million  as a result of acquisitions and divestitures reflected in other above primarily due to the divestiture of our mechatronics business in the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by the acquisition of movimento in 2017 refer to note 20 acquisitions and divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further information regarding acquisitions and divestitures 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

cost of sales increased   743 million  for the year  ended december 31 2017  compared to the year  ended december 31 2016  as summarized below the companys material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  



 the increase  in cost of sales reflects increased volumes partially offset by improved operational performance and the impacts from currency exchange the increase  in cost of sales is also attributable to the following items in other above 

 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and decreased as percentage of sales for the year  ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  the decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the impact of cost reduction initiatives including our continuing rotation to best cost manufacturing locations in europe and initiatives focused on reducing global overhead costs 

amortization 



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets the consistency in amortization during the year  ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016 reflects the continued amortization of our definitelived intangible assets which resulted primarily from our acquisitions over their estimated useful lives 

in 2018 we expect to incur noncash amortization charges of approximately 117 million  

restructuring 



restructuring charges recorded during 2017  were primarily related to programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe and to reduce global overhead costs including realignment of the companys organizational structure due to changes in roles and workforce resulting from the spinoff of the powertrain systems segment the company recorded employeerelated and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately 129 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  of which 89 million  was recognized for programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in europe the charges recorded during the year ended december 31 2017  included the recognition of approximately 36 million of employeerelated and other costs related to the initiation of a program to close a western european advanced safety and user experience manufacturing site pursuant to the companys ongoing european footprint rotation strategy cash payments for this restructuring action are expected to be principally completed by 2019  we expect to make cash payments of approximately 90 million  in 2018 pursuant to these implemented restructuring programs

interest expense 



the decrease  in interest expense compared to the prior year period primarily reflects the redemption of 800 million of 500 senior unsecured notes partially offset by the issuance of €500 million  of 160  eurodenominated senior unsecured notes and 300 million  of 440  senior unsecured notes in september 2016

income taxes 



the company’s tax rate is affected by the fact that its parent entity is a uk resident taxpayer the tax rates in the uk and other jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance 

the effective tax rate was 18  and 17  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2017  was impacted by increased tax expense of approximately 50 million  due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax legislation in the united states on december 22 2017 partially offset by favorable geographic income mix as compared to 2016 primarily due to changes in the underlying business operations the tax legislation significantly revises the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering corporate income tax rates and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries this impact was primarily the result of increased tax expense due to the onetime deemed repatriation tax and a reduction of our foreign tax credit partially offset by the favorable impact of the reduced tax rate on the company’s net deferred tax liabilities pursuant to the guidance within sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” as of december 31 2017 the company recognized the provisional effects of the enactment of the tax legislation for which measurement could be reasonably estimated although the company continues to analyze certain aspects of the tax legislation and refine its assessment the ultimate impact of the tax legislation may differ from these estimates due to its continued analysis or further regulatory guidance that may be issued as a result of the tax legislation pursuant to sab 118 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded by the company as of december 31 2017 that are identified within a subsequent measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date will be included as an adjustment to tax expense from continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined 

the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2016 was impacted by favorable geographic income mix in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to changes in the underlying operations of the business as well as 17 million  for releases of valuation allowances as a result of the companys determination that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized these benefits were offset by 76 million of reserve adjustments recorded for uncertain tax positions which included reserves for ongoing audits in foreign jurisdictions as well as for changes in estimates based on relevant new or additional evidence obtained related to certain of the companys tax positions including tax authority administrative pronouncements and court decisions these reserve adjustments resulted in foreign tax credit benefits of approximately 18

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities and issuance of longterm debt to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions or investments additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 16 billion  and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 26 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 20 billion revolving credit facility and the €300 million committed european accounts receivable factoring facility 

the following table summarizes our available liquidity which includes cash cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities as of december 31 2017  the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s significant committed credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants which are described below 



1 availability reduced by 7 million  in letters of credit issued under the credit agreement as of december 31 2017  

2 based on december 31 2017  foreign currency rates subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable 

we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on ordinary shares and capital expenditures in addition we expect to continue to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares pursuant to our authorized ordinary share repurchase program as further described below 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement while a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our nonus subsidiaries and as of december 31 2017  the companys cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled 15 billion we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to aptiv if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from nonus subsidiaries to the us however based on our current liquidity needs and strategies we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2018  and beyond

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  which was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 5 million  of which 1 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 4 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities additionally as of december 31 2016  approximately 1 million  of undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations was included within liabilities of discontinued operations aptiv cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded aptiv’s results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill in addition an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component such as our acquisition agreements for nutonomy movimento controltec and ottomatika the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part 

of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations and product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

aptiv does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2017  2016  or 2015  the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2017  expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 550  and 750  for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of approximately 100  of our plan assets is actual fair value the expected return on the remainder of our plan assets is determined by applying the expected longterm rate of return on assets to a calculated marketrelated value of these plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of the plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 

our pension expense for 2018  is determined at the december 31 2017  measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to continuing operations to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the companys share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we estimate implied  fair value of goodwill in the same way as goodwill is recognized in a business combination we estimate fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired similar to the goodwill assessment described above the company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if 

necessary the company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset based upon its forecasted cash flows to its carrying value other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2017  the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments 

are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we were in a net derivative asset liability position of 12 million  and 37 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because aptiv’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the aptiv plc long term incentive plan as amended and restated effective april 23 2015 “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to aptivs executives have been made under the plc ltip in each year from 2012 to 2017  and are expected to continue to be made annually the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the companys ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions that impact the performancebased vesting portion of the rsus we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the companys best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets on a straightline basis over the requisite vesting period of the awards adjusted for an estimate for forfeitures the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as differences in actual results from managements estimates could result in estimated or actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the companys future results of operations and financial condition 

modifications to the terms of sharebased awards are treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with the resulting total compensation cost equal to the grantdate fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award the calculation of the incremental value is based on the excess of the fair value of the new modified award based on current circumstances over the fair value of the original award measured immediately before its terms are modified based on current circumstances to the extent there is incremental compensation cost relating to the newly modified award it is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2017  are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of 

analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate transactional exposure we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the companys reporting currency translational exposure the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 2017  the foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 315 million  was primarily due to the impact of a weakening us dollar which decreased approximately 14 in relation to the euro and 6 in relation to the chinese yuan renminbi from december 31 2016  

as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in order to manage certain translational exposure we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes and the 2016 eurodenominated senior notes as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries we have also entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain chinese yuan renminbidenominated subsidiaries the effective portion of the gains or losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment component in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in these foreign currencydenominated operations 

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty and turkish lira as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  the net fair value liability of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 1397 million and 998 million respectively the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 156 million and 97 million at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper the net fair value of our contracts was an asset of approximately 35 million  and 11 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 19 million and 14 million at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 398 million  of floating rate debt related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 125 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 010 per annum or b libor plus 110 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 010 to 025 up to a maximum of 050 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2017

our history 

in october 2005 old delphi and certain of its united states “us” subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the “bankruptcy court” old delphis nonus subsidiaries which were not included in the chapter 11 filings continued their business operations without supervision from the bankruptcy court and were not subject to the requirements of the bankruptcy code on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of old delphi and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to old delphi general motors company “gm” and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged by its equity holders for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by increasing government regulations for vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control as well as rapidly increasing consumer demand for connectivity these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into three diversified segments which enable us to develop solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends 

 we previously reported the results of our former thermal systems business as a segment the thermal systems business provided powertrain cooling and heating ventilating and air conditioning “hvac” systems such as compressors systems and controls and heat exchangers for vehicle markets as part of our strategy to focus on a highgrowth product portfolio and as further described in note 25 discontinued operations to the audited consolidated financial statements herein we completed the sale of the wholly owned thermal systems business to mahle gmbh mahle on june 30 2015 the assets and liabilities operating results and operating and investing cash flows for the previously reported thermal systems segment are presented as discontinued operations separate from the company’s continuing operations for all periods presented our description and discussion of financial amounts within this item 1 business reflect the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

financial information about business segments 

we operate our core business along three operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

net sales by segment 



refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for further financial information about business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes all 25  of the largest automotive oems in the world and in 2016  26  of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth our ten largest platforms in 2016  were with six different oems in addition in 2016  our products were found in 18 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states in 18 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 15 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have diversified our business into the commercial vehicle market which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market in addition approximately 6 of our 2016  net sales were to the aftermarket which meets the ongoing need for replacement parts required for vehicle servicing 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from low cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2016 the industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2015 vehicle production in 2016 increased by 2  in north america 3  in europe and 15  in china as a result of persisting economic weakness in south america there was a decline of 12 in south american vehicle production in 2016 compared to 2015 which followed a 19 decrease in that region in 2015 demand for automotive components in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our automotive commercial vehicle and aftermarket customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a notice issued by the us national highway traffic safety administration which updated its fivestar rating system to include automatic emergency braking systems as a recommended safety technology beginning with model year 2018 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2016 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide co 2    emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions delphi is pioneering the electrification of internal combustion powertrains through the addition of hybrid technology which will allow for further engine downsizing 

by providing more power for intelligent driving in 2016 delphi introduced its 48volt mild hybrid vehicle solution which maximizes the use of 48volt electrification to minimize the demand on the engine improving engine performance while lowering co 2   emissions by more than 10 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive so that time in a vehicle is more productive and enjoyable the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents delphi is pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

convergence of safe green and connected solutions in autonomous driving 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co 2  emissions through optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements 

we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space for example in 2016 we entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to jointly develop the centralized sensing localization and planning cslp system a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers with the goal of being production ready for 2019 we also believe the increasing societal demand for mobility on demand mod services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the mod space for example in 2016 we entered into an agreement to develop fullyautonomous vehicles as part of an automated mod pilot for the government of singapore 

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the safe green and connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation 

products 

our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines 

electricalelectronic architecture  this segment offers complete electrical and electronic architectures for our customerspecific needs that help reduce production cost weight and mass and improve reliability and ease of assembly 

 powertrain systems  this segment offers high quality products for complete engine management systems “ems” and products to help optimize performance emissions and fuel economy 

 we also include aftermarket and original equipment service in the powertrain systems segment 

electronics and safety  this segment offers a wide range of electronic and safety equipment and software in the areas of controls security infotainment communications and safety systems 

 competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world we also sell our products to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts including the aftermarket operations of our oem customers and to other distributors and retailers the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2016  



supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  net property data is as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  





research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2016  we employed over 20000  scientists engineers and technicians around the world our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 15 billion  15 billion  and 16 billion  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively which includes approximately 300 million  300 million  and 400 million  of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 30 of engineering expenses 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks particularly those protecting the delphi brand are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2016 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our electricalelectronic architecture segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we employed approximately 145000 people 28000 salaried employees and 117000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 21000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the international union of electronic electrical 

salaried machine and furniture workers  communications workers of america iuecwa and the confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 6 million  4 million  and 5 million  respectively additionally as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations included within liabilities held for sale was approximately 0  6 million  and 16 million  respectively of which 0 0 and 7 million respectively related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to overall strong global economic conditions in 2016 the automotive industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules compared to 2015 vehicle production in 2016 increased by 2  in north america 3  in europe and 15  in china however economic uncertainties have continued to persist in south america resulting in a decline of 12 in south american vehicle production in 2016 which follows a 19 decrease in that region in 2015 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in certain regions uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and 

financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

if we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business 

the automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us there has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a long term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita these evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to oem and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2016  accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products for example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest 

customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

we have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key geographic market and have identified advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies as a key product market we believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long term growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the asia pacific region or are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the long term we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced for example automotive production in china increased 4 in 2015 as compared to 2014 which represented a reduction from the overall level of longterm automotive market growth in the country in 2016 automotive production in china increased 15  as compared to 2015 benefiting in part from a consumer vehicle tax reduction program following a partial increase in the consumer vehicle tax in 2017 vehicle production volumes in china are expected to increase by 1  in 2017 our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in low cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry 

the global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the geographic markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as active safety and automated driving which has attracted new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products if we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity 

prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues for example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to new regulations issued by the us department of transportation dot in 2016 which will require manufacturers of autonomous vehicles to provide documentation covering specific topics to regulators such as how automated systems detect objects on the road how information is displayed to drivers what cybersecurity measures are in place and the testing and validation methods used to develop the autonomous driving system in addition to these issued regulations there remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the dot or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction it is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs 

we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive 

pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions increased gasoline prices or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 521 million as of december 31 2016  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 925 million  at december 31 2016  of which 10 million  is included in accrued liabilities 923 million  is included in longterm liabilities and 8 million  is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units value is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot ensure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 64  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  came from sales outside the united states which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro chinese yuan renminbi british pound and brazilian real could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 64  of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 



additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our long term strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

the results of the referendum of the united kingdom’s membership of the european union may adversely affect our business and profitability 

the united kingdom uk held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit which resulted in increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of the referendum the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu including among other matters the terms of trade between the uk and the eu brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates the taxation policies of the uk and the eu nations in which we conduct business may also change as a result of the brexit which could adversely impact our tax positions delphi automotive plc is a uk resident taxpayer 

although we are actively monitoring the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows approximately 5 of our annual net sales are generated in the uk and approximately 3 are denominated in british pounds 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we expect to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyber attack malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 6 million  at december 31 2016  for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of polychlorinated biphenyls or storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2016  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2016  claims totaling approximately 185 million  using december 31 2016  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2016  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 30 million  using december 31 2016  foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws in particular we will seek to organize and operate ourselves in such a way that we are and remain tax resident in the united kingdom additionally in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

as of december 31 2016  we owned or leased 126  major manufacturing sites and 15  major technical centers a manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased we also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world we have a presence in 46  countries the following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities 



in addition to these manufacturing sites we had 15  major technical centers five  in north america five  in europe middle east and africa four  in asia pacific and one  in south america 

of our 126  major manufacturing sites and 15  major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 75 are primarily owned and 66 are primarily leased 

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

unsecured creditors litigation 

delphi has been subject to ongoing litigation related to general unsecured claims against the former delphi corporation now known as dphh resulting from that entitys 2005 bankruptcy filing the fourth amended and restated limited liability partnership agreement of delphi automotive llp the “fourth llp agreement” was entered into on july 12 2011 by the members of delphi automotive llp in order to position the company for its initial public offering under the terms of the fourth llp agreement if cumulative distributions to the members of delphi automotive llp under certain provisions of the fourth llp agreement exceed 72 billion  delphi as disbursing agent on behalf of dphh is required to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against dphh 3250  for every 6750  in excess of 72 billion  distributed to the members up to a maximum amount of 300 million  in december 2014 a complaint was filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court alleging that the 2011 redemption by delphi automotive llp of the membership interests of gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc totaling 44 billion and the subsequent repurchase of shares and payment of dividends by delphi automotive plc constituted distributions under the terms of the fourth llp agreement approximating 72 billion  triggering the maximum 300 million distribution to the holders of general unsecured claims 

in may 2016 the bankruptcy court initially denied both parties motions for summary judgment requiring further submissions to the bankruptcy court regarding the parties intent with respect to the redemptions of the gm and pbgc membership interests on january 12 2017 the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs ruling that the membership interest redemption payments qualified as distributions which along with share repurchases and dividend payments made by delphi count toward the 72 billion  threshold and thus the 300 million  maximum distribution for general unsecured claims has been triggered the bankruptcy court will rule on the application of prejudgment interest at a future date 

in connection with the ruling the company recorded a reserve of 300 million  in the fourth quarter of 2016 the reserve was recorded to other expense in the consolidated statement of operations and resulted in a corresponding reduction in earnings per diluted share of approximately 110  for the year ended december 31 2016 however delphi continues to consider cumulative distributions through december 31 2016 to be substantially below the 72 billion  threshold and intends to vigorously contest the ruling through the appeals process delphi filed a notice of appeal on january 26 2017 

brazil matters 

delphi conducts business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while delphi believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2016  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2016  claims totaling approximately 185 million  using december 31 2016  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2016  the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of 30 million  using december 31 2016  foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected the company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero  to 155 million

executive overview 

our business 

we are a leading global vehicle components manufacturer and provide electrical and electronic powertrain and active safety technology solutions to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets we are one of the largest vehicle component manufacturers and our customers include all 25  of the largest automotive original equipment manufacturers “oems” in the world 

business strategy 

we believe the company is wellpositioned for growth from increasing global vehicle production volumes increased demand for our safe green and connected products which are being added to vehicle content and new business wins with existing and new customers we have successfully created a competitive cost structure continued to align our product offerings with the highgrowth industry megatrends and realigned our manufacturing footprint into an efficient lowcost regional service model allowing us to increase our profit margins 

our achievements in 2016  included the following 



 our strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative marketrelevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous forwardlooking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to oems we are committed to creating value for our shareholders we repurchased 635 million  of ordinary shares in 2016  we also continued to return cash to our shareholders paying cash dividends totaling 317 million  in 2016  our key strategic priorities include 

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 15  major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in each of our product lines 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  during 2016 we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

economic conditions  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production increased 5  from 2015  to 2016  economic conditions and the resultant levels of automotive vehicle production were uneven from a regional perspective vehicle production increased by 2  in north america and 3  in europe as consumer demand for vehicles increased as a result of these economies experiencing moderate improvement in 2016 both the north american and european economies are expected to continue to experience moderate growth resulting in essentially flat vehicle production in both regions in 2017 as compared to the increased volumes experienced in 2016 automotive production in china increased by 15  in 2016 as compared to 2015 benefiting in part from a consumer vehicle tax reduction program following a partial increase in the consumer vehicle tax in 2017 vehicle production in china is expected to increase by 1  in 2017 as compared to 2016 additionally vehicle production in south america our smallest region decreased by 12  in 2016 as compared to 2015 with volumes expected to be flat in 2017 with the reduced volumes experienced in 2016 due to continued economic weakness in the region 

economic volatility or weakness in north america europe or china or continued weakness in south america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition there is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the us and other economies and specifically the automotive sector in particular changes to international trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our oem customers resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability 

there have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the united kingdom uk and europe as a result of the uk referendum held on june 23 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit as a result of the referendum the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu including among other matters the terms of trade between the uk and the eu brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates although we are actively monitoring the ongoing potential impacts of brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business any of these effects of brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows approximately 5 of our annual net sales are generated in the uk and approximately 3 are denominated in british pounds 

emerging markets growth  there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in china which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced despite these recent moderations in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other emerging markets have resulted and are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long term our strong global presence and presence in these markets has positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the long term we continue to expand our established presence in emerging markets positioning us to benefit from the expected long term growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the emerging market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the emerging markets 

we have a strong presence in china where we have operated for over 20 years including a major manufacturing base which has included investments in 6  new manufacturing facilities since 2012 all of our business segments have operations and sales in china as a result we have wellestablished relationships with all of the major oems in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china however we continue to believe there is long term growth potential in this market based on increasing long term automotive and vehicle content demand 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety fuel efficiency emissions control electrification high speed data connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies our electricalelectronic architecture and electronics and safety segments are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content software and electrification requiring a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology in 2016 we introduced our 48volt mild hybrid vehicle solution which maximizes the use of 48volt electrification to minimize the demand on the engine improving performance while lowering co 2 emissions by more than 10 additionally our powertrain systems segment is also focused on addressing the demand for increased fuel efficiency and emission control through products such as gasoline direct injection gdi fuel systems and variable valve actuation technology such as dynamic skip fire software 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to low cost locations within these regions 

our global operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or tax fiscal policy including tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers existing free trade laws and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as china and mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally and is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for hightechnology content in automobiles 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of more than 20000  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15  major technical centers in brazil china france germany india luxembourg mexico poland south korea the united kingdom and the united states we invest approximately 15 billion  which includes approximately 300 million  coinvestment by customers and government agencies annually in research and 

development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and ownedheld approximately 8500 patents and protective rights as of december 31 2016  we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions for example in 2016 we entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to jointly develop a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers with the goal of being production ready for 2019 our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 300 million  annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 95  of our hourly workforce is located in low cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 14  of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2016  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to low cost locations in europe and on reducing our global overhead costs as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2016  results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 40 billion  and substantial available liquidity of approximately 32 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility and committed european accounts receivable factoring facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2016  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems has increased above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes and have not experienced any significant impacts to date as a result of the recalls that have been initiated it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

in september 2016 general motors company gm our largest customer initiated a recall of approximately 364 million vehicles in the united states to enhance the airbag deployment system delphi supplied sensors and related control modules for the airbags in the affected vehicles in compliance with gms product specifications and validation criteria we have assisted with gms implementation efforts surrounding its recall and have recorded our best estimate of our obligations related to this matter although we can provide no assurances we do not expect the cost of this matter to be material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally additionally new entrants from outside the traditional automotive industry may seek to gain access to certain vehicle component markets as evidenced by the proposed acquisition of harman international industries incorporated by samsung electronics co ltd announced in november 2016 we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend as further described below on december 18 2015  we completed the acquisition of hellermanntyton group plc hellermanntyton a leading global manufacturer of highperformance and innovative cable management solutions which expands our product portfolio within the connected vehicle solutions market and will help us capitalize on the connected car megatrend given the timing of the acquisition it is not fully reflected in our 2015 results and impacts comparability to 2016 results 

evolution of the automotive industry  the automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of hightechnology softwaredependent components and solutions in particular the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long term growth for our product offerings in this space we are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our multidomain controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions we have also entered into a collaborative arrangement with mobileye nv to jointly develop a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our oem customers with the goal of being production ready for 2019 there has also been increasing societal demand for mobility on demand mod services such as car and ridesharing and an increasing number of traditional automotive companies have made investments in the mod space we believe the increasing societal demand for mod services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the mod space we recently entered into an agreement to develop fullyautonomous vehicles as part of an automated mod pilot for the government of singapore as a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas 

however there are many risks associated with these evolving areas including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and new and emerging regulations such as the recently introduced autonomous vehicle guidelines published by the us department of transportation while we believe we are wellpositioned in these markets the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of old delphi “the acquisition” which along with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of old delphi and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to old delphi general motors company gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares by its equity holders in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

consolidated results of operations 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2016  were 167 billion  an increase of 10  compared to 2015  this compares to total global oem production increases of 5  in 2016  the increase in our total net sales is primarily attributable to continued increased volumes in the north america europe and asia pacific regions as well as incremental sales as a result of our acquisition of hellermanntyton in december 2015 partially offsetting these increased volumes were reduced sales in our smallest region south america due to continuing economic weakness resulting in continued reductions in oem production schedules in the region our overall lean cost structure along with abovemarket sales growth in north america 

europe and asia pacific enabled us to improve gross margins in the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the prior year 

the decrease in our total net sales of 2  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign currency impacts which offset increased sales volumes in north america europe and asia pacific partially offsetting these increases were reduced sales volumes in our smallest region south america due to continuing economic weakness resulting in continued reductions in oem production schedules in the region 

delphi typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities and issuance of longterm debt to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 08 billion  and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 31 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 20 billion revolving credit facility and the €400 million european accounts receivable factoring facility of which €350 million is available on a committed basis as described below 

the following table summarizes our available liquidity which includes cash cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities as of december 31 2016  the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s significant committed credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants which are described below 



1 availability reduced by 7 million  in letters of credit issued under the credit agreement as of december 31 2016  

2 based on december 31 2016  foreign currency rates subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable 

we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on ordinary shares and capital expenditures in addition we expect to continue to repurchase outstanding common shares pursuant to our authorized common share repurchase program as further described below 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement while a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our nonus subsidiaries and as of december 31 2016  the companys cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled 799 million we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to delphi if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate such funds however based on our current liquidity needs and repatriation strategies we do not anticipate a need to repatriate such additional amounts additionally the company is a uk resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings as a result we do not anticipate foreign earnings would be subject to a 35  tax rate upon repatriation to the uk as is the case when us based companies repatriate earnings to the us for further information regarding undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries see note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2017 and beyond

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 6 million  of which 1 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 5 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 4 million  of which 1 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 3 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities additionally as of december 31 2015  approximately 6 million  of undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations was included within liabilities held for sale delphi cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in fasb asc 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill in addition an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component such as our acquisition agreements for antaya ottomatika and controltec the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations and product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

delphi does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2016  2015  or 2014  the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2016   

expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 575  and 750  for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of approximately 50  of our plan assets is actual fair value the expected return on the remainder of our plan assets is determined by applying the expected longterm rate of return on assets to a calculated marketrelated value of these plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of the plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 

effective january 1 2016 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans that utilize a yield curve approach historically the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period the company elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows the company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly accounted for it on a prospective basis the reduction in service and interest costs associated with this change in estimate for the year ended december 31 2016 was less than 10 million  

our pension expense for 2017 is determined at the december 31 2016  measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the 

projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the companys share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we estimate implied  fair value of goodwill in the same way as goodwill is recognized in a business combination we estimate fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired similar to the goodwill assessment described above the company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if necessary the company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair of the asset based upon its forecasted cash flows to its carrying value other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2016  the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the 

deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we were in a net derivative liability position of 37 million  and 129 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because delphi’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the delphi automotive plc long term incentive plan as amended and restated effective april 23 2015 “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to delphis executives have been made under the plc ltip in each year from 2012 to 2016  and are expected to continue to be made annually the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the companys ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions that impact the performancebased vesting portion of the rsus we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the companys best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets on a straightline basis over the requisite vesting period of the awards adjusted for an estimate for forfeitures the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as 

differences in actual results from managements estimates could result in estimated or actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the companys future results of operations and financial condition 

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2016  are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices currently we do not have any options or instruments with nonlinear returns 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate transactional exposure we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the companys reporting currency translational exposure the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31 2016  the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 147 million  was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 4 in relation to the euro 6 in relation to the chinese yuan renminbi and 17 in relation to the british pound from december 31 2015  

as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in order to manage certain translational exposure we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes and the 2016 eurodenominated senior notes as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries we have also entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain chinese yuan renminbidenominated subsidiaries the effective portion of the gains or losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges are recognized within the cumulative translation adjustment component in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in these foreign currencydenominated operations 

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty turkish lira and hungarian forint as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the net fair value liability of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 910 million and 320 million respectively the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial 

instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 87 million and 38 million at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper the net fair value of our contracts was an asset liability of approximately 11 million  and 51 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 14 million and 15 million at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 400 million  of floating rate debt principally related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option on tranche a term loan borrowings of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 125 per annum and on revolving credit facility borrowings of either a the abr plus 010 per annum or b libor plus 110 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 010 to 025 up to a maximum of 050 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2016

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by increasing government regulations for vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control as well as rapidly increasing consumer demand for connectivity these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into three diversified segments which enable us to develop solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends 

 we previously reported the results of our former thermal systems business as a segment the thermal systems business provided powertrain cooling and heating ventilating and air conditioning “hvac” systems such as compressors systems and controls and heat exchangers for vehicle markets as part of our strategy to focus on a highgrowth product portfolio and as further described in note 25 discontinued operations to the audited consolidated financial statements herein we completed the sale of the wholly owned thermal systems business to mahle gmbh mahle on june 30 2015 the assets and liabilities operating results and operating and investing cash flows for the previously reported thermal systems segment are presented as discontinued operations separate from the company’s continuing operations for all periods presented our description and discussion of financial amounts within this item 1 business reflect the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 

financial information about business segments 

we operate our core business along three operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

net sales by segment 



refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for further financial information about business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes all 25  of the largest automotive oems in the world and in 2015 25  of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth our ten largest platforms in 2015 were with five different oems in addition in 2015 our products were found in 18 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 18 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have diversified our business into the commercial vehicle market which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market in addition approximately 6 of our 2015 net sales were to the aftermarket which meets the ongoing need for replacement parts required for vehicle servicing 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from low cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2014 and 2015 the industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules while the north american and european economies strengthened in 2015 resulting in increased vehicle production in these regions there has been a recent moderation in the level of economic growth and an increase in market volatility in china which has resulted in lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced additionally economic uncertainties have continued to persist in south america resulting in a decline of 19 in south american vehicle production in 2015 which follows a 17 decrease in that region in 2014 demand for automotive parts in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our automotive commercial vehicle and aftermarket customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a notice issued by the us national highway traffic safety administration which updated its fivestar rating system to include automatic emergency braking systems as a recommended safety technology beginning with model year 2018 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2016 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide co 2  emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are 

also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive so that time in a vehicle is more productive and enjoyable the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents delphi is pioneering vehicletovehicle v2v and vehicletoinfrastructure v2i communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

the combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of a fully automated driving experience we expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in co2 emissions through optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased interconnects we believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements 

to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within these megatrends we established utilize and benefit from our technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation 

products 

our organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines 

electricalelectronic architecture  this segment offers complete electrical and electronic architectures for our customerspecific needs that help reduce production cost weight and mass and improve reliability and ease of assembly 

 7 

product lines scope and customer base were enhanced by our acquisition of hellermanntyton group plc hellermanntyton on december 18 2015 as further described below 

 powertrain systems  this segment offers high quality products for complete engine management systems “ems” and products to help optimize performance emissions and fuel economy 

 we also include aftermarket and original equipment service in the powertrain systems segment 

electronics and safety  this segment offers a wide range of electronic and safety equipment and software in the areas of controls security infotainment communications safety systems and power electronics 

 competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world we also sell our products to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts including the aftermarket operations of our oem customers and to other distributors and retailers the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2015  



supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved 

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  net property data is as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013

research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2015  we employed over 19000  scientists engineers and technicians around the world our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 15 billion  16 billion  and 16 billion  or the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively which includes approximately 300 million  400 million  and 400 million  of coinvestment by customers and government agencies each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 30 of engineering expenses 

we utilize a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks particularly those protecting the delphi brand are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins as of december 31 2015 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our electricalelectronic architecture segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 139000 people 5000 in the us and 134000 outside of the us 27000 salaried employees and 112000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 34000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including 

the iuecwa and the confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  5 million  and 6 million  respectively additionally as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations included within liabilities held for sale was approximately 6 million  16 million  and 15 million  respectively of which 0 million 7 million and 7 million respectively related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows while the north american and european economies strengthened in 2015  resulting in increased vehicle production in these regions there has been a recent moderation in the level of economic growth and an increase in market volatility in china which has resulted in lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced although automotive production in china increased by 4  in 2015 as compared to 2014 this represents a reduction from the overall level of longterm automotive market growth in the country additionally vehicle production in south america decreased by 19  in 2015 as compared to 2014 which follows a 17 decrease in that region in 2014 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from oem customers in these regions a prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations continued uncertainty relating to the economic conditions in china or south america may continue to have an adverse impact on our business if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2015  accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

we have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key market likely to experience substantial growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous 

manufacturing operations technical centers and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in those regions if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in this region we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase over the long term we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share additionally there has been a recent moderation in the level of economic growth and an increase in market volatility in china which has resulted in lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced although automotive production in china increased by 4  in 2015 as compared to 2014 and is expected to increase by an additional 4  in 2016 this represents a reduction from the overall level of longterm automotive market growth in the country our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in low cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry 

the global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could 

be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including in the case of automotive sales increased gasoline prices or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles using alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 418 million as of december 31 2015  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 823 million  at december 31 2015  of which 11 million  is included in accrued liabilities 814 million  is included in longterm liabilities and 2 million  is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units value is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot ensure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 63  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  came from sales outside the united states which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the euro chinese yuan renminbi british pound and brazilian real could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not 

have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico china and other countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 63  of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 

 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our long term strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we expect to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyber attack malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we 

are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

 22 

we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million  at december 31 2015  for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of polychlorinated biphenyls or storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2015  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2015  claims totaling approximately 135 million  using december 31 2015  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2015  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 23 million  using december 31 2015  foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a 

number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unsuccessful in contesting the irs’ s assertion that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes there could be a material impact on our future tax liability 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc delphi automotive plc is a uk resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings 

delphi automotive llp which acquired certain assets in a bankruptcy court approved transaction the bankruptcy plan on october 6 2009 the acquisition date was established on august 19 2009 as a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of england and wales at the time of its formation delphi automotive llp elected to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes on june 24 2014 the internal revenue service the “irs” issued us a notice of proposed adjustment the nopa asserting that it believes section 7874b of the internal revenue code applied to delphi automotive llp and that it should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes retroactive to the acquisition date if delphi automotive llp was treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company also expected that although delphi automotive plc is incorporated under the laws of jersey and a tax resident in the uk it would also have been treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes if delphi automotive llp and delphi automotive plc were treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes we would have been subject to us federal income tax on our worldwide taxable income 

delphi automotive llp filed us federal partnership tax returns for 2009 2010 and 2011 the irs’s nopa asserts that section 7874b applies to delphi automotive llp’s acquisition of certain assets pursuant to the bankruptcy plan and consequently delphi automotive llp should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes notwithstanding the issuance of the nopa we continue to believe after consultation with counsel that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we intend to vigorously contest the conclusions reached in the nopa through the irs’s administrative appeals process and if we are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs through litigation accordingly we will continue to prepare and file our financial statements on the basis that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc is a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we have not recorded any adjustments with respect to this matter nor have we recorded any adjustments in connection with receiving the nopa however while we believe that we should prevail no assurance can be given that we will be able to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs or that if we were to litigate a court will agree with our position further the ultimate resolution of this issue could take significant time and resources 

if these entities are treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes the company will be subject to us federal income tax on its worldwide taxable income including distributions as well as deemed income inclusions from some of its nonus subsidiaries this could have a material adverse impact on our income tax liability as a us company any dividends we pay to nonus shareholders could also be subject to us federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 unless reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty and it is possible that tax may be withheld on such dividends in certain circumstances even before a final determination has been made with respect to the companys us income tax status in addition we could be liable for the failure by delphi automotive llp to withhold us federal income taxes on distributions to its nonus members for periods beginning on or after the acquisition date if we are unsuccessful in contesting the irs’s assertion we expect any unfavorable final outcome to adversely impact our tax position by increasing our longterm effective tax rate to approximately 20  to 22  for the year ended december 31 2015  our effective tax rate was 17  

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws in particular we will seek to organize and operate ourselves in such a way that we are and remain tax resident in the united kingdom while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we believe the company is wellpositioned for growth from increasing global vehicle production volumes increased demand for our safe green and connected products which are being added to vehicle content and new business wins with existing and new customers we have successfully created a competitive cost structure continued to align our product offerings with the highgrowth industry megatrends and realigned our manufacturing footprint into an efficient lowcost regional service model allowing us to increase our profit margins 

our achievements in 2015  included the following 

 32 

 our strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative marketrelevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous forwardlooking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to oems we are committed to creating value for our shareholders we expanded our repurchases of ordinary shares in 2015 to 12 billion  in 2015 we also continued to return cash to our shareholders paying cash dividends totaling 286 million  our key strategic priorities include 

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 14  major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in each of our product lines 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the 

appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments  in 2015 we completed the acquisition of hellermanntyton a leading global manufacturer of highperformance and innovative cable management solutions this acquisition enhances our position as a leading supplier of automotive electricalelectronic architecture and expands our product portfolio within the connected vehicle solutions market we also completed other selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

rate of economic recovery  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production increased 2  from 2014  to 2015  and is expected to increase by an additional 2  in 2016 the economic recovery has remained uneven from a regional perspective vehicle production increased by 4  in both north america and europe as consumer demand for vehicles increased as a result of these economies strengthening in 2015 both the north american and european economies are expected to continue to experience moderate improvement resulting in vehicle production growth of 3  in north america and 2  in europe in 2016 as compared to 2015 however despite the continuing strengthening in north america and europe there has been a recent moderation in the level of economic growth and an increase in market volatility in china which has resulted in lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced as a result of this volatility in china there was a significant reduction in vehicle production during the third quarter of 2015 however production recovered strongly in the fourth quarter of 2015 although automotive production in china increased by 4  for the full year of 2015 as compared to 2014 and is expected to increase by an additional 4  in 2016 this represents a reduction from the overall level of longterm automotive market growth in the country additionally vehicle production in south america our smallest region decreased by 19  in 2015 as compared to 2014 and is expected to decrease by an additional 10  in 2016 

economic volatility in china continued weakness in south america or weakness in europe or north america could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts to vehicles with less content would adversely impact our profitability 

emerging markets growth  despite the recent moderation in the level of economic growth in china rising income levels in china and other emerging markets have resulted and are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long term our strong global presence and presence in these markets have positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates over the long term we continue to expand our established presence in emerging markets positioning us to benefit from the expected continued long term growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the emerging market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the emerging markets 

we have a strong presence in china where we have operated for over 20 years including a major manufacturing base which has included investments in 6  new manufacturing facilities since 2012 all of our business segments have operations and sales in china as a result we have wellestablished relationships with all of the major oems in china our business in china remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in china and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in china however we continue to believe there is long term growth potential in this market based on increasing long term automotive and vehicle content demand 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ need to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content related to safety fuel efficiency emissions control automated features 

and connectivity to the global information network our electricalelectronic architecture and electronics and safety segments are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content and electrification requiring a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as hybrid power electronics automated advanced driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated vehicle cockpit displays navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ need to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology additionally our powertrain systems segment is also focused on addressing the demand for increased fuel efficiency and emission control through products such as gasoline direct injection gdi fuel systems 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to low cost locations within these regions 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of more than 19000  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 14  major technical centers in brazil china france germany india luxembourg mexico poland south korea the united kingdom and the united states we invest approximately 15 billion  which includes approximately 300 million  coinvestment by customers and government agencies annually in research and development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and ownedheld approximately 8500 patents and protective rights as of december 31 2015  we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 300 million  annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable despite decreases in industry volumes and at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle we believe that our lean cost structure will allow us to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 95 of our hourly workforce is located in low cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 23 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2015  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in 

response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on aligning our manufacturing capacity and footprint with the current automotive production levels in europe and south america and the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to low cost locations within these regions as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2015  results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 40 billion  and substantial liquidity of approximately 20 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2015  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  there was a significant increase in the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems in 2014 and 2015 in the us a record number of vehicle recalls were initiated in 2014 and recalls in 2015 continued to remain above historical levels these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future additionally in 2015 our secondlargest customer volkswagen group “vw” initiated a process to recall certain diesel vehicles that were found to violate vehicle emissions standards although we supplied engine controllers for a limited number of affected vehicles manufactured and sold outside of north america we do not currently expect any adverse impacts directly resulting from this matter however we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes and have not experienced any significant impacts to date as a result of the recalls that have been initiated it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend as further described below on december 18 2015  we completed the acquisition of hellermanntyton a leading global manufacturer of highperformance and innovative cable management solutions which expands our product portfolio within the connected vehicle solutions market and will help us capitalize on the connected car megatrend we are integrating hellermanntyton into our electricalelectronic architecture segment given the timing of the acquisition it is not fully reflected in our 2015 results 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of old delphi “the acquisition” which along with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of old delphi and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to old delphi general motors company gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares by its equity holders in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

consolidated results of operations 

in 2015  total global oem production volumes increased 2  from 2014  although total global oem production volumes increased indicating continued stabilization of the global economy the economic recovery has remained uneven from a regional perspective while the north american and european economies strengthened in 2015  resulting in increased vehicle production in these regions there has been a recent moderation in the level of economic growth and an increase in market volatility in china which has resulted in lower automotive production growth rates in china than those previously experienced although automotive production in china increased by 4  in 2015 as compared to 2014 this represents a reduction from the overall level of longterm automotive market growth in the country additionally vehicle production in south america decreased by 19  in 2015 as compared to 2014 which follows a 17 decrease in that region in 2014 

in light of the economic uncertainties and reductions to vehicle production in certain regions we have initiated restructuring actions as appropriate in order to align our manufacturing capacity and footprint with the current automotive production levels and to continue the rotation of our manufacturing footprint to low cost locations as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure however we believe our strong balance sheet coupled with our flexible cost structure will position us to capitalize on any strengthening of the global economy and improvements in oem production volumes 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2015  were 152 billion  a decrease of 2  compared to 2014  this compares to total global oem production increases of 2  in 2015  the decrease in our total net sales is primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign currency impacts which offset increased sales volumes in north america europe and asia pacific partially offsetting these increases were reduced sales volumes in our smallest region south america due to continuing economic weakness resulting in continued reductions in oem production schedules in the region our overall lean cost structure along with abovemarket sales growth in north america europe and asia pacific enabled us to improve gross margins in the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the prior year 

the increase in our total net sales of 3  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  was attributable to increased sales in north america and asia pacific although our net sales in europe also increased modestly in 2014 our sales continued to be impacted by persistent economic uncertainties in the region which resulted in limited growth in oem production in 2014 partially offsetting these increases were reduced sales in south america due to continuing economic weakness which resulted in reductions in oem production schedules in the region 

delphi typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

2015  versus 2014 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2015  versus december 31 2014

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary cash provided by issuance of longterm debt and borrowings under available credit facilities to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents of 05 billion  and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 35 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 15 billion revolving credit facility and the €400 million european accounts receivable factoring facility described below both of which were undrawn as of december 31 2015  we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on ordinary shares and capital expenditures in addition we expect to continue to repurchase outstanding common shares pursuant to our authorized common share repurchase programs as further described below 

we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement while a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our nonus subsidiaries and as of december 31 2015  the companys cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries totaled 506 million we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to delphi if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate such funds however based on our current liquidity needs and repatriation strategies we do not anticipate a need to repatriate such additional amounts additionally the company is a uk resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings as a result we do not anticipate foreign earnings would be subject to a 35  tax rate upon repatriation to the uk as is the case when us based companies repatriate earnings to the us for further information regarding undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries see note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2016 and beyond

benefit expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans 3 a sensitivity analysis of potential changes to pension obligations and expense that would result from changes in key assumptions and 4 funding obligations 

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  of which 1 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 3 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 5 million  of which 1 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 4 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities additionally approximately 6 million  and 16 million  as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively of undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations was included within liabilities held for sale delphi cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in fasb asc 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill in addition an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component such as our acquisition agreements for antaya ottomatika and controltec the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary 

purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations  product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 

1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

delphi does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2015  2014  or 2013  the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2015  expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 625  and 750  for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of approximately 50  of our plan assets is actual fair value the expected return on the remainder of our plan assets is determined by applying the expected longterm rate of return on assets to a calculated marketrelated value of these plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of the plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 

our pension expense for 2016 is determined at the december 31 2015 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definitelived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates assumptions and judgments including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions financial performance of the company reporting unit specific events and changes in the companys share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and if possible a comparable market transaction model estimating fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we estimate implied  fair value of goodwill in the same way as goodwill is recognized in a business combination we estimate fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

we review indefinitelived intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired the company does not perform a qualitative assessment step 0 for indefinitelived intangible assets but performs a quantitative review based upon forecasted cash flows similar to goodwill as described above on at least an annual basis other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as described above 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2015  the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net 

derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we were in a net derivative liability position of 129 million  and 104 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because delphi’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the delphi automotive plc long term incentive plan as amended and restated effective april 23 2015 “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to delphis executives were made under the plc ltip in 2015  2014  and 2013  and are expected to be made annually the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the companys ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions that impact the performancebased vesting portion of the rsus we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the companys best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets on a straightline basis over the requisite vesting period of the awards adjusted for an estimate for forfeitures the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as differences in actual results from managements estimates could result in estimated or actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the companys future results of operations and financial condition 

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2015  are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices currently we do not have any options or instruments with nonlinear returns 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local functional currencies in which we operate transactional exposure we also have currency exposures related to the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency into us dollars the companys reporting currency translational exposure as described in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we have designated the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes as a net investment hedge of the foreign currency exposure of our investments in certain eurodenominated subsidiaries the impact of translational exposure is recorded within currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with fluctuations in the value of the 2015 eurodenominated senior notes due to exchange rate changes offsetting changes in the value of our net investment of these eurodenominated operations during the year ended december 31 2015  the foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 344 million  was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening us dollar which increased approximately 10 in relation to the euro from december 31 2014  

in some instances we choose to reduce our transactional exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant hedged currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty turkish lira and hungarian forint as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the net fair value asset of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 320 million and 688 million respectively the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 38 million and 175 million at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components primarily copper as a result of the divestiture of our thermal systems business in 2015 as further described in note 25 discontinued operations to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we no longer have significant exposure to aluminum and as such no longer enter into derivative transactions for this commodity the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximately 51 million  and 27 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 15 million and 35 million at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations we do not use interest rate swap or other derivative contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 400 million  of floating rate debt principally related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option of either a the abr plus 000 per annum or b libor plus 100 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 025 to 050 up to a maximum of 10 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2015

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by increasing government regulations for vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control as well as rapidly increasing consumer demand for connectivity these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into four diversified segments which enable us to develop solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends

 financial information about business segments 

we operate our core business along four operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

net sales by segment 



refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for further financial information about business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes all 25  of the largest automotive oems in the world and in 2014 23  of our net sales came from the asia pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial growth our eight largest platforms in 2014 were with five different oems in addition in 2014 our products were found in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states in 18 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 17 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have diversified our business into the commercial vehicle market which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market in addition approximately 6 of our 2014 net sales were to the aftermarket which meets the ongoing need for replacement parts required for vehicle servicing 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from low cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2013 and 2014 the industry saw increased global customer sales and production schedules however while oem vehicle production in north america and asia pacific has continued to grow production in europe and south america continues to be impacted by the economic uncertainties in these regions vehicle production increased by only 2  in europe and decreased by 17  in south america in 2014 as compared to 2013 demand for automotive parts in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in 

global markets we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our automotive commercial vehicle and aftermarket customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a recent regulation issued by the us national highway traffic safety administration that will require rear view cameras in all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of less than 10000 pounds that are manufactured on or after may 1 2018 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2016 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in co 2  emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve thermal management engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive so that time in a vehicle is more productive and enjoyable the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving also with increased smart phone usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents delphis myfi suite of infotainment products seamlessly integrate smart phones with vehicles allowing greater connectivity to the devices and cloud based content and services delphis myfi then couples active safety products to monitor the environment inside and outside the vehicle to help enable connectivity in a safer environment coupled with alerts audio commands and responses driver awareness can be enhanced and increased connectivity enabled 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance we have formed a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders to guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within these megatrends 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation

 competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 



customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world we also sell our products to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts including the aftermarket operations of our oem customers and to other distributors and retailers the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2014 



supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the timeframe involved 

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 net property data is as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 



 research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2014 we employed over 20000  scientists engineers and technicians around the world total expenditures for research and development activities which include engineering were approximately 13 billion  13 billion  and 12 billion  for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 30 of engineering expenses 

we have formed a technology advisory council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for engineering activities to be approximately 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks particularly those protecting the delphi brand are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include aluminum copper and resins as of december 31 2014 we have not 

experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper aluminum petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our electricalelectronic architecture segment and aluminum which primarily affects our thermal segment contract escalation clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper and aluminum our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 127000 people 5000 in the us and 122000 outside of the us 26000 salaried employees and 101000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 37000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the iuecwa the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union and its local union 87l together the “usw” and confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa and the usw with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 the reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 21 million  21 million  and 21 million  respectively of which 7 million 7 million and 8 million respectively related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows automakers across europe and south america are continuing to experience difficulties as economic uncertainties persist in these regions oem vehicle production in europe increased by 2  from 2013 to 2014 following essentially flat production in 2013 as compared to 2012 production in south america decreased by 17  in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from these oem customers a prolonged downturn in the european or south american automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations continued uncertainty relating to the economic conditions in europe or south america may continue to have an adverse impact on our business if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and 

financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 44 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2014  accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

we have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key market likely to experience substantial growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in those regions if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in this region we may not only fail to realize expected 

rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper aluminum and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in low cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a 

significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry 

the global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china and by the anticipated global economic recovery we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs and political social and economic instability 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including in the case of automotive sales increased gasoline prices or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles using alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 466 million as of december 31 2014  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 974 million  at december 31 2014  of which 19 million  is included in accrued liabilities and 955 million  is included in longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting 

units value is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot assure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 67  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  came from sales outside the united states which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico and countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2014  approximately 67  of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 

 19 

 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we expect to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers and redundant infrastructure a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we are subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities in the us and abroad the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 21 million  at december 31 2014  for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of polychlorinated biphenyls or storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2014  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2014  claims totaling approximately 180 million  using december 31 2014  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2014  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 32 million  using december 31 2014  foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unsuccessful in contesting the irs’ s assertion that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes there could be a material impact on our future tax liability 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc delphi automotive plc is a uk resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings 

delphi automotive llp which acquired certain assets in a bankruptcy court approved transaction the bankruptcy plan on october 6 2009 the acquisition date was established on august 19 2009 as a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of england and wales at the time of its formation delphi automotive llp elected to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes on june 24 2014 the internal revenue service the “irs” issued us a notice of proposed adjustment the nopa asserting that it believes section 7874b of the internal revenue code applies to delphi automotive llp and that it should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes retroactive to the acquisition date if delphi automotive llp is treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company expects that although delphi automotive plc is incorporated under the laws of jersey and a tax resident in the uk it would also be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

delphi automotive llp filed us federal partnership tax returns for 2009 2010 and 2011 the irs’s nopa asserts that section 7874b applies to delphi automotive llp’s acquisition of certain assets pursuant to the bankruptcy plan and consequently delphi automotive llp should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes notwithstanding the issuance of the nopa we continue to believe after consultation with counsel that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we intend to vigorously contest the conclusions reached in the nopa through the irs’s administrative appeals process and if we are unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs through litigation accordingly we will continue to prepare and file our financial statements on the basis that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc is a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we have not recorded any adjustments with respect to this matter nor have we recorded any adjustments in connection with receiving the nopa however while we believe that we should prevail no assurance can be given that we will be able to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs or that if we were to litigate a court will agree with our position further the ultimate resolution of this issue could take significant time and resources 

if these entities are treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes the company will be subject to us federal income tax on its worldwide taxable income including distributions as well as deemed income inclusions from some of its nonus subsidiaries this could have a material adverse impact on our income tax liability in the future as a us company any dividends we pay to nonus shareholders could also be subject to us federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 unless reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty and it is possible that tax may be withheld on such dividends in certain circumstances even before a final determination has been made with respect to the companys us income tax status in addition we could be liable for the failure by delphi automotive llp to withhold us federal income taxes on distributions to its nonus members for periods beginning on or after the acquisition date if we are unsuccessful in contesting the irs’s assertion we expect any unfavorable final outcome to adversely impact our tax position most significantly in future periods by increasing our effective tax rate to approximately 20  to 22  for the year ended december 31 2014  our effective tax rate was 17  

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws in particular we will seek to run ourselves in such a way that we are and remain tax resident in the united kingdom while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

we have no unresolved sec staff comments to report 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2014  we owned or leased 129  major manufacturing sites and 15  major technical centers in 33  countries a manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased we also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world the following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities 



in addition to these manufacturing sites we had 15  major technical centers five  in north america five  in europe middle east and africa four  in asia pacific and one  in south america 

of our 129  major manufacturing sites and 15  major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 83 are primarily owned and 61 are primarily leased 

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

gm ignition switch recall 

in the first quarter of 2014 gm delphi’s largest customer initiated a product recall related to ignition switches delphi has received requests for information from and is cooperating with various government agencies related to this ignition switch recall in addition delphi has been named as a codefendant along with gm and in certain cases other parties in product liability and class action lawsuits related to this matter during the second quarter of 2014 all of the class action cases were transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the “district court” for coordinated pretrial proceedings two consolidated amended class action complaints were filed in the district court on october 14 2014 delphi was not named as a defendant in either complaint delphi believes the allegations contained in the product liability cases are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them although no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these or any other future claims delphi does not believe a loss is probable and accordingly no  reserve has been made as of december 31 2014  

unsecured creditors litigation 

under the terms of the fourth amended and restated limited liability partnership agreement of delphi automotive llp the “fourth llp agreement” if cumulative distributions to the members of delphi automotive llp under certain provisions of the fourth llp agreement exceed 72 billion  delphi as disbursing agent on behalf of dphh is required to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against old delphi 3250  for every 6750  in excess of 72 billion  distributed to the members up to a maximum amount of 300 million  in december 2014 a complaint was filed in the bankruptcy court alleging that the redemption by delphi automotive llp of the membership interests of gm and the pbgc and the repurchase of shares and payment of dividends by delphi automotive plc constituted distributions under the terms of the fourth llp agreement approximating 72 billion  delphi considers cumulative distributions through december 31 2014  to be substantially below the 72 billion  threshold and intends to vigorously contest the allegations set forth in the complaint accordingly no  accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2014 

brazil matters 

delphi conducts significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while delphi believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2014  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2014  claims totaling approximately 180 million  using december 31 2014  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2014  the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of 32 million  using december 31 2014  foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected 

other matters 

in 2014 delphi identified certain payments immaterial in amount made by certain manufacturing facility employees in china that may violate certain provisions of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” under the oversight of delphi’s audit committee of the board of directors delphi engaged outside counsel and forensic auditors to assist in a review of these matters and to evaluate existing controls and compliance policies and procedures delphi has undertaken additional compliance training and additional compliance audits to reinforce its existing compliance programs violations of the fcpa could result in criminal andor civil liabilities and other forms of penalties or sanctions delphi has voluntarily disclosed these matters to the us department of justice and the sec and is cooperating fully with these agencies although delphi does not expect the outcome of this review to have a material adverse impact on the company there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters at this time

targeting the right business with the right customers  we intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined abovemarket growth we conduct indepth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful collaboration with customers in our 15  major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs as more oems design vehicles for global platforms where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market 

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in each of our product lines 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic alliances  in 2014 we completed the acquisitions of unwired holdings inc a media connectivity module supplier to the global automotive industry and antaya technologies corporation a leading manufacturer of onglass connectors to the global automotive industry these acquisitions enhance our position as a leading supplier of automotive electricalelectronic architecture and expand our portfolio of product offerings in the highgrowth automotive electrical connectors business we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our product offerings customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

rate of economic recovery  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including global and regional economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production increased 2  from 2013 to 2014  and is expected to increase by an additional 1 to 2  in 2015 the economic recovery has been uneven from a regional perspective while the north american and certain asia pacific economies have continued to strengthen in 2014 economic uncertainties continue to persist in europe and south america resulting in lower consumer demand for vehicles in those markets as compared to north america vehicle production increased by only 2  in europe and decreased by 17  in south america in 2014 as compared to 2013 and is expected to increase by 1  in europe in 2015 as compared to 2014 and remain essentially flat  with 2014s reduced volumes in south america continued economic weakness in europe or south america or weakness in north america or asia pacific could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts to vehicles with less content would adversely impact our profitability 

emerging markets growth  rising income levels in the emerging markets principally china are resulting in stronger growth rates in these markets our strong global presence and presence in these markets have positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates we continue to expand our established presence in emerging markets positioning us to benefit from the expected growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the emerging market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the emerging markets 

we have a strong presence in china where we have operated for over 20 years all of our business segments have operations and sales in china as a result we have wellestablished relationships with all of the major oems in china we have expanded the number of our 33 offered products locally manufactured in china to 25 in 2014  we believe we have the opportunity to expand additional product lines into china in the future as well as continuing to grow our existing localized product lines and as a result we see further growth potential in this market 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ need to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content related to safety fuel efficiency emissions control automated features and connectivity to the global information network our electricalelectronic architecture and electronics and safety segments are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content and electrification requiring a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as hybrid power electronics automated driver assistance technologies electrical vehicle monitoring active safety systems lane departure warning systems integrated electronic displays navigation systems and consumer electronics our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ need to reduce emissions while continuing to meet the demands of consumers additionally our powertrain systems and thermal systems segments are also focused on addressing the demand for increased fuel efficiency and emission control through products such as gasoline direct injection gdi fuel systems and brushless fuel pumps 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of more than 20000  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15  major technical centers in brazil china france germany india luxembourg mexico poland south korea the united kingdom and the united states we invest approximately 17 billion which includes approximately 400 million coinvestment by customers and government agencies annually in research and development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and ownedheld approximately 8000 patents and protective rights as of december 31 2014  we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 400 million annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable despite decreases in industry volumes and at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle we believe that our lean cost structure will allow us to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 94 of our hourly workforce is located in low cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 26 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2014  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and manufacturing footprint in response to continued economic uncertainties as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on aligning our manufacturing capacity and footprint with the current automotive production levels in europe and south america as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2014  results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 42 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 25 billion  and substantial liquidity of approximately 24 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2014  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

oem product recalls  there has been a significant increase in the number of vehicles recalled globally by oems in 2014 in the us a record number of vehicle recalls were initiated in 2014 these recalls can either be initiated by the oems or influenced by regulatory agencies although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the us as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry including increased focus from regulators and consumers we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes and have not experienced any significant impacts to date as a result of the recalls that have been initiated it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are 

long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of old delphi “the acquisition” which along with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of old delphi and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to old delphi general motors company gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares by its equity holders in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

consolidated results of operations 

in 2014  total global oem production volumes increased 2  from 2013 although total global oem production volumes increased indicating continued stabilization of the global economy the economic recovery was uneven from a regional perspective while oem vehicle production increased by 6  in china and 5  in north america in 2014 production in europe and south america continues to be impacted by the economic uncertainties in those regions european production increased only 2  in 2014 and declined by 17  in south america in light of the continued economic uncertainties in these regions we have initiated restructuring actions as appropriate in order to align our manufacturing capacity and footprint with the current automotive production levels as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global economy we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure however we believe our strong balance sheet coupled with our flexible cost structure will position us to capitalize on any strengthening of the global economy and improvements in oem production volumes 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2014  were 170 billion  or 3  higher compared to 2013 this compares to total global oem production increases of 2  in 2014 the increase in our total net sales is primarily attributable to increased sales in north america and asia pacific although our net sales in europe also increased modestly in 2014 our sales continue to be impacted by persisting economic uncertainties in the region which have resulted in limited growth in oem production partially offsetting these increases were reduced sales in our smallest region south america due to continuing economic weakness resulting in continued reductions in oem production schedules in the region our overall lean cost structure along with improving sales in north america and abovemarket sales growth in the asia pacific region specifically china enabled us to improve gross margins in the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the prior year 

the increase in our total net sales of 6 during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 2012 was attributable to the fourth quarter 2012 acquisition and successful integration of mvl as well as due to increased sales in north america and asia pacific offset by oem production volume reductions in europe 

delphi typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive component supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which have placed and will continue to place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

2014  versus 2013 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were as follows 



total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2014  versus december 31 2013  



total net sales for the year  ended december 31 2014  increased 3  compared to the year  ended december 31 2013  we experienced volume growth of 5 for the period primarily as a result of increased sales in north america and asia pacific partially offset by contractual price reductions 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales 

cost of sales increased   283 million  for the year  ended december 31 2014  compared to the year  ended december 31 2013  as summarized below the companys material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the year  ended   december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  



 the increase  in cost of sales reflects increased volumes before contractual price reductions for the period partially offset by operational performance improvements and the following unfavorable items in other above 

 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and increased  as a percent of sales during the year  ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  due to an increase in accruals for incentive compensation information technology costs and for other service providers 

amortization   



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets primarily recognized as part of the acquisition and resulting from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 the relative consistency in amortization expense during the year  ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  reflects the continued amortization of these definitelived intangible assets in 2015 we expect to incur noncash amortization charges of approximately 104 million  which includes the charges related to definitelived intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions completed in 2014 

restructuring   



restructuring charges recorded during 2014 were primarily attributable to the expenses incurred in conjunction with our ongoing restructuring programs focused on aligning our manufacturing capacity and footprint with the current automotive production levels in europe and south america these charges included the recognition of employeerelated and other costs of 35 million  during the year  ended december 31 2014  for the initiation of a new restructuring program at a european manufacturing site within the powertrain systems segment in the second quarter of 2014 we expect to make cash payments of approximately 80 million  in 2015 pursuant to these programs restructuring expenses recorded during the year  ended december 31 2013  were primarily attributable to the initiation of various restructuring actions primarily in europe in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in the first quarter of 2013 these restructuring actions were initiated in response to lower oem production volumes in europe and continued economic uncertainties and included workforce reductions as well as plant closures and have been substantially completed during 2014 

we expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2015 related primarily to our ongoing restructuring actions in europe and south america as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure

interest expense 



the decrease  in interest expense for the year  ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2013  reflects a reduction in interest expense from the repayment of a portion of the tranche a term loan and the redemption of the 5875 senior notes offset by the issuance of 700 million of the 415  2014 senior notes in the first quarter of 2014 

refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other income net 



the decrease in other income net is a result of delphi repaying a portion of the tranche a term loan and redeeming the 5875 senior notes during the year  ended december 31 2014  resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 34 million additionally during the year ended december 31 2014  delphi incurred approximately 6 million  in transaction costs related to its 2014 acquisitions partially offsetting these expenses during the year  ended december 31 2014  delphi recorded 10 million  of interest income and also reached a final settlement with its insurance carrier related to a business interruption insurance claim and received proceeds from the settlement of approximately 14 million net of related costs and expenses 

during the year ended december 31 2013  delphi amended its credit agreement and repaid the entire balance of the tranche b term loan from the original credit agreement resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 39 million 

refer to note 19 other income net and note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

income taxes 



the company’s tax rate is affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance 

the effective tax rate was 17  and 17  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2014  was impacted by favorable geographic income mix in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in the underlying operations of the business as well as tax planning initiatives and the resulting favorable impact on foreign tax credits these favorable impacts were offset by net increases resulting from changes in judgment related to deferred tax asset valuation allowances of 18 million in 2014 

the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2013  was impacted by the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 on january 2 2013 which retroactively reinstated expired tax provisions known as tax extenders including the research and development tax credit the income tax accounting effect including any retroactive effect of a tax law change is accounted for in the period of enactment which in this case was the first quarter of 2013 as a result the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 was impacted by a tax benefit of approximately 22 million  related to the 2012 research and development credit in addition to the 2013 research and development credit on july 17 2013 the united kingdom finance bill of 2013 became law as the finance act 2013 the “uk finance act” the uk finance act provides for a reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 23  to 21  effective april 1 2014 with a further reduction to 20  effective april 1 2015 the impact of this legislation was recorded as a discrete item during the third quarter of 2013 the period of enactment and resulted in increased tax expense of approximately 12 million  for the year ended december 31 2013 due to the resultant impact on the net deferred tax asset balances additionally the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2013 was impacted by a reduction in tax reserves of 13 million partially offset by an increase in withholding taxes due to overall increased earnings and full year inclusion of mvl activity in 2013 

equity income 



equity income net of tax reflects delphi’s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equitymethod investments equity income decreased  during the year  ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2013  which is primarily attributable to declines in performance at our korean joint ventures as compared to the prior period 

results of operations by segment 

we operate our core business along the following operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

 39 

 through december 31 2013 we evaluated performance based on standalone segment adjusted ebitda and accounted for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at current market prices our management believed that adjusted ebitda was a meaningful measure of performance and it was used by management to analyze company and standalone segment operating performance management also used adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting purposes effective january 1 2014 our management began utilizing segment adjusted operating income as the key performance measure of segment income of loss and for planning and forecasting purposes as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments segment adjusted operating income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to delphi which is the most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted operating income that is in accordance with us gaap segment adjusted operating income as determined and measured by delphi should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income includes restructuring other project and integration costs related to acquisitions and other portfolio transactions and asset impairments the reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net income attributable to delphi for the year s ended december 31 2014  and 2013  are as follows 





net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales and adjusted operating income by segment for the year s ended december 31 2014  and 2013  are as follows 

net sales by segment 



gross margin percentage by segment 



adjusted operating income by segment 



as noted in the table above adjusted operating income for the year  ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2013  was impacted by volume and contractual price reductions including product mix and operational performance improvements as well as the following items included in other in the table above

cost of sales increased 706 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the year ended december 31 2012  as summarized below the companys material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the year ended december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  



 the increase in cost of sales reflects increased volumes before contractual price reductions for the period partially offset by operational performance improvements and the following items in other above 

 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and decreased as a percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2013 

compared to 2012 due to a reduction in accruals for incentive compensation offset by costs from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 

amortization 



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets primarily recognized as part of the acquisition and resulting from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 the increase in amortization during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 resulted primarily from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 

restructuring 



the decrease in restructuring expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 is due to the initiation of various restructuring actions primarily in europe in the fourth quarter of 2012 which are expected to total approximately 300 million additional restructuring programs totaling approximately 75 million were initiated in the first quarter of 2013 these restructuring actions were initiated in response to lower oem production volumes in europe and continued economic uncertainties and include workforce reductions as well as plant closures 

refer to note 10 restructuring to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

interest expense 



the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 reflects the issuance of 800 million of 10year 50 unsecured senior notes in the first quarter of 2013 partially offset by a reduction in interest expense from the repayment of the senior secured tranche b term loan with the proceeds 

refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other income net 



the decrease in other income net is a result of delphi amending its credit agreement and repaying the entire balance of the tranche b term loan from the original credit agreement resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 39 million partially offset by the absence of transaction costs of 13 million incurred in 2012 related to the acquisition of mvl

income taxes 



the company’s tax rate is affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance the companys geographic income mix was favorably impacted in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to tax planning initiatives 

the effective tax rate was 17 and 16 for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted on january 2 2013 which retroactively reinstated expired tax provisions known as tax extenders including the research and development tax credit the income tax accounting effect including any retroactive effect of a tax law change is accounted for in the period of enactment which in this case was the first quarter of 2013 as a result the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 was impacted by a tax benefit of approximately 22 million related to the 2012 research and development credit in addition to the 2013 research and development credit on july 17 2013 the united kingdom finance bill of 2013 became law as the finance act 2013 the “uk finance act” the uk finance act provides for a reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 23 to 21 effective april 1 2014 with a further reduction to 20 effective april 1 2015 the impact of this legislation was recorded as a discrete item during the third quarter of 2013 the period of enactment and resulted in increased tax expense of approximately 12 million for the year ended december 31 2013 due to the resultant impact on the net deferred tax asset balances additionally the effective tax rate in the year ended december 31 2013 was impacted by a reduction in tax reserves of 13 million partially offset by an increase in withholding taxes due to overall increased earnings and full year inclusion of mvl activity in 2013

results of operations by segment 

through december 31 2013 we evaluated performance based on standalone segment adjusted ebitda and accounted for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at current market prices our management believed that adjusted ebitda was a meaningful measure of performance and it was used by management to analyze company and standalone segment operating performance management also used adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting purposes effective january 1 2014 our management began utilizing segment adjusted operating income as the key performance measure of segment income of loss and for planning and forecasting purposes as management believes this 

measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments segment adjusted operating income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to delphi which is the most directly comparable financial measure to adjusted operating income that is in accordance with us gaap segment adjusted operating income as determined and measured by delphi should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income includes restructuring other project and integration costs related to acquisitions and other portfolio transactions and asset impairments the reconciliation of adjusted operating income to net income attributable to delphi for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  are as follows

 liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements operational restructuring activities and dividends on share capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 09 billion  and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 15 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 15 billion revolving credit facility and the €350 million committed european accounts receivable factoring facility described below we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below dividends on ordinary shares and capital expenditures we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement while a substantial portion of our operating income is generated by our nonus subsidiaries we utilize a combination of strategies including dividends cash pooling arrangements intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs if additional nonus cash was needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate such funds however based on our current liquidity needs and repatriation strategies we do not anticipate a need to repatriate such additional amounts additionally the company is a uk resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings as a result we do not anticipate foreign earnings would be subject to a 35  tax rate upon repatriation to the uk as is the case when us based companies repatriate earnings to the us for further information regarding undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries see note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 

based on these factors we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2015 and beyond

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in fasb asc 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill in addition an acquisition may include a contingent consideration component such as in our acquisition of antaya the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price this estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 

we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations  product recall costs 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers we are also at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when a customer or the company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product in addition the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has the authority under certain circumstances to require recalls to remedy safety concerns product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall including labor to remove and replace the recalled part the company accrues for costs related 

to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods it is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

environmental matters 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage the cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering financial and legal specialists based on current law and considers the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that where applicable other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments the process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site the complexity of the site the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and if applicable other responsible parties in future periods new laws or regulations advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

delphi does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2014 2013 or 2012 the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2014 expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 625  and 750  for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates to determine the expected return on plan assets the marketrelated value of approximately 50  of our plan assets is actual fair value the expected return on the remainder of our plan assets is determined by applying the expected longterm rate of return on assets to a calculated marketrelated value of these plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of the plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 

our pension expense for 2015 is determined at the december 31 2014 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we monitor our longlived and definite lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review if impairment indicators exist we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the longlived assets to the related net book values if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is measured and recognized an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the longlived assets even if an impairment charge is not required a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required however if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we review indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired the company does not perform a qualitative assessment step 0 for indefinite lived intangible assets but performs a quantitative review based upon forecasted cash flows similar to goodwill above other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2014  the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected 

profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we were in a net derivative liability position of 104 million  and 2 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because delphi’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the delphi automotive plc long term incentive plan “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to delphis executives were made under the plc ltip in 2012 2013 and 2014 and are expected to be made annually the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the companys ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions that impact the performancebased vesting portion of the rsus we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the companys best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets on a straightline basis over the requisite vesting period of the awards adjusted for an estimate for forfeitures the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as differences in actual results from managements estimates could result in estimated or 

actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the companys future results of operations and financial condition 

we expensed the estimated fair value of the value creation plan the “vcp” a longterm incentive plan for key employees as defined and further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein estimating the fair value for the vcp required us to make assumptions regarding the nature of the payout of the award as well as changes in our share price during the postinitial public offering period the awards vested on december 31 2012 the end of the performance period 

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2014  are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices currently we do not have any options or instruments with nonlinear returns 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows in some instances we choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the euro mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty turkish lira and brazilian real as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  the net fair value asset of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 688 million and 859 million respectively the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 175 million and 205 million at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximately 27 million and approximately 8 million at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 35 million and 33 million at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 400 million  of floating rate debt principally related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 100 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 025 to 050 up to a maximum of 10 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2014

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from low cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2012 and 2013 the industry saw increased global customer sales and production schedules however while oem vehicle production in north america is now above prerecession levels production in europe continues to be impacted by the economic uncertainties in the region and decreased further by 1  in 2013 following a 6 decline in 2012 demand for automotive parts in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit 

availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our automotive commercial vehicle and aftermarket customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as recommendations by the us national highway traffic safety administration for rear view cameras in all vehicles as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as those that reduce driver distractions and proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance technologies include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control driver awareness and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change higher oil prices increased concern about oil dependence and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2016 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in co 2  emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve thermal management engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive so that time in a vehicle is more productive and enjoyable the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving also with increased smart phone usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents delphis myfi suite of infotainment products seamlessly integrate smart phones with vehicles allowing greater connectivity to the devices and cloud based content and services delphis myfi then couples active safety products to monitor the environment inside and outside the vehicle to help enable connectivity in a safer environment coupled with alerts audio commands and responses driver awareness can be enhanced and increased connectivity enabled 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation

 7 

thermal systems  this segment offers energy efficient thermal system and component solutions for the automotive market and continues to develop applications for the nonautomotive market our automotive thermal products are designed to meet customers’ needs for powertrain thermal management and cabin thermal comfort climate control   

 competition 

although the overall number of our top competitors decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation the automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive oems rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality price reliability and timeliness of delivery product design capability technical expertise and development capability new product innovation financial viability application of lean principles operational flexibility customer service and overall management in addition our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies through cost reductions andor price improvement on a yearoveryear basis 

our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows 

customers 

we sell our products and services to the major global oems in every region of the world we also sell our products to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts including the aftermarket operations of our oem customers and to other distributors and retailers the following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended december 31 2013 

supply relationships with our customers 

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the timeframe involved 

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas for our continuing operations is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 net property data is as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 



 research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2013 we employed over 19000  scientists engineers and technicians around the world total expenditures for research and development activities which include engineering were approximately 13 billion  12 billion  and 12 billion  for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 25 of engineering expenses 

we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for engineering activities to be approximately 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks particularly those protecting the delphi brand are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include aluminum copper and resins as of december 31 2013 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper aluminum petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a 

combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our electricalelectronic architecture segment and aluminum which primarily affects our thermal segment contract escalation clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper and aluminum our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically reduce production during the month of july and halt operations for approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 117000 people 5000 in the us and 112000 outside of the us 26000 salaried employees and 91000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 44000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the iuecwa the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union and its local union 87l together the “usw” and confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa and the usw with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 21 million  21 million  and 22 million respectively of which 7 million 8 million and 7 million respectively related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows automakers across europe are continuing to experience difficulties as economic uncertainties persist in the region oem vehicle production in europe decreased by 1 from 2012 to 2013 following a decrease of 6 from 2011 to 2012 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from these oem customers a prolonged downturn in the european automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations continued uncertainty relating to the economic conditions in europe may continue to have an adverse impact on our business if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 44 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2013  accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

we may not realize sales represented by awarded business 

we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes our customers generally do not guarantee volumes in addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed if actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

we have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base we have identified the asia pacific region and more specifically china as a key market likely to experience substantial growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in those regions if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in this region we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the 

invested capital to take advantage of other markets potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper aluminum and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in low cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry 

the global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china and by the anticipated global economic recovery we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and 

results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs and political social and economic instability 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including in the case of automotive sales increased gasoline prices or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles using alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 447 million as of december 31 2013  the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 906 million  at december 31 2013  of which 14 million  is included in accrued liabilities and 892 million  is included in longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units value is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the 

reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot assure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 68  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2013  was invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico and countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2013  approximately 68  of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including   

 19 

 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we expect to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers and redundant infrastructure a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims and product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to   

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows an example of such changing regulation is the adoption by the sec of annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in their products these provisions will require continued due diligence efforts with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may 2014 there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals that we may find to be used in our products 

we are also subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities in the us and abroad the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third 

parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 21 million  at december 31 2013  for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of polychlorinated biphenyls or storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2013  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2013  claims totaling approximately 200 million  using december 31 2013  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2013  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 31 million  using december 31 2013  foreign currency rates 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

there is a significant risk that the irs will assert that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes if we were unsuccessful in defending against this assertion this could result in a material impact on our future tax liability 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc delphi automotive plc is a united kingdom “uk” resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings 

delphi automotive llp which acquired certain businesses of the predecessor on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” was established on august 19 2009 as a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of england and wales at the time of its formation delphi automotive llp elected to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we believe there is a significant risk that the internal revenue service the “irs” may assert that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes retroactive to the acquisition date if delphi automotive llp were treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we expect that although delphi automotive plc incorporated under the laws of jersey and is a tax resident in the uk it would also be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

delphi automotive llp filed us federal partnership tax returns for 2009 2010 and 2011 the irs is currently reviewing whether section 7874 applies to delphi automotive llp’s acquisition of certain businesses of the predecessor we believe after consultation with counsel that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc should be treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes and intend to vigorously contest any assertion by the irs to the contrary including through litigation if we were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs however no assurance can be given that the irs will not contend or that a court will not conclude that delphi automotive llp and therefore delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2013  

if these entities were treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes the company would be subject to us federal income tax on its worldwide taxable income including distributions as well as deemed income inclusions from some of its nonus subsidiaries this could have a material adverse impact on our income tax liability in the future however the company may also benefit from deducting certain expenses that are currently not deducted in the us as a us company any dividends we pay to nonus shareholders could also be subject to us federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 unless reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty and it is possible that tax may be withheld on such dividends in certain circumstances even before a final determination has been made with respect to the companys us income tax status in addition we could be liable for the failure by delphi automotive llp to withhold us federal income taxes on distributions to its nonus members for periods beginning on or after the acquisition date 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws in particular we will seek to run ourselves in such a way that we are and remain tax resident in the united kingdom while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

brazil matters 

delphi conducts significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while delphi believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circums tances as of december 31 2013  the majority of claims asserted against delphi in brazil relate to such litigation the remaining claims in brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2013  claims totaling approximately 200 million  using december 31 2013  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi in brazil as of december 31 2013  the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of 31 million  using december 31 2013  foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materiall y from the company’s recorded estimates and delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected

leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key megatrends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in each of our product lines 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets particularly in china in addition our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure we actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value we will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic alliances  we intend to continue to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

rate of economic recovery  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production increased 3  from 2012 to 2013  and is expected to increase by an additional 5 in 2014 economic uncertainties persist in europe resulting in reduced consumer demand for vehicles and a decrease in vehicle production in europe of 1  from 2012 to 2013  continued economic weakness in europe or weakness in north america or asia could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally volatility in oil and gasoline prices negatively impacts consumer confidence and automotive sales as well as the mix of future sales from trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller fuelefficient passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base along with our flexible cost structure have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts to vehicles with less content would adversely impact our profitability 

emerging markets growth  rising income levels in the emerging markets principally china are resulting in stronger growth rates in these markets our strong global presence and presence in these markets have positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates we continue to expand our established presence in emerging markets positioning us to benefit from the expected growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the emerging market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets we believe that our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the emerging markets 

we have a strong presence in china where we have operated for nearly 20 years all of our business segments have operations and sales in china as a result we have wellestablished relationships with all of the major oems in china we generated approximately 27 billion  in revenue from china in 2013  with only 22 of our 33 offered products locally manufactured in 2013  we believe we have the opportunity to expand additional product lines into china and as a result we see further growth potential 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ need to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content related to safety fuel efficiency emissions control automated features and connectivity to the global information network our electricalelectronic architecture and electronics and safety segments are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content and electrification requiring a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as hybrid power electronics electrical vehicle monitoring lane departure warning systems integrated electronic displays navigation systems and consumer electronics our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ need to reduce emissions while continuing to meet the demands of consumers additionally our powertrain systems and thermal systems segments are also focused on addressing the demand for increased fuel efficiency and emission control by improving fuel consumption and heat dissipation which are principal factors influencing fuel efficiency and emissions 

global capabilities  many oems are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model principally services the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of more than 19000  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15  major technical centers in brazil china france germany india luxembourg mexico poland south korea the united kingdom and the united states we invest approximately 17 billion which includes approximately 400 million coinvestment by customers and government agencies annually in research and development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and ownedheld approximately 8000 patents and protective rights as of december 31 2013  we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 400 million annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is 

fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable despite decreases in industry volumes and at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle we believe that our lean cost structure will allow us to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 94 of our hourly workforce is located in low cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 32 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2013  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and manufacturing footprint in response to continued economic uncertainties as evidenced by the restructuring activities including the actions related to the integration of mvl we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 particularly in europe totaling approximately 375 million as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global economy we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2013  results we estimate that our ebitda breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 43 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 24 billion  and substantial liquidity of approximately 29 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2013  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

mexico tax reform  delphi conducts its mexican operations primarily through the maquiladora regime which has historically provided certain tax benefits mexican tax reform legislation was enacted on december 11 2013 and became effective on january 1 2014 resulting in an increase of the statutory tax rate and changes to the vat rules that apply to these operations the legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions but an executive order issued on december 26 2013 substantially eliminated the impact of these limitations on the maquiladora regime the company does not expect the changes resulting from this legislation to have a material impact on our results from operations or financial condition 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of the former delphi corporation our predecessor “the acquisition” which along with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of the predecessor and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of certain lenders to the predecessor general motors company gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” 

on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion the redemption transaction was funded by a 30 billion credit facility entered into on march 31 2011 and existing cash 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares by its equity holders in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

consolidated results of operations 

in 2013  total global oem production volumes increased 3  from 2012 although total global oem production volumes increased indicating a stabilization of the global economy the economic recovery was uneven from a regional perspective while oem vehicle production in china increased 13 in 2013 and in north america is now above prerecession levels production in europe continues to be impacted by the economic uncertainties in the region and following a 6 decline from 2011 to 2012 declined further by 1  in 2013 in light of the continued economic uncertainties particularly in europe and as part of our continued efforts to optimize our industry leading cost structure and increase shareholder value we initiated and committed to approximately 75 million  of further restructuring actions primarily in europe during the first quarter of 2013 these restructuring initiatives are in addition to approximately 300 million  of restructuring programs initiated during the fourth quarter of 2012 bringing the overall commitments of our restructuring programs to approximately 375 million these restructuring actions are principally focused on the european region and are expected to be substantially completed in the first half of 2014 approximately 170 million of the total was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012 with an additional 145 million  recognized in the year ended december 31 2013  as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global economy we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure however we believe our strong balance sheet coupled with our flexible cost structure will position us to capitalize on any strengthening of the global economy and improvements in oem production volumes 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2013  were 165 billion  or 6  higher compared to 2012 this compares to total global oem production increases of 3  in 2013 the increase in our total net sales is attributable to the fourth quarter 2012 acquisition and successful integration of mvl as well as due to increased sales in north america and asia pacific offset by continued oem production volume reductions in europe the operating results of mvl are reported within the electricalelectronic architecture segment from the date of acquisition given the timing of the acquisition it is not fully reflected in our 2012 results and impacts comparability to 2013 results 

the slight decline in our total net sales of 3 during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 2011 reflects the impacts of negative currency translation from euro and brazilian real denominated sales to us dollars which resulted in lower reported sales despite the fact that delphis overall sales volumes in 2012 were consistent with those in 2011 although total global oem production increased 6 in 2012 as compared to 2011 a significant portion of this production increase was attributable to japanese oems recovering from the march 2011 japan earthquake and tsunami as delphi has a relatively limited content penetration with the japanese oems as anticipated our volume growth from our oem customers in 2012 was slower than the overall market 

delphi typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive component supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which have placed and will continue to place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

2013 versus 2012 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012 were as follows 

total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2013  versus december 31 2012  

total net sales for the year  ended december 31 2013  increased 6  compared to the year  ended december 31 2012  we experienced volume growth of 3 for the period as a result of increased sales in north america and asia pacific partially offset by continued oem production volume reductions in europe overall net sales also increased as a result of the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 net of other divestitures of approximately 695 million reflected in other above 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percent of net sales 

cost of sales increased   706 million  for the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to the year  ended december 31 2012  as summarized below the companys material cost of sales was approximately 50 of net sales in both the year  ended   

december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  

 

 the increase  in cost of sales reflects increased volumes before contractual price reductions for the period partially offset by operational performance improvements and the following items in other above 

 closed as a result of delphis overall restructuring program 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and decreased  as a percent of sales during the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to 2012  due to a reduction in accruals for incentive compensation offset by costs from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 

amortization   



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets primarily recognized as part of the acquisition and resulting from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 the increase in amortization during the year  ended december 31 2013  compared to 2012  resulted primarily from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 

restructuring   



the decrease in restructuring expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 is due to the initiation of various restructuring actions primarily in europe in the fourth quarter of 2012 which are expected to total approximately 300 million additional restructuring programs totaling approximately 75 million were initiated in the first quarter of 2013 these restructuring actions were initiated in response to lower oem production volumes in europe and continued economic uncertainties and include workforce reductions as well as plant closures and are expected to be substantially completed during the first half of 2014 

refer to note 10 restructuring to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

interest expense 



the increase  in interest expense for the year  ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2012  reflects the issuance of 800 million of 10year 50 unsecured senior notes in the first quarter of 2013 partially offset by a reduction in interest expense from the repayment of the senior secured tranche b term loan with the proceeds 

refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other income net 



the decrease in other income net is a result of delphi amending its credit agreement and repaying the entire balance of the tranche b term loan from the original credit agreement resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 39 million  partially offset by the absence of transaction costs of 13 million incurred in 2012 related to the acquisition of mvl

 liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements and operational restructuring activities our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions dividends on share capital additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in 

addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 21 million  of which 3 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 18 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 21 million  of which 3 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 18 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities delphi cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

    acquisitions 

in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in fasb asc 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill 

          we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

           our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

           other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with us gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

environmental matters 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage the cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering financial and legal specialists based on current law and considers the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that where applicable other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments the process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site the complexity of the site the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and if applicable other responsible parties in future periods new laws or regulations advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimated and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the projected benefit obligation “pbo” for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

delphi does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2013 2012 or 2011 the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2013 expense we assumed a longterm expected asset rate of return of approximately 625  and 850  for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates 

our pension expense for 2014 is determined at the december 31 2013 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we periodically review the recoverability of our longlived and definite lived assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a 

reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required however if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we review indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired the company does not perform a qualitative assessment step 0 for indefinite lived intangible assets but performs a quantitative review based upon forecasted cash flows similar to goodwill above other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2013  the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in 

the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we were in a net derivative liability position of 2 million  and net derivative asset position of 14 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because delphi’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the delphi automotive plc long term incentive plan “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to delphis executives were made under the plc ltip in 2012 and 2013 and are expected to be made annually the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the companys ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award including an estimate for forfeitures and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the companys best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets on a straightline basis over the requisite vesting period of the awards the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as differences in actual results from managements estimates could result in estimated or actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the companys future results of operations and financial condition 

we expensed the estimated fair value of the value creation plan the “vcp” a longterm incentive plan for key employees as defined and further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein estimating the fair value for the vcp required us to make assumptions regarding the nature of the payout of the award as well as changes in our share price during the postinitial public offering period the awards vested on december 31 2012 the end of the performance period 

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2013  are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices currently we do not have any options or instruments with nonlinear returns 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows in some instances we choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi polish zloty turkish lira and brazilian real as of december 31 2013  the net fair value asset of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approxim ately 859 million a nd the net fair value asset at december 31 2012  was 839 million the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approxim ately 205 million and 168 mi llion at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximate ly 8 million a nd approximately 5 million at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase b y 33 million  and 26 million at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 564 million  of floating rate debt principally related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option of either a the abr plus 025 per annum or b libor plus 125 per annum 

the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 025 to 050 up to a maximum of 10 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate 

during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2013

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by increasing government regulations for vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control as well as rapidly increasing consumer demand for connectivity these industry megatrends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into four diversified segments which enable us to develop solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these megatrends

 financial information about business segments 

we operate our core business along four operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

net sales by segment 



refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 21 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for further financial information about business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes all 25  of the largest automotive oems in the world and in 2012 25  of our net sales came from emerging markets asia pacific and south america our six largest platforms in 2012 were with five different oems in addition in 2012 our products were found in 17 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states in all of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 17 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have further diversified our business by increasing our sales in the commercial vehicle market which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market and has grown to 11 of our 2012 net sales in addition approximately 7 of our 2012 net sales were to the aftermarket which meets the ongoing need for replacement parts required for vehicle servicing 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from low cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2011 and 2012 the industry saw increased customer sales and production schedules however oem vehicle production in europe decreased by 6  from 2011 to 2012 and current oem production volumes in western europe and to a lesser extent north america remain substantially lower than oem production volumes prior to the disruptions that the economic and credit markets experienced in 2008 and 2009 demand for automotive parts in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced which is 

primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

we believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “megatrends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our automotive commercial vehicle and aftermarket customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as proposals by the us national highway traffic safety administration to issue rules in 2013 that would phasein requirements for rear view cameras in all vehicles as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as those that reduce driver distractions and proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance technologies include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control driver awareness and automatic braking 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change higher oil prices increased concern about oil dependence and recent and pending regulation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2016 in many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems including those in the us and china will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in co 2  emissions over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve thermal management engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains eg electrichybrid propulsion as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive so that time in a vehicle is more productive and enjoyable the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving also with increased smart phone usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents delphis myfi suite of infotainment products seamlessly integrate smart phones with vehicles allowing greater connectivity to the devices and cloud based content and services delphis myfi then couples active safety products to monitor the environment inside and outside the vehicle to help enable connectivity in a safer environment coupled with alerts audio commands and responses driver awareness can be enhanced and increased connectivity enabled 

we expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet oem demands for rapid innovation

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and have the ability to issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the timeframe involved 

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas for our continuing operations is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 net property data is as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 



 research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2012 we employed over 18000  scientists engineers and technicians around the world total expenditures for research and development activities which include engineering were approximately 12 billion  12 billion  and 10 billion  for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 25 of engineering expenses 

we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for engineering activities to be approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks particularly those protecting the delphi brand are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include aluminum copper and resins as of december 31 2012 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper aluminum petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and 

material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our electricalelectronic architecture segment and aluminum which primarily affects our thermal segment contract escalation clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper and aluminum our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically halt operations for approximately two weeks in july and approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 118000 people 5000 in the us and 113000 outside of the us 25000 salaried employees and 93000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 37000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the iuecwa the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union and its local union 87l together the “usw” and confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa and the usw with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 21 million  22 million  and 23 million respectively of which 8 million 7 million and 8 million respectively related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows automakers across europe are experiencing difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit markets oem vehicle production in europe decreased by 6 from 2011 to 2012 as a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from these oem customers a prolonged downturn in the european automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations continued uncertainty relating to the economic conditions in europe may continue to have an adverse impact on our business if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oems vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2012 accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

we have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base we have identified the asia pacific and south american regions and china brazil and india in particular as key markets likely to experience substantial growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in those regions if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will 

act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper aluminum and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in low cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry 

the global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china brazil india and russia additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to 

selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china brazil india and russia and by the anticipated global economic recovery we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we may encounter manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs and political social and economic instability 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including in the case of automotive sales increased gasoline prices or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles using alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary funded nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 426 million as of december 31 2012 the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 863 million  at december 31 2012 of which 23 million  is included in accrued liabilities and 840 million  is included in longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets 

we have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 

additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling for goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units value is less than its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we cannot assure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 67  of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the euro currency and the economic outlook for many european countries including those that do not use the euro as their currency persist given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico and countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 67  of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including   

 19 

 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy in addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed 

we expect to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence however the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers and redundant infrastructure a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims and product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to   

 20 

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters 

we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof the introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows an example of such changing regulation is the recent adoption by the sec of annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in their products these new requirements will require due diligence efforts in fiscal 2013 with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may 2014 there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals that we may find to be used in our products 

we are also subject to regulation governing among other things 

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities in the us and abroad the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 21 million  at december 31 2012 for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of polychlorinated biphenyls or storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2012 related claims totaling approximately 215 million  using december 31 2012 foreign currency rates had been asserted against us as of december 31 2012 we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 38 million  using december 31 2012 foreign currency rates 

we are subject to a pending antitrust investigation in the european union related to the supply of wire harnesses to vehicle manufacturers for which no accruals have been recorded as of december 31 2012 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

there is a significant risk that the irs will assert that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes if we were unsuccessful in defending against this assertion this could result in a material impact on our future tax liability 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc delphi automotive plc is a united kingdom “uk” resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings 

delphi automotive llp which acquired certain businesses of the predecessor on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” was established on august 19 2009 as a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of england and wales at the time of its formation delphi automotive llp elected to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

we believe there is a significant risk that the internal revenue service the irs may assert that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes retroactive to the acquisition date if delphi automotive llp were treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we expect that although delphi automotive plc incorporated under the laws of jersey and is a tax resident in the uk it would also be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

delphi automotive llp filed us federal partnership tax returns for 2009 2010 and 2011 the irs is currently reviewing whether section 7874 applies to delphi automotive llp’s acquisition of certain businesses of the predecessor we believe after consultation with counsel that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc should be treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes and intend to vigorously contest any assertion by the irs to the contrary including through litigation if we were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs however no assurance can be given that the irs will not contend or that a court will not conclude that delphi automotive llp and therefore delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2012 

if these entities were treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes the company would be subject to us federal income tax on its worldwide taxable income including distributions as well as deemed income inclusions from some of its nonus subsidiaries this could have a material adverse impact on our income tax liability in the future however the company may also benefit from deducting certain expenses that are currently not deducted in the us as a us company any dividends we pay to nonus shareholders could also be subject to us federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 unless reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty and it is possible that tax may be withheld on such dividends in certain circumstances even before a final determination has been made with respect to the companys us income tax status in addition we could be liable for the failure by delphi automotive llp to withhold us federal income taxes on distributions to its nonus members for periods beginning on or after the acquisition date 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws in particular we will seek to run ourselves in such a way that we are and remain tax resident in the united kingdom while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

european union antitrust investigation 

delphi has received requests for information from antitrust authorities at the european commission seeking information about alleged conduct by delphi in connection with an investigation of automotive parts suppliers concerning possible violations of antitrust laws related to the supply of wire harnesses to vehicle manufacturers delphi is cooperating fully with the european authorities investigations of this nature often continue for several years and may result in fines imposed by the european authorities depending on its size a potential fine could result in a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results and cash flows at this time delphi is unable to estimate any reasonably possible range of loss that may ultimately result from this investigation no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2012  

unsecured creditors litigation 

in december 2011 a complaint was filed in the bankruptcy court alleging that the redemption by delphi automotive llp of the membership interests of gm and the pbgc the initial public offering and a distribution by delphi automotive llp in the amount of 95 million  principally in respect of taxes constituted in the aggregate distributions to the members of delphi automotive llp in excess of 72 billion  the complaint further alleged that such aggregate distributions obligate delphi automotive llp to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against the predecessor 3250  for every 6750  in excess of 72 billion  in distributions up to a maximum of 300 million  in march 2012 the bankruptcy court heard arguments and granted delphi’s motion to dismiss the complaint in june 2012 the unsecured creditors filed an appeal of the decision of the bankruptcy court with the united states district court for the southern district of new york the “us district court” in october 2012 the us district court upheld the decision of the bankruptcy court because no further appeal was taken the decision is final no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2012  as the company was able to successfully defend against this claim 

warranty matter 

in 2009 we received information regarding potential warranty claims related to certain components supplied by our powertrain segment in march 2011 we reached a settlement with our customer related to this matter during the three months ended march 31 2011 we recognized an unusual warranty expense in cost of sales of approximately 76 million as a result of the settlement agreement in april 2011 delphi made a payment of €90 million approximately 133 million at april 30 2011 foreign currency rates related to this matter in april 2012 we made the final scheduled payment of €60 million approximately 80 million at april 30 2012 foreign currency rates related to this matter in september 2012 as a result of favorable warranty claims experience we reached a final settlement with our customer related to ongoing warranty claims for production subsequent to the march 2011 settlement and recorded a change in our previous estimate of warranty claims by recognizing a 25 million reduction of warranty expense in cost of sales in september 2012 

we have recognized our best estimate for our total aggregate warranty reserves across all of our operating segments as of december 31 2012 the estimated reasonably possible amount to ultimately resolve all matters is not materially different from the recorded reserves 

brazil matters 

delphi conducts significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while delphi believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances in addition delphi also is a party to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in brazil as of december 31 2012  related claims totaling 215 million  using december 31 2012  foreign currency rates have been asserted against delphi as of december 31 2012  the company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of 38 million  using december 31 2012  foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while the company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the company’s recorded estimates and delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected 

iran sanctions disclosure 

the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 “itrshra” which was signed into law on august 10 2012 includes a provision requiring issuers to disclose information relating to certain transactions with iran or with persons or entities designated under certain executive orders prior to the enactment of itrshra we had a longstanding policy of reviewing and determining that any matter relating to possible transactions involving iran did not violate applicable us export controls and sanctions laws and we do not believe that we have conducted any transactions that violated applicable laws during 2012 certain of our nonus affiliates engaged in transactions involving iran in accordance with applicable law our nonus affiliates have ceased transactions involving iran as of october 9 2012 as required by itrshra 

prior to october 9 2012 some of our nonus affiliates sold items out of general inventory to nonus distributors outside of iran who sold those items to retail or automotive assembly service or repair establishments in iran the sales made to these nonus distributors of items that were subsequently resold into iran totaled approximately 37 million and generated operating income of approximately 07 million in 2012 our nonus affiliates received payments of approximately 27 million related to these sales the items were all nonus origin automotive components which if exported from the united states would not have required a us export license except for direct export to iran and certain other very limited destinations or entities 

our nonus affiliates received payments from the distributors through banks outside of iran however some of those transactions may have involved transfers of funds to the distributors through iranian governmentowned banks and we are not certain of the exact path of such transfers and whether those transactions are therefore required to be disclosed under section 13r1diii or otherwise of the securities exchange act of 1934 the transactions disclosed herein were not prohibited under any us export controls and sanctions laws at the time the transactions were undertaken because they were not conducted by us persons or entities did not involve ten percent 10 or more usorigin content and were not otherwise prohibited

rate of economic recovery  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including economic conditions although global automotive vehicle production increased almost 6  from 2011 to 2012 and is expected to increase by an additional 2 in 2013 economic uncertainties persist in europe resulting in reduced consumer demand for vehicles and a decrease in vehicle production in europe of 6  from 2011 to 2012 continued economic weakness in europe or weakness in north america or asia could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally volatility in oil and gasoline prices negatively impacts consumer confidence and automotive sales as well as the mix of future sales from trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller fuelefficient passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts to vehicles with less content would adversely impact our profitability 

emerging markets growth  rising income levels in the emerging markets of china brazil india and russia are resulting in stronger growth rates in these markets our strong global presence and presence in these markets have positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates we continue to expand our established presence in emerging markets positioning us to benefit from the expected growth opportunities in these regions we are capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the emerging market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fastgrowing automotive markets including china brazil india and russia we believe that our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the emerging markets 

we have a strong presence in china where we have operated for nearly 20 years all of our business segments have operations and sales in china as a result we have wellestablished relationships with all of the major oems in china we generated approximately 23 billion  in revenue from china in 2012 with only 22 of our 33 offered products locally manufactured in 2012 we believe we have the opportunity to expand additional product lines into china and as a result we see further growth potential 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ need to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the megatrends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content related to safety fuel efficiency emissions control and connectivity to the global information network our electricalelectronic architecture and electronics and safety segments are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content and electrification requiring a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as hybrid power electronics electrical vehicle monitoring lane departure warning systems integrated electronic displays navigation systems and consumer electronics our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ need to reduce emissions while continuing to meet the demands of consumers additionally our powertrain systems and thermal systems segments are also focused on addressing the demand for increased fuel efficiency and emission control by improving fuel consumption and heat dissipation which are principal factors influencing fuel efficiency and emissions 

global capabilities  many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model has largely migrated to service the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of more than 18000  scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15  major technical centers in brazil china france germany india luxembourg mexico poland south korea the united kingdom and the united states we invest approximately 16 billion which includes approximately 400 million coinvestment by customers and government agencies annually in research and development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and ownedheld approximately 7000 patents and protective rights as of december 31 2012  we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 400 million annually in new product development accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable despite decreases in industry volumes and at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle we believe that our lean cost structure will allow us to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle as a result approximately 92 of our hourly workforce is located in low cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by 

leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers which represented approximately 28 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2012  however we will continue to adjust our cost structure and manufacturing footprint in response to continued economic uncertainties as evidenced by the restructuring activities including the actions related to the integration of mvl  we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2012 particularly in europe totaling approximately 300 million through the end of 2013 assuming constant product mix and pricing based on our 2012 results we estimate that our net income before depreciation and amortization including longlived asset and goodwill impairment interest expense other income expense net income tax expense and equity income net of tax “ebitda” breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 36 downturn to current product volumes 

we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 25 billion  and substantial liquidity of approximately 24 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2012  and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend 

on october 26 2012 we completed the acquisition of mvl mvl is a leading global manufacturer of automotive connection systems with a focus on highvalue leading technology applications we believe this transaction enhances our position as a leading supplier of automotive electricalelectronic architecture expands our portfolio of highgrowth electronic connectors further strengthens our premier customer base enhances our footprint in fastgrowing markets provides significant opportunity to accelerate longterm sales and earnings growth and delivers significant synergies which are expected to expand ebitda margins we are integrating mvl into our electricalelectronic architecture segment given the timing of the acquisition it is not fully reflected in our 2012 results and impacts comparability to 2011 and 2010 results 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of the former delphi corporation our predecessor the acquisition which along with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of the predecessor and issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of lenders to the predecessor general motors company gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” 

on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion the redemption transaction was funded by a 30 billion credit facility entered into on march 31 2011 the “credit facility” and existing cash 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares by its equity holders in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

consolidated results of operations 

in 2012 total global oem production volumes increased 6  from 2011 although total global oem production volumes increased indicating a stabilization of the global economy the economic recovery was uneven from a regional perspective continued economic uncertainties persisted in europe resulting in a reduction in consumer demand for vehicles and a decrease in vehicle production of 6  in 2012 compared to 2011 additionally although north american oem production volumes increased in 2012 current oem production volumes in western europe and to a lesser extent north america continue to be substantially less than oem production volumes prior to the disruptions in the economic and credit markets experienced in 

2008 and 2009 although our industryleading and flexible cost structure enabled us to maintain strong gross margins and operating earnings we initiated various restructuring programs in the fourth quarter that are intended to further improve our cost structure and margins and increase shareholder value we expect these restructuring activities including the actions related to the integration of mvl to total approximately 300 million through the end of 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded restructuring charges totaling 154 million  which includes employee related and other cost s additionally we recognized noncash asset impairment charges of 15 million  recognized in cost of sales approximately 75  of the restructuring actions are in europe including workforce reductions as well as plant closures and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013 the company incurred cash expenditures for these restructuring actions of approximately 20 million  in 2012 and expects future cash expenditures in 2013 of approximately 175 million  while we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in both global as well as regional economies we believe our strong balance sheet coupled with our flexible cost structure will position us to capitalize on any strengthening of global or regional economies and improvements in oem production volumes 

our total net sales during the year ended december 31 2012 were 155 billion  or 3  lower compared to 2011 although delphis overall sales volumes were consistent with the prior year reported sales were lower due to the negative currency translation from euro and brazilian real denominated sales to us dollars this compares to total global oem production increases of 6  in 2012 however a significant portion of this production increase was attributable to japanese oems recovering from the march 2011 japan earthquake and tsunami as delphi has a relatively limited content penetration with the japanese oems as anticipated our volume growth from our oem customers in 2012 was slower than the overall market 

our improved total net sales during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 reflect the impacts of increased oem production volumes as well as the level of our content per unit and to a lesser extent the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although global oem production volumes increased over 3 for the year ended december 31 2011 versus 2010 excluding production decreases from japan and japanese oem production in north america of 9 resulting from the japan earthquake and tsunami global oem production volumes increased 6 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 we did not experience any significant adverse impacts resulting from the japan earthquake and tsunami particularly given that the japanese oems are not among our principal customers 

delphi typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 the automotive component supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which have placed and will continue to place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

2012 versus 2011 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011 were as follows 

total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the years ended december 31 2012  versus december 31 2011  

total net sales for the year  ended december 31 2012  decreased 3  compared to the year  ended december 31 2011  although we experienced volume growth of approximately 1 reported sales decreased due to unfavorable currency impacts principally related to the euro and brazilian real and lower commodity passthrough additionally included in other above are increased sales of approximately 110 million resulting primarily from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 

operating results 

the information below summarizes the operating results for the year  ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2011  

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percent of net sales 

cost of sales decreased   525 million  for the year  ended december 31 2012  compared to the year  ended december 31 2011  as summarized below 



 

the decrease  in cost of sales reflects favorable currency impacts resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates operational performance and the following items in other above 

 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and increased  as a percent of sales during the year  ended december 31 2012  compared to 2011  due largely to increased accruals for incentive compensation of 17 million and the costs associated with the integration of mvl in october 2012 

amortization   



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets primarily recognized as part of the acquisition and resulting from the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 in 2013 we expect to incur incremental noncash amortization charges of approximately 20 million primarily as a result of the mvl acquisition 

restructuring   



the increase in restructuring expense is due to the initiation of various restructuring actions primarily in europe in response to lower oem production volumes in europe and continued economic uncertainties the restructuring actions include workforce reductions as well as plant closures and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013 

refer to note 10 restructuring to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

interest expense 



the increase  in interest expense for the year  ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2011  is due to the issuance of the indebtedness under the credit facility and 500 million of 5875 senior notes due 2019 and the issuance of 500 million of 6125 senior notes due 2021 collectively the “senior notes” in conjunction with the redemption of the class a and class c membership interests in march 2011 as well as the increased borrowings under the credit agreement in conjunction with the acquisition of mvl in october 2012 

refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other income net 



the increase in other income net is the result of incurring approximately 44 million in transaction costs in 2011 related to our initial public offering partially offset by transaction costs of 13 million in 2012 related to the acquisition of mvl and lower interest income 

refer to note 17 other income net to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

income taxes 



the company’s effective tax rates in both periods are affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned in each jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance the companys geographic income mix was favorably impacted in 2012  as compared to 2011  primarily due to underlying business results tax settlements and tax planning initiatives 

the effective tax rate was 16  and 20  for the year  ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the effective tax rate for the year  ended december 31 2012  was impacted by the release of 29 million  of valuation allowances a favorable tax settlement of 26 million a 30 million reduction in tax reserves due to resolution of open issues with tax authorities and a reduction of 17 million in withholding tax expense offset by an increase of 17 million primarily related to uncertain tax positions outside the us the effective tax rate in the year  ended december 31 2011  was impacted by the release of a 52 million  valuation allowance offset by an increase of 17 million  in tax reserves and 10 million  in withholding tax expense primarily related to the funding of the redemption of all the outstanding class a and class c membership interests in delphi automotive llp 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted on january 2 2013 the tax bill retroactively reinstates expired tax provisions known as tax extenders including the research and development tax credit the income tax accounting effect including any retroactive effect of a tax law change is accounted for in the period of enactment which in this case is the first quarter of 2013 as a result the company did not recognize a tax benefit of approximately 22 million  in 2012 related to the research and development credit which will favorably impact the first quarter results in 2013 

equity income 



equity income net of tax reflects delphi’s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equitymethod investments equity income increased  during the year  ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2011  primarily due to improved performance of our mexican and korean joint ventures and a 7 million impairment charge related to a european joint venture in 2011 partially offset by an 8 million  of gain on the sale of our 495  interest in daesung electric co ltd in 2011 

results of operations by segment 

we operate our core business along the following operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

 our management utilizes segment ebitda as a key performance measure segment ebitda should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to delphi which is the most directly comparable financial measure to ebitda that is in accordance with us gaap segment ebitda as determined and measured by us should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of ebitda to net income attributable to delphi for the year  ended december 31 2012  and 2011  are as follows 





net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales and ebitda by segment for the year  ended december 31 2012  and 2011  are as follows 

net sales by segment 



included in other above are increased sales of approximately 110 million related to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures 

gross margin percentage by segment 



ebitda by segment 



as noted in the table above ebitda for the year  ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2011  was impacted by volume and contractual price reductions including product mix and operational performance improvements as well as the following items included in other in the table above

total net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 16 compared to year ended december 31 2010 the increase in total net sales resulted primarily from increased volume as a result of improved oem production schedules in 2011 as well as the level of our content per unit and to a lesser extent the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the euro additionally included in other above are decreased sales of approximately 120 million related to divestitures that occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 

operating results 

the information below summarizes the operating results for the year  ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year  ended december 31 2010 

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percent of net sales cost of sales increased 1618 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 as summarized below 

  



 the increase in cost of sales was driven by increases in volume and the following items in other above 

 these increases were partially offset by improved operational performance as well as 94 million related to divested businesses primarily the occupant protection systems business on march 31 2010 

selling general and administrative expense 



selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and declined as a percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 2010 due to maintaining administrative and information technology cost increases at or lower than the increasing rate of net sales increases in sga were largely attributable to foreign exchange effects and increased accruals for incentive compensation of 29 million including the accelerated vesting of board of directors shares upon our initial public offering 

amortization   



amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets primarily recognized as part of the acquisition 

restructuring   



the decrease in restructuring expense is due to a decline in workforce reductions and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes including plant closures in the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 as we had largely completed our significant restructuring programs by the end of 2010 

refer to note 10 restructuring to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

interest expense 



the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 is due to changes in debt balances primarily related to the borrowings under the credit agreement the “credit agreement” and issuance of the 500 million of 5875 senior notes due 2019 and 500 million of 6125 senior notes due 2021 collectively the “senior notes” in conjunction with the redemption of the class a and class c membership interests 

refer to note 11 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other income net 



the increase in other expense for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to other income for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily the result of incurring approximately 44 million in transaction costs related to our initial public offering in november 2011 and an increase of 8 million loss on extinguishment of debt 

refer to note 17 other income net to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

income taxes 



the effective tax rate was 20 and 27 in 2011 and 2010 respectively the company’s tax rate is affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance in 2011 tax incentives of 64 million were obtained in various nonus countries primarily hitech enterprise status in china and the maquiladora regime in mexico and a 65 million tax benefit for income earned in jurisdictions where a valuation allowance has been recorded primarily in france 

we recognized a 52 million and 21 million tax benefit in 2011 and 2010 respectively related to changes in judgment of valuation allowances for the realization of deferred tax assets during 2011 the company recorded a withholding tax of 10 million related to the funding of the redemption of all the outstanding class a and class c membership interests and 27 million related to changes in our assertion with respect to our intent to repatriate foreign earnings in certain countries 

our annual effective tax rate may be impacted by future events including changes in tax laws geographic income mix cash requirements tax audits closure of tax years legal entity restructuring and changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets our effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from quarter to quarter resulting from interim reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events 

equity income 



equity income reflects our interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equitymethod investments equity income increased during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 partially due to the recognition of 8 million of gain on the sale of our 495 interest in daesung electric co ltd as well as improved performance at our mexican joint venture these increases were partially offset by a 7 million impairment charge related to a european joint venture 

results of operations by segment 

through december 31 2010 we evaluated performance based on standalone segment adjusted ebitda and accounted for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at current market prices our management believed that adjusted ebitda was a meaningful measure of performance and it was used by management to analyze company and standalone segment operating performance management also used adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting purposes effective january 1 2011 our management began utilizing segment ebitda as a key performance measure because our restructuring was substantially completed by the end of 2010 segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered substitutes for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to delphi which is the most directly comparable financial measure to ebitda and adjusted ebitda that is in accordance with us gaap segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda as determined and measured by us should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of ebitda to net income attributable to delphi for the year ended december 31 2011 is as follows

 liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations including capital expenditures and working capital requirements as well as to fund debt service requirements and operational restructuring activities our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations our existing cash balance and as necessary borrowings under available credit facilities to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions dividends on share capital additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes we will also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure 

as of december 31 2012  we had cash and cash equivalents of 11 billion  and net debt defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents of 14 billion  we also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the 13 billion revolving credit facility as described below we expect existing cash available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities including restructuring payments any mandatory payments required under the credit agreement as described below and capital expenditures we also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications subject to current monetary policies and to the terms of the credit agreement based on this we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and capital investments in 2013 and beyond

in january 2012 the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 300 million  of ordinary shares the program was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of december 31 2012 or when the company attained 300 million  of ordinary share repurchases which was fully satisfied in september 2012 subsequently in september 2012 the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 750 million  of ordinary shares this program will terminate when the company attains 750 million  of ordinary shares repurchases and provides for share repurchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on share price market conditions and other factors as determined by the company during the year  ended december 31 2012  delphi repurchased 13421742  shares at an average price of 3002  which totaled approximately 403 million  approximately 647 million  of share repurchases remain available under the program adopted in september 2012 all repurchased shares were retired 

during the year  ended december 31 2012  delphi received a dividend of 62 million  from one of its equity method investments the dividend was recognized as a reduction to the investment with 25 million  representing a return on investment included in cash flows from operating activities and 37 million  representing a return of capital investment and included in cash flows from investing activities 

to the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness strategic acquisitions dividends on share capital additional share repurchases andor general corporate purposes 

acquisition of motorized vehicles division of fci 

on october 26 2012 delphi completed the acquisition of mvl for €765 million  or approximately 1 billion  based on exchange rates as of the date of the acquisition mvl is a leading global manufacturer of automotive connection systems with a focus on highvalue leading technology applications 

upon completing the acquisition delphi incurred related transaction expenses totaling approximately 13 million  the cash payments required to close the transaction were funded using existing cash on hand including 363 million  drawn in october 2012 under the credit agreement 

the acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination with the purchase price being allocated on a preliminary basis using information available the operating results of mvl are reported within the electricalelectronic architecture segment from the date of acquisition and the integration of mvl is proceeding as planned 

subsequent to announcing the transaction in june 2012 the company entered into €250 million  of option contracts to hedge a portion of the currency risk associated with the cash payment for the planned acquisition of mvl at a cost of 9 million  the options were unable to qualify as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore changes in the fair value of the options were recognized in other income expense net in the year  ended december 31 2012  the change in fair value resulted in a 3 million  loss subsequently and in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition the options were sold in october 2012 for 6 million

capital expenditures 

supplier selection in the auto industry is generally finalized several years prior to the start of production of the vehicle therefore current capital expenditures are based on customer commitments entered into previously generally several years ago when the customer contract was awarded as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 233 million  in outstanding cancellable and noncancellable capital commitments capital expenditures by operating segment and geographic region for the periods presented were 



cash flows 

intramonth cash flow cycles vary by region but in general we are users of cash through the first half of a typical month and we generate cash during the latter half of a typical month due to this cycle of cash flows we may utilize shortterm financing including our revolving credit facility and european facilities to manage our intramonth working capital needs our cash balance typically peaks at month end 

cash in the us is primarily managed centrally through a us cash pooling arrangement and cash in europe is primarily managed centrally through a european cash pooling arrangement outside the us and europe cash may be managed through a country cash pool a selfmanaged cash flow arrangement or a combination of the two depending on our presence in the respective country 

operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1478 million  and 1377 million  for the year  ended december 31 2012  and 2011 respectively the 101 million  increase primarily reflects a reduction in net working capital requirements cash flow from operating activities for the year  ended december 31 2012  consisted of net earnings of 1160 million  increased by 486 million  for noncash charges for depreciation and amortization partially offset by 207 million  related to changes in operating assets and liabilities net of restructuring and pension contributions cash flow from operating activities for the year  ended december 31 2011  consisted of net earnings of 1223 million  increased by 475 million  for noncash charges for depreciation and amortization partially offset by 370 million  related to changes in operating assets and liabilities net of restructuring and pension contributions

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 1631 million  and 10 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the increase is primarily due to the maturities of time deposits of 550 million  in 2011 and 980 million  related to costs of acquisitions net of cash acquired in 2012 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 911 million for the year ended december 31 2010 which resulted primarily from the net purchase of time deposits of 550 million and capital expenditures of 500 million 

financing activities  net cash used in financing activities totaled 105 million  and 3194 million  for the year  ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively during the year  ended december 31 2012  403 million  of cash on hand was used to repurchase 13421742  ordinary shares which was offset by 358 million  in net proceeds under the tranche a term loan the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to the redemption of membership interests for 4747 million  in 2011 offset by the proceeds received net of repayments from the issuance of debt to partially fund the redemption transaction and the repayment of the senior notes and the old notes of 1689 million  during the year  ended december 31 2011

offbalance sheet arrangements and other matters 

we do not engage in any offbalance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

pension benefits 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary nonus plans are located in france germany mexico portugal and the united kingdom “uk” the uk and certain mexican plans are funded in addition we have defined benefit plans in south korea turkey and italy for which amounts are payable to employees immediately upon separation the obligations for these plans are recorded based on the vested obligation we anticipate making required pension contributions of approximately 70 million for nonus plans in 2013 

delphi sponsors a supplemental executive retirement program “serp” for those employees who were us executives prior to september 30 2008 and were still us executives on october 7 2009 the effective date of the program this program is unfunded executives receive benefits over 5 years after an involuntary or voluntary separation from delphi the serp is closed to new members and was frozen effective september 30 2008 we anticipate making required contributions of approximately 10 million for the serp in 2013

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these 

requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 21 million  of which 3 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 18 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 22 million  of which 5 million  was recorded in accrued liabilities and 17 million  was recorded in other longterm liabilities delphi cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded delphi’s results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

            acquisitions 

          in accordance with accounting guidance for the provisions in fasb asc 805 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill 

          we use all available information to estimate fair values we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 

           our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

           other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be realized accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

warranty obligations 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims government investigations product warranties and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with us gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

environmental matters 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage the cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering financial and legal specialists based on current law and considers the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that where applicable other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments the process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site the complexity of the site the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and if applicable other responsible parties in future periods new laws or regulations advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimated and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are amortized over the average future service period of employees 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 



assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 



we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

delphi does not have any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2012 or 2011 the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2012 expense we assumed a longterm asset rate of return of approximately 625  and 850  for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates 

our pension expense for 2013 is determined at the december 31 2012 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in key assumptions 



the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 12 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we periodically review the recoverability of our longlived and definite lived assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances 

warrant such a review we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

goodwill 

we periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired the company performs impairment reviews at the reporting unit level we perform a qualitative assessment step 0 of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount if not no further goodwill impairment testing is performed if so we perform the step 1 and step 2 tests discussed hereafter if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater  than its carrying amount step 1 goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is not required however if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  than its carrying amount an entity must perform the second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any the second step requires a reporting unit to compare its implied  fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess we review indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired the company does not perform a qualitative assessment step 0 for indefinite lived intangible assets but performs a quantitative review based upon forecasted cash flows similar to goodwill above other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 3 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2012 the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our 

assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 14 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we were in a net derivative asset position of 14 million  and net derivative liability position of 65 million  respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because delphi’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 16 fair value of financial instruments derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

the delphi automotive plc long term incentive plan the “plc ltip” allows for the grant of sharebased awards for longterm compensation to the employees directors consultants and advisors of the company further discussed in note 19 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein in 2012 the grants of restricted stock units “rsus” to delphis executives were made under the plc ltip the rsu awards include a timebased vesting portion and a performancebased vesting portion the performancebased vesting portion includes performance and market conditions in addition to service conditions we determine the grant date fair value of the rsus based on the closing price of the companys ordinary shares on the date of the grant of the award including an estimate for forfeitures and a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist with respect to certain market conditions we recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of the awards applied to the companys best estimate of ultimate performance against the respective targets over the requisite vesting period of the awards the performance conditions require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving certain performance goals changes in these performance assumptions as well as differences in actual results from managements estimates could result in estimated or actual fair values different from previously estimated fair values which could materially impact the companys future results of operations and financial condition 

we expensed the estimated fair value of the value creation plan the vcp a longterm incentive plan for key employees as defined and further discussed in note 19 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein estimating the fair value for the vcp required us to make assumptions regarding the nature of the payout of the award as well as changes in our share price during the postinitial public offering period the awards vested on december 31 2012 the end of the performance period 

refer to note 19 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2012 are described 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 16 fair value of financial instruments derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices currently we do not have any options or instruments with nonlinear returns 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows in some instances we choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the mexican peso chinese yuan renminbi euro turkish lira and polish zloty as of december 31 2012 the net fair value asset of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 839 million and the net fair value asset at december 31 2011 was 844 million the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 168 million and 148 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximately 5 million and approximately 27 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 26 million and 26 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively a 10 change in the net fair value liability differs from a 10 change in rates on fair value due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 13 billion  of floating rate debt principally related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option of either a the abr plus i with respect to the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan 100 per annum or ii with respect to the tranche b term loan 150 per annum or 

b libor plus i with respect to the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan 200 per annum or ii with respect to the tranche b term loan 250 per annum the tranche b term loan includes a libor floor of 100 the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time in increments of 025 to 050 up to a maximum of 10 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings

our history 

in october 2005 the predecessor and certain of its united states “us” subsidiaries collectively the “debtors” filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the “bankruptcy code” in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the “bankruptcy court” collectively the debtors’ october 2005 filings are herein referred to as the “chapter 11 filings” on july 30 2009 the bankruptcy court approved modifications to the first amended joint plan of reorganization of delphi corporation and certain affiliates debtors and debtorsinpossession as modified the “modified plan” which incorporated the master disposition agreement among the predecessor gm component holdings llc motors liquidation company “old gm” general motors company “gm” and dip holdco 3 llc for the sale and purchase of substantially all of the predecessor’s businesses on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” the predecessor emerged from chapter 11 in accordance with the modified plan through the acquisition date the debtors operated their businesses as “debtorsinpossession” under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and orders of the bankruptcy court the predecessor’s nonus subsidiaries were not included in the chapter 11 filings continued their business operations without supervision from the bankruptcy court and were not subject to the requirements of the bankruptcy code 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of the predecessor as discussed below 

on the acquisition date the predecessor i consummated the transactions contemplated by the modified plan and ii exited chapter 11 as dph holdings corp and its subsidiaries and affiliates “dphh” except that 

  

two of the predecessor’s debtor subsidiaries became subsidiaries of delphi automotive llp as a result of the acquisition delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of the predecessor and this business constituted the entirety of the operations of the successor as defined below 

on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion the redemption transaction was funded by a 30 billion credit facility entered into on march 31 2011 the “credit facility” and existing cash

our company 

we believe the automotive industry is being shaped by increasing government regulations for vehicle safety fuel efficiency and emissions control as well as rapidly increasing consumer demand for connectivity these industry mega trends which we refer to as “safe” “green” and “connected” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall we have organized our business into four diversified segments which enable us to develop solutions and manufacture highlyengineered products that enable our customers to respond to these mega trends 

 

  

  

  

 financial information about business segments 

we operate our core business along four operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

  

net sales by segment 

 

 refer to results of operations by segment in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis and note 23 segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report for further financial information about business segments 

our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products our customer base includes 24 of the 25 largest automotive oems in the world and in 2011 23 of our net sales came from emerging markets asia pacific and south america our six largest platforms in 2011 were with six different oems in addition in 2011 our products were found in 17 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the united states in all of the 20 topselling vehicle models in europe and in 13 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in china we have further diversified our business by increasing our sales in the commercial vehicle market which is typically on a different business cycle than the light vehicle market and has grown to 8 of our 2011 net sales in addition approximately 7 of our 2011 net sales were to the aftermarket which meets the ongoing need for replacement parts required for vehicle servicing 

we have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from low cost countries this regional model is structured primarily to service the north american market from mexico the south american market from brazil the european market from eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market from china our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest oems which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global oems require and serve the emerging market oems 

our industry 

the automotive parts industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to oems for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles overall we expect longterm growth of vehicle sales and production in the oem market in 2010 and 2011 the industry has seen increased customer sales and production schedules and an improved sales mix with greater per vehicle content however current oem production volumes in north america and western europe remain substantially lower than oem production volumes prior to the disruptions that the economic and credit markets experienced in 2008 and 2009 demand for automotive parts in the oem market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends although oem demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets we believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities 

  

we believe that continuously increasing demands of society have created the emergence of three “mega trends” that will serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven technology advancement our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these mega trends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both oems and others to produce distinctive marketleading products we have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these “mega trends” where we believe we can provide differentiation to our automotive commercial vehicle and aftermarket customers 

safe  the first megatrend “safe” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring oems continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as the recent proposal by the us national highway traffic safety administration to mandate rear view cameras in all vehicles by 2014 as a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as those that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring examples of new and alternative technologies are lane departure warning systems and collision avoidance technologies which incorporate sophisticated electronics and advanced software 

green  the second megatrend “green” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change higher oil prices increased concern about oil dependence and recent and pending legislation in the us and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions oems continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets on a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in the european union the united states china india japan brazil south korea and argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2016 in many cases the same authorities have initiated legislation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond based on proposed european legislation we believe oems may be required to reduce fleet average co 2 emissions for passenger cars by approximately 20 from 120 gramskilometer or approximately 194 gramsmile in 2012 to 95 gramskilometer or approximately 153 gramsmile by 2020 based on the current regulatory environment we believe that oems in other parts of the world including the us and china will be subject to even greater reductions in co 2 emissions from their current levels over the next ten years these standards will require meaningful innovation as oems and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve thermal management engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains eg electrichybrid engines as a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines at the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions 

connected  the third megatrend “connected” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive so that time in a vehicle is more productive and enjoyable the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving advanced technologies offering mobile voice and data communication while minimizing driver distraction such as those used in our mobile electronics products coupled with global positioning systems and invehicle infotainment will continue to grow in importance and be key products in the transportation industry 

we expect these mega trends to create growth and opportunity for us we believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to oems to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles we 

  

believe electronics integration which generally refers to products that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow oems to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 

standardization of sourcing by oems 

many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend oems are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

shorter product development cycles 

as a result of government regulations and customer preferences oems are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations while these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet the oem demands for rapid innovation

we typically supply products to our oem customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each oem although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles these relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle prices are negotiated with respect to each purchase order which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the oem to the enduser of the vehicle we may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the oem recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products 

individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events in addition many of our oem customers have the option to terminate for convenience which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and have the ability to issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts additionally our largest customer gm expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts we manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels 

although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of oem production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for oem orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders the dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the timeframe involved 

  

our global operations 

information concerning principal geographic areas for our continuing operations is set forth below net sales data reflects the manufacturing location for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 the periods from august 19 to december 31 2009 and january 1 to october 6 2009 net property data is as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  

 research development and intellectual property 

we maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis as of december 31 2011 we employed over 17000 scientists engineers and technicians around the world total expenditures for research and development activities which include engineering were approximately 12 billion 10 billion 03 billion and 10 billion for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 the period from august 19 to december 31 2009 and the period from january 1 to october 6 2009 respectively each year we share some engineering expenses with oems and government agencies while this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 20 to 25 of engineering expenses 

we believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market we believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology we maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies we expect expenditures for engineering activities to be approximately 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 

we maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business while no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide 

  

meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations similarly while our trademarks particularly those protecting the delphi brand are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests these activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights 

materials 

we procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs the most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include aluminum copper and resins as of december 31 2011 we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 

commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper aluminum petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry we are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means in the case of copper which primarily affects our electricalelectronic architecture segment and aluminum which primarily affects our thermal segment contract escalation clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products however other than in the case of copper and aluminum our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited we will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire 

seasonality 

our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically halt operations for approximately two weeks in july and approximately one week in december our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and for one week in december shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country in addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of july august and september due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models accordingly our results reflect this seasonality 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 104000 people 5000 in the us and 99000 outside of the us 24000 salaried employees and 80000 hourly employees in addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 39000 contract and temporary workers our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the iuecwa the united steel paper and forestry rubber manufacturing energy allied industrial and service workers international union and its local union 87l together the “usw” and confederacion de trabajadores mexicanos in the us our employees are represented by only the iuecwa and the usw with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages 

environmental compliance 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and 

  

support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

at december 31 2011 december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 22 million 23 million and 21 million respectively of which 7 million 8 million and 5 million respectively related to sites within the us we cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the company also refer to the cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information in this annual report 

risks related to business environment and economic conditions 

the cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business 

our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences lower global automotive sales result in substantially all of our automotive oem customers significantly lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows the most recent example of this was the 2009 downturn in which north american and western europe automotive production declined approximately 43 and 26 respectively below production levels in 2007 while the industry is recovering from the 2009 downturn production volumes in north america and western europe remain below levels experienced prior to 2009 in addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our sales are also affected by inventory levels and oems’ production levels we cannot predict when oems will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

a prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available 

our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows if global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products if vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business 

declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues 

we are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers our customers generally are oems in the automotive industry this industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns when our customers 

  

are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products as a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

the mix of vehicle offerings by our oem customers also impacts our sales a decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions 

declines in the market share or business of daimler ford gm psa and vw may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

daimler ford gm psa and vw accounted for approximately 47 of our total net sales in the year ended december 31 2011 accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows see item 1 supply relationships with our customers 

continued pricing pressures oem cost reduction initiatives and the ability of oems to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business 

costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year in addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions oems have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity based on these factors and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing accordingly as a tier i supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from oems to reduce the price of our products it is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as oems pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

our supply agreements with our oem customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

we receive oem purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles in most instances our oem customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us the contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could 

  

have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected see item 1 supply relationships with our customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 

we have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized 

our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base we have identified the asia pacific and south american regions and china brazil and india in particular as key markets likely to experience substantial growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in those regions if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 

our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions 

maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy the automotive supply market in china is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china if we are unable to maintain our position in the chinese market or if vehicle sales in china decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability 

we and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper aluminum and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors a significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins 

we as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “justintime” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels our suppliers also use a similar method however this “justintime” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions 

such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more additionally as we grow in low cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened the lack of even a 

  

small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components this may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance 

when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products generally we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up” such as overtime and premium freight 

additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us these losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all 

adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability 

any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect to the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks 

the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance 

although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products the loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

we operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry 

the global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete may attract new entrants particularly in lowcost countries such as china brazil india and russia additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us as a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from oems and pricing actions of competitors these factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future in addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements as a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products these trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products 

  

increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business 

significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases in recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition we will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic oems and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so the inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability we expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in china brazil india and russia and by the anticipated global economic recovery we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs 

in order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production the results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results 

we face manufacturing challenges 

the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers’ products our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged 

from time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines this excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect 

  

on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns if we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in china or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs and political social and economic instability 

we may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products 

changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues we cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products 

to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and costeffective manner our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including in the case of automotive sales increased gasoline prices or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles using alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance 

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results 

changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonus pension liabilities may adversely affect us 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service our primary nonus plans are located in mexico and the united kingdom and were underfunded by 319 million as of december 31 2011 the funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation in addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate these legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 609 million at december 31 2011 of which 16 million is included in accrued liabilities and 593 million is included in longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition 

  

include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets if the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges 

we have taken restructuring actions in recent years to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements if we are required to take further restructuring actions the charges related to these actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we cannot assure that any future restructurings will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facility’s building fixed assets and production tooling we cannot assure that we will not incur such charges in the future 

employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations 

our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees a strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business a labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability a labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability in addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability 

we may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel 

an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package we may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate approximately 69 of our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect net revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 

historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions however any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective 

  

in addition we have significant business in europe and transact much of this business in the euro currency including sales and purchase contracts there have been recent concerns over the stability of the euro as a currency and the economic outlook for both euro functional countries as well as noneuro countries given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations in the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the euro the potential impact could be material to operations we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations 

we face risks associated with doing business in nonus jurisdictions 

the majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the us including mexico and countries in asia pacific eastern and western europe south america and northern africa we also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 69 of our net revenue came from sales outside the united states international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing our manufacturing footprint in asian markets including china and our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our strategy in addition our strategy includes 

  

increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions as a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 

if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any future acquisition or strategic alliance into our business our business could be harmed 

we expect to pursue acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses while we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities such risks and uncertainties include difficulty in integrating acquired operations technology and products and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired company 

we depend on information technology to conduct our business any significant disruption could impact our business 

our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems we rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged we are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers and redundant infrastructure a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively an incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our ordinary shares 

the price of our ordinary shares is subject to volatility 

various factors could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to fluctuate substantially including general financial market changes regional economic environments changes in governmental regulation significant automotive industry announcements or developments the introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors and changes in other conditions or trends in the automotive industry other factors that could cause the price of our ordinary shares to fluctuate could be actual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors’ quarterly and annual financial results financial results failing to meet expectations of analysts or investors changes in securities analysts’ estimates of the our future performance or of that of our competitors and the general health of the automotive industry also the increase or decrease to the number of freely tradable shares in the public market could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to fluctuate 

future sales of ordinary shares by existing shareholders could depress the market price of our ordinary shares 

we have 328244510 ordinary shares outstanding of which 114549400 ordinary shares are freely tradable in the public market unless purchased by any of our affiliates including the 90470573 shares that were released from lockup restrictions on february 14 2012 and registered for resale under the securities act we expect the remaining 213695110 ordinary shares representing approximately 65 of our total outstanding ordinary shares will become available for resale in the public market in may 2012 the holders of all the remaining 213695110 ordinary shares including our directors remain subject to lockup restrictions until may 15 2012 the lockup 

  

agreements are subject to extension in the case of an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us goldman sachs  co and jp morgan securities llc may in their sole discretion and without notice release all or any portion of the ordinary shares subject to lockup agreements as restrictions on resale end the market price of our ordinary shares could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them we are required to file a shelf registration statement prior to expiration of the lockup period on may 15 2012 to permit the resale of such remaining shares any such shares not registered for resale will be freely tradable subject to volume and manner of sale requirements on may 22 2012 the increase or decrease to the number of freely tradable shares in the public market could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to fluctuate and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our ordinary shares or other securities 

risks related to legal regulatory tax and accounting matters 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims and product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage the fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards if flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to 

 

  

  

  

  

 all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers however as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions oems continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims a recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business oems also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the oem asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate however the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

  

in addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights we cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 

we may be adversely affected by environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities 

we are subject to various us federal state and local and nonus environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things 

 

  

  

  

 we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits if we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage 

certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated at this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities in the us and abroad the ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties while we have environmental reserves of approximately 22 million at december 31 2011 for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves we also could be named a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material 

in addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition for example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy 

we may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities 

as we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed we may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further 

  

delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of polychlorinated biphenyls or storage tanks such costs could exceed our reserves 

we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

we are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters there is also a pending antitrust investigation in the european union 

in addition we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances as of december 31 2011 related claims totaling approximately 225 million using december 31 2011 foreign currency rates had been asserted against us as of december 31 2011 we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 40 million using december 31 2011 foreign currency rates 

we are also subject to class action complaints filed in various us federal district courts alleging violations of us antitrust laws and are subject to a pending antitrust investigation in the european union related to the supply of wire harnesses to vehicle manufacturers for which no accruals have been recorded as of december 31 2011 

while we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

for further information regarding our legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings no assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position 

developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business 

we own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition 

there is a significant risk that the irs will assert that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes if we were unsuccessful in defending against this assertion this could result in a material impact on our future tax liability 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders 

  

all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc delphi automotive plc is a united kingdom “uk” resident taxpayer and as such is not generally subject to uk tax on remitted foreign earnings 

delphi automotive llp which acquired the automotive supply and other businesses of the predecessor on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” was established on august 19 2009 as a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of england and wales at the time of its formation delphi automotive llp elected to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes prior to the acquisition date the internal revenue service the “irs” issued notice 200978 the “notice” announcing its intent to issue regulations under section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” with an effective date prior to the acquisition date if regulations as described in the notice are issued with the effective date indicated in the notice and with no exceptions for transactions that were subject to binding commitments on that date we believe there is a significant risk that the irs may assert that delphi automotive llp and as a result delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes retroactive to the acquisition date if delphi automotive llp were treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we expect that although we are incorporated under the laws of jersey and a tax resident in the uk we would also be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

delphi automotive llp has filed informational us federal partnership tax returns for 2009 and 2010 in light of the notice the irs is currently reviewing whether section 7874 applies to delphi automotive llp’s acquisition of the automotive supply and other businesses of the predecessor we believe after consultation with counsel that neither delphi automotive llp nor delphi automotive plc should be treated as domestic corporations for us federal income tax purposes and intends to vigorously defend any assertion by the irs to the contrary including through litigation if we were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution with the irs however no assurance can be given that the irs will not contend or that a court will not conclude that neither delphi automotive llp and therefore delphi automotive plc should be treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2011 

if we were treated as a domestic corporation for us federal income tax purposes we would be subject to us federal income tax on our worldwide taxable income including some or all of the distributions from our subsidiaries as well as some of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that constitute “controlled foreign corporations” this could have a material adverse impact on our future tax liability related to these distributions and earnings future cash distributions made by us to nonus shareholders could be subject to us income tax withholding at a rate of 30 unless reduced or eliminated by a tax treaty in addition we could be liable for additional us federal income taxes on such distributions and earnings and for the failure by delphi automotive llp to withhold us income taxes on distributions to its nonus members for periods beginning on or after the acquisition date which liability could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions 

the amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws in particular we will seek to run ourselves in such a way that we are and remain tax resident in the united kingdom while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our application of acquisition accounting could result in additional asset impairments and may make comparisons of our financial position and results of operations to prior periods more difficult 

as required by us gaap we recognized and measured the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from the predecessor this resulted in the recognition of significant identifiable intangible assets which could be impaired in future periods additionally the consolidated financial statements of delphi automotive plc are not comparable to the consolidated statements of the predecessor due to the effects of the consummation of the first amended joint plan of reorganization of delphi corporation and certain affiliates debtors and debtorsin possession as modified and the change in the basis of presentation this lack of comparability could limit interest and investment in our securities including the ordinary shares 

our operating results are exposed to variability as a result of the currently designed long term incentive program for our key employees 

the recognition of compensation costs on a us gaap basis resulting from the execution of our value creation plan our long term incentive program for key employees is based on a variable formula that is likely to result in fluctuations impacting operating results no assurance can be given that such impacts will not have a material impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

we have no unresolved sec staff comments to report 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2011 we owned or leased 114 major manufacturing sites and 15 major technical centers in 30 countries a manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased we also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world the following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities 

 

 in addition to these manufacturing sites we had 15 major technical centers five in north america five in europe middle east and africa four in asia pacific and one in south america 

of our 114 major manufacturing sites and 15 major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 71 are primarily owned and 58 are primarily leased 

delphi operates administrative offices in troy michigan we also maintain regional offices in sao paulo brazil shanghai china and bascharage luxembourg 

we frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses we believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to various legal actions and claims incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts product warranties intellectual property matters and employmentrelated matters it is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements however the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 

european union antitrust investigation 

we have received requests for information from antitrust authorities at the european commission seeking information about alleged conduct by us in connection with an investigation of automotive parts suppliers concerning possible violations of antitrust laws related to the supply of wire harnesses to vehicle manufacturers we are cooperating fully with the european authorities investigations of this nature often continue for several years and may result in fines imposed by the european authorities any fine could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows however at this time we are unable to estimate any reasonably possible range of loss that may ultimately result from this investigation no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2011 

class action antitrust litigation 

a number of class action complaints have been filed in various us federal district courts alleging that several wire harness manufacturers including us have violated us antitrust laws these complaints allege that consumers overpaid for their vehicles as a result of the alleged conduct of the wire harness manufacturers at this time we believe that the allegations contained in the complaints are without merit with regard to us and we intend to vigorously defend against the allegations set forth in the complaints no accruals for these matters have been recorded as of december 31 2011 

unsecured creditors litigation 

in december 2011 a complaint was filed in the bankruptcy court alleging that the redemption by delphi automotive llp of the membership interests of gm and the pbgc our initial public offering and a distribution by delphi automotive llp in the amount of 95 million principally in respect of taxes constituted in the aggregate distributions to the members of delphi automotive llp in excess of 72 billion the complaint further alleges that such aggregate distributions obligate delphi automotive llp to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against the predecessor 3250 for every 6750 in excess of 72 billion in distributions up to a maximum of 300 million at this time we believe that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and we intend to vigorously contest the allegations set forth in the complaint no accrual for this matter has been recorded as of december 31 2011 

warranty matters 

in 2009 we received information regarding potential warranty claims related to certain components supplied by our powertrain segment in march 2011 we reached a settlement with our customer related to this matter during the three months ended march 31 2011 we recognized an unusual warranty expense in cost of sales of approximately 76 million as a result of the settlement agreement in april 2011 delphi made a payment of €90 million approximately 133 million at april 30 2011 foreign currency rates related to this matter 

we have recognized our best estimate for our total aggregate warranty reserves across all of our operating segments as of december 31 2011 the estimated reasonably possible amounts to ultimately resolve all matters is not materially different from the recorded reserves 

  

brazil matters 

we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws while we believe that we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances in addition we are also a party to commercial and labor litigation with private parties as of december 31 2011 related claims totaling approximately 225 million using december 31 2011 foreign currency rates have been asserted against us as of december 31 2011 we maintain accruals for these asserted claims of approximately 40 million using december 31 2011 foreign currency rates the amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on our analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters while we believe our accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected 

romania value added tax “vat” assessment 

during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of a tax audit for years 2006–2008 we received a tax assessment from the romanian tax authorities in the amount of approximately 42 million based on the taxing authority’s assessment that we underpaid its vat mostly on export sales by approximately 24 million and owe accrued interest and penalties of 18 million we filed an appeal contesting the assessment and in october 2010 the romanian tax authorities substantially reduced the amount of the assessment and decided to reaudit us in december 2011 the company received 13 million from the tax authorities related to the outstanding vat credit as of december 31 2011 we maintain a reserve for this contingency that is substantially less than the amount of the remaining balance under assessment while we believe our reserve is adequate the final amounts required to resolve this initial assessment could differ materially from our recorded estimate

leveraging our engineering and technological prowess  we seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key mega trends with our global footprint to increase our revenues as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in each of our product lines 

capitalizing on our scale global footprint and established position in emerging markets  we intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate we anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on the fastgrowing automotive markets particularly in china brazil india and russia in addition our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards emerging markets 

leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow  we recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry our focus is on maximizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements 

  

with minimal additions to our fixedcost base additionally we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract 

pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic alliances  we intend to pursue selected transactions that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses 

trends uncertainties and opportunities 

rate of economic recovery  our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers automotive sales depend on a number of factors including economic conditions the economy is recovering slowly from a recession that began in late 2007 and became increasingly severe with the global credit crisis in 2008 and 2009 the weaker economic conditions led to a substantial industrywide decline in vehicle sales in 2008 and 2009 however global automotive vehicle production increased over 3 from 2010 to 2011 and is expected to increase by an additional 5 to 6 in 2012 any future economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally volatility in oil and gasoline prices negatively impacts consumer confidence and automotive sales as well as the mix of future sales from trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller fuelefficient passenger cars while our diversified customer and geographic revenue base have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns shifts to vehicles with less content would adversely impact our profitability 

emerging markets growth  rising income levels in the emerging markets of china brazil india and russia are resulting in stronger growth rates in these markets our strong global presence and presence in these markets have positioned us to experience abovemarket growth rates we continue to expand our established presence in emerging markets positioning us to benefit from the expected growth opportunities in these regions we will accomplish this by capitalizing on our longstanding relationships with the global oems and further enhancing our positions with the emerging market oems to continue expanding our worldwide leadership we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on the fastgrowing automotive markets particularly china brazil india and russia we believe that our presence in low cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the emerging markets 

we have a strong presence in china where we have operated for nearly 20 years all of our business segments have operations and sales in china as a result we have wellestablished relationships with all of the major oems in china we generated approximately 2 billion in revenue from china in 2011 with only 21 of our 33 offered products currently locally manufactured we believe we have the opportunity to expand additional product lines into china and as a result we see further growth potential 

market driven products  our product offerings satisfy the oems’ need to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and fulfill consumer preferences for products that address the mega trends of safe green and connected leading to increased content per vehicle greater profitability and higher margins with these offerings we believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on demand for increased safety fuel efficiency emissions control and connectivity to the global information network there has been a substantial increase in vehicle content and electrification requiring a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate such as hybrid power electronics electrical vehicle monitoring lane departure warning systems integrated electronic displays navigation systems and consumer electronics our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution andor consumption is key to satisfying the oems’ need to reduce emissions while continuing to meet the demands of consumers additionally our powertrain systems and thermal systems segments are also focused on addressing the demand for increased fuel efficiency and emission control by controlling fuel consumption and heat dissipation which are principal factors influencing fuel efficiency and emissions 

  

global capabilities  many oems are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability as a result oems are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend our global footprint enables us to serve the global oems on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with the emerging market oems this regional model has largely migrated to service the north american market out of mexico the south american market out of brazil the european market out of eastern europe and north africa and the asia pacific market out of china 

product development  the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive both domestically and internationally our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have well positioned us to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands 

oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs as a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers tier i suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing 

engineering design  development  our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers we have a team of more than 17000 scientists engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets located at 15 major technical centers in brazil china france germany india luxembourg mexico poland south korea the united kingdom and the united states we invest approximately 1 billion annually in research and development including engineering to maintain our portfolio of innovative products and currently own approximately 5500 patents we also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry government agencies and academic institutions our technology competencies are recognized by both customers and government agencies who have coinvested approximately 400 million of additional funds annually in new product development increasing our total spend accordingly accelerating the pace of innovation and reducing the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs 

in the past suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering designing and developing automotive component parts and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes recently we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes this trend reduces our economic risk 

pricing  costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the periods of production and oems have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive oems our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions 

in 2010 we largely completed our restructuring activities resulting in a lower fixed cost base improved manufacturing footprint and reduced overhead we dramatically reduced our us and western european footprints realigned our selling general and administrative cost structure and increased the variable nature of our employee base as a result approximately 90 of our hourly workforce is located in low cost countries furthermore we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of temporary workers 

  

which represented approximately 32 of the hourly workforce as of december 31 2011 we are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost base to minimize our net income before depreciation and amortization including longlived asset and goodwill impairment interest expense other income expense net income tax expense and equity income net of tax “ebitda” breakeven which we estimate to be approximately 38 below the current production volumes assuming constant product mix and based on 2011 results we believe that our lean cost structure will allow us to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle 

efficient use of capital  the global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs 

industry consolidation  consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships as oems continue to expand globally we believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of the industry consolidation trend we have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately 21 billion and substantial liquidity of approximately 27 billion of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our revolving credit facility as defined below in liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 2011 and no significant us defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employerpaid postretirement basic life insurance benefits “opeb” liabilities we intend to maintain strong financial discipline targeting industryleading earnings growth cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle 

our history and structure 

on august 19 2009 delphi automotive llp a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of england and wales was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and subsidiaries of the former delphi corporation our predecessor which along with certain of its us subsidiaries had filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy in october 2005 on october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of the predecessor other than the global steering business the us manufacturing facilities in which the hourly employees were represented by the uaw and certain nonproductive us assets and delphi automotive llp issued membership interests to a group of investors consisting of lenders to the predecessor gm and the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” for additional information see note 1 general to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

on march 31 2011 all of the outstanding class a and class c membership interests held by gm and the pbgc were redeemed respectively for approximately 44 billion the redemption transaction was funded by a 30 billion credit facility entered into on march 31 2011 the “credit facility” and existing cash 

on may 19 2011 delphi automotive plc was formed as a jersey public limited company and had nominal assets no liabilities and had conducted no operations prior to its initial public offering on november 22 2011 in conjunction with the completion of its initial public offering by the selling shareholders all of the outstanding equity of delphi automotive llp was exchanged for ordinary shares in delphi automotive plc as a result delphi automotive llp became a whollyowned subsidiary of delphi automotive plc 

disposition of the predecessor and acquisition accounting 

on october 6 2009 the “acquisition date” the predecessor i consummated the transactions contemplated by the modified plan as defined in note 1 general to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and ii exited chapter 11 as dph holdings corp and its subsidiaries and affiliates 

  

“dphh” except that two of the predecessor’s debtor subsidiaries became subsidiaries of delphi automotive llp a summary of significant terms of the modified plan follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of the acquisition we acquired the major portion of the business of the predecessor and this business constituted the entirety of the operations of the successor accordingly as required under the applicable accounting guidance the financial information set forth herein reflects the consolidated results of operations of the successor for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 and the period from its incorporation on august 19 2009 to december 31 2009 and of the predecessor for the period from january 1 2009 to october 6 2009 delphi automotive llp had no material or substantive transactions from its organization on august 19 2009 to the acquisition date 

in 2009 the predecessor recognized a gain of approximately 102 billion for reorganization items as a result of the process of reorganizing the debtors as defined and further discussed in note 1 general to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code this gain reflects the extinguishment of liabilities subject to compromise opeb settlement and the sale disposition of the predecessor offset by the pbgc termination of the us pension plans and professional fees directly related to the reorganization 

we have recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from the predecessor at estimated fair values in accordance with the guidance in fasb asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  the fair values were estimated based on valuations performed by an independent valuation specialist utilizing three generally accepted business valuation approaches for additional information see note 1 general to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

in connection with the acquisition we did not acquire all of the assets or assume all of the liabilities of the predecessor as noted above the assets we acquired and the liabilities we assumed from the predecessor were generally recorded at fair value resulting in a change from the predecessor’s basis accordingly our consolidated financial statements are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements of the predecessor due to the effects of the consummation of the modified plan for these reasons we do not generally present 

  

financial information on a combined basis for the predecessor period from january 1 to october 6 2009 and the successor period from august 19 to december 31 2009 “full year 2009” except as noted below we have compared consolidated net sales and ebitda of the successor for the year ended december 31 2010 to the total net sales and adjusted ebitda for the full year 2009 we believe these comparisons are most meaningful and useful in providing a thorough understanding of the financial statements where applicable “operations not acquired” is included in the tables below explaining the variance attributable to the acquisition by gm on october 6 2009 of the manufacturing facilities in the us at which the hourly employees were represented by the uaw 

consolidated results of operations 

our improved total net sales during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 reflect the impacts of increased oem production volumes as well as the level of our content per unit and to a lesser extent the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although global oem production volumes increased over 3 for the year ended december 31 2011 versus 2010 excluding production decreases from japan and japanese oem production in north america of 9 resulting from the japan earthquake and tsunami global oem production volumes increased 6 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 we did not experience any significant adverse impacts resulting from the japan earthquake and tsunami particularly given that the japanese oems are not among our principal customers to the extent that the japanese oems grow faster than others as they make up for lost production in 2011 we would expect that our volume growth from our oem customers could be slower than the market 

the improvements in oem production volumes continue to indicate a stabilization of the global economy however current oem production volumes in north america and western europe continue to be substantially less than oem production volumes prior to the disruptions in the economic and credit markets experienced in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the significant restructuring actions implemented by the predecessor and continued by us in 2010 our reduced cost structure is enabling us to translate the total net sales growth achieved in 2011 into strong gross margin and improved operating earnings 

significant issues affected the predecessor’s financial performance in 2009 including a depressed global vehicle production environment for oems pricing pressures and increasingly volatile commodity prices in addition the predecessor was adversely impacted by legacy us labor liabilities which included noncompetitive wage and benefit levels and restrictive collectivelybargained labor agreement provisions which historically inhibited the predecessor’s responsiveness to market conditions including exiting nonstrategic nonprofitable operations or flexing the size of the unionized workforce when volume decreases also during 2009 the predecessor’s operational challenges intensified as a result of the continued downturn in general economic conditions including reduced consumer spending and confidence high oil prices and the credit market crisis all of which resulted in global vehicle manufacturers reducing production and taking other restructuring actions 

we benefited from the restructuring initiatives implemented throughout the last several years and in particular in 2009 from the restructuring of the business that took place through the acquisition of the predecessor’s global steering business and the uaw manufacturing facilities by gm together with its subsidiaries and affiliates in the us as of the acquisition date as defined and further discussed below in addition we benefited from the increase in oem production volumes beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009 and continuing throughout 2010 and 2011 our results of operations include the effects of the improvement in the cost structure and the operating leverage we can now employ with improvements in oem production volumes versus the predecessor while production volume levels improved in 2011 and 2010 as compared to the production volume levels experienced in 2009 we continued to face challenges with production volumes globally still significantly lower than 2007 due to the lingering effects from the disruptions in the economy and credit markets in 2008 and 2009 and volatile commodity prices as a result of the acquisition beginning in 2010 we incurred and expect to incur incremental annual noncash amortization charges of approximately 80 million related to the recognition of acquired intangible assets additionally in conjunction with the initial public offering in november 2011 we incurred transactionrelated fees and recognized expenses in the year ended december 31 2011 of approximately 44 million 

  

we typically experience fluctuations in revenue due to changes in oem production schedules vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business which we refer to collectively as volume increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs which we refer to as commodity passthrough fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which we refer to as fx contractual reductions of the sales price to the oem which we refer to as contractual price reductions and engineering changes changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth shifts in oem sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration for instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular oem’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue a shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue 

we typically experience as described below fluctuations in operating income due to 

 

  

  

 the automotive component supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which have placed and will continue to place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future in addition we expect commodity cost volatility particularly related to copper aluminum and petroleumbased resin products to have a continual impact on future earnings andor operating cash flows as such we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our materialrelated cost exposures using a number of approaches including combining purchase requirements with customers andor other suppliers using alternate suppliers or product designs negotiating cost reductions andor commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging 

  

2011 versus 2010 

the results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

 

 total net sales 

below is a summary of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 versus december 31 2010 

 

 total net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 16 compared to year ended december 31 2010 the increase in total net sales resulted primarily from increased volume as a result of improved oem production schedules in 2011 as well as the level of our content per unit and to a lesser extent the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the euro additionally included in other above are decreased sales of approximately 120 million related to divestitures that occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 

operating results 

the information below summarizes the operating results for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

  

cost of sales 

cost of sales is primarily comprised of material labor manufacturing overhead freight fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates product engineering design and development expenses depreciation and amortization warranty costs and other operating expenses gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percent of net sales cost of sales increased 1618 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 as summarized below 

 

  

 the increase in cost of sales was driven by increases in volume and the following items in other above 

 

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by improved operational performance as well as 94 million related to divested businesses primarily the occupant protection systems business on march 31 2010 

selling general and administrative expense 

 

 selling general and administrative expense “sga” includes administrative expenses information technology costs and incentive compensation related costs and declined as a percent of sales during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 2010 due to maintaining administrative and information technology cost increases at or lower than the increasing rate of net sales increases in sga were largely attributable to foreign exchange effects and increased accruals for incentive compensation of 29 million including the accelerated vesting of board of directors shares upon our initial public offering 

amortization 

 

   

amortization expense reflects the noncash charge related to definitelived intangible assets primarily recognized as part of the acquisition 

restructuring 

 

 the decrease in restructuring expense is due to a decline in workforce reductions and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes including plant closures in the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 as we had largely completed our significant restructuring programs by the end of 2010 

refer to note 11 restructuring to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

interest expense 

 

 the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 is due to changes in debt balances primarily related to the borrowings under the credit agreement the “credit agreement” and issuance of the 500 million of 5875 senior notes due 2019 and 500 million of 6125 senior notes due 2021 collectively the “senior notes” in conjunction with the redemption of the class a and class c membership interests 

refer to note 12 debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

other expense income net 

 

 the increase in other expense for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to other income for the year ended december 31 2010 was primarily the result of incurring approximately 44 million in transaction costs related to our initial public offering in november 2011 and an increase of 8 million loss on extinguishment of debt 

refer to note 18 other income expense net to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

  

income taxes 

 

 the effective tax rate was 20 and 27 in 2011 and 2010 respectively the company’s tax rate is affected by the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the company operates the relative amount of income earned by jurisdiction and the relative amount of losses or income for which no tax benefit or expense was recognized due to a valuation allowance in 2011 tax incentives of 64 million were obtained in various nonus countries primarily hitech enterprise status in china and the maquiladora regime in mexico and a 65 million tax benefit for income earned in jurisdictions where a valuation allowance has been recorded primarily in france 

we recognized a 52 million primarily germany and 21 million tax benefit in 2011 and 2010 respectively related to changes in judgment of valuation allowances for the realization of deferred tax assets during 2011 the company recorded a withholding tax of 10 million related to the funding of the redemption of all the outstanding class a and class c membership interests and 27 million related to changes in our assertion with respect to our intent to repatriate foreign earnings in certain countries 

our annual effective tax rate may be impacted by future events including changes in tax laws geographic income mix cash requirements tax audits closure of tax years legal entity restructuring and changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets our effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from quarter to quarter resulting from interim reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events 

equity income 

 

 equity income reflects our interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equitymethod investments equity income increased during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 partially due to the recognition of 8 million of gain on the sale of our 495 interest in daesung electric co ltd as well as improved performance at our mexican and korean joint ventures these increases were partially offset by a 7 million impairment charge related to a european joint venture 

results of operations by segment 

we operate our core business along the following operating segments which are grouped on the basis of similar product market and operating factors 

 

  

   

  

  

 through december 31 2010 we evaluated performance based on standalone segment adjusted ebitda and accounted for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at current market prices our management believed that adjusted ebitda was a meaningful measure of performance and it was used by management to analyze company and standalone segment operating performance management also used adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting purposes effective january 1 2011 our management began utilizing segment ebitda as a key performance measure because our restructuring was substantially completed by the end of 2010 segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered substitutes for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to delphi which is the most directly comparable financial measure to ebitda and adjusted ebitda that is in accordance with us gaap segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda as determined and measured by us should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the reconciliation of ebitda to net income attributable to delphi for the year ended december 31 2011 is as follows 

 

 for the year ended december 31 2010 the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to ebitda includes other restructuring costs related to 1 the implementation of projects aimed at reducing the cost and improving the functionality of information technology systems to support finance manufacturing and product development initiatives 2 certain plant consolidations and closures costs 3 continued consolidation of many staff administrative activities and 4 employee benefit plan settlements in mexico 

  

the reconciliation of ebitda to net income attributable to delphi for the year ended december 31 2010 is as follows 

 

 net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales and ebitda by segment for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 are as follows 

net sales by segment 

 

  

   

gross margin percentage by segment 

 

 ebitda by segment 

 

 as noted in the table above ebitda for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2010 was impacted by volume and contractual price reductions and operational performance improvements as well as the following items included in other in the table above

 cost of sales in the successor period of 2009 was impacted by higher volume offset by favorable operational performance and our reduced cost structure due to previous restructuring actions additionally cost of sales was impacted by the following items 

 

  

  

  

 predecessor 

cost of sales in the predecessor period of 2009 was impacted by the relatively fixed cost nature of the predecessor’s operations that inhibited the predecessor’s ability to adjust its cost structure appropriately to the reduced volumes resulting from the economic and credit crises of 2008 and 2009 that adversely impacted oem production levels additionally cost of sales was impacted by the following items 

 

  

  

   

selling general and administrative expense 

 

 successor 

sga continued to decline as a percent of sales in the year ended december 31 2010 and the successor period of 2009 as compared to the predecessor period of 2009 as a result of the positive effects of cost savings initiatives 

predecessor 

during the predecessor period of 2009 the impact of cost saving and restructuring initiatives had not yet been fully realized in addition reduced volumes during 2009 resulted in sga being a larger percentage of net sales due to the fixed nature of certain sga costs 

amortization 

 

 successor 

amortization for the year ended december 31 2010 and the successor period of 2009 is a result of the recognition at fair value of approximately 766 million of intangible assets that we acquired as a part of the acquisition

environmental matters 

we are subject to the requirements of us federal state and local and nonus environmental and safety and health laws and regulations these include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not be material 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances in addition to cleanup actions brought by us federal state local and nonus agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property we are currently in the process of investigating and cleaning up some of our current or former sites in addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 22 million of which 5 million was recorded in accrued liabilities and 17 million was recorded in other longterm liabilities and 23 million of which 5 million was recorded in accrued liabilities and 18 million was recorded in other longterm liabilities respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected 

legal proceedings 

for a description of our legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings and note 14 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our evaluation of trends in the industry information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 acquisition accounting 

upon the acquisition the recorded amounts for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from the predecessor were adjusted to reflect estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc 805 

  

business combinations  the fair values were estimated in accordance with the guidance in fasb asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  and were based on three generally accepted business valuation approaches the income market and cost approaches generally the income and market approaches were used and weighted by the independent valuation specialists as appropriate 

the discounted cash flow “dcf” method is a form of the income approach commonly used to value business interests the dcf method was based on companyprepared projections which included a variety of estimates and assumptions while we consider such estimates and assumptions reasonable they are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and therefore may not be realized changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a significant effect on the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition accordingly there can be no assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially 

other estimates used in determining fair value include but are not limited to future cash flows or income related to intangibles market rate assumptions actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain acquisition accounting along with the consummation of the modified plan and the disposition of the predecessor has had a material effect on the financial statements refer to note 1 general to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

warranty obligations 

estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 the stated or implied warranty period 2 oem source 3 oem policy decisions regarding warranty claims and 4 oems seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties these estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations 

legal and other contingencies 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims including commercial or contractual disputes product liability claims and environmental and other matters that arise in the normal course of business we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with us gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 

environmental matters 

environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage the cost of each environmental remediation is estimated by engineering financial and legal specialists based on current law and considers the 

  

estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that where applicable other responsible parties will be able to fulfill their legal obligations and commitments the process of estimating environmental remediation liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site the complexity of the site the uncertainty as to what remediation and technology will be required and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and if applicable other responsible parties in future periods new laws or regulations advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates refer to note 14 commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of current reserves in the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected 

restructuring 

accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions these accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes actual costs may vary from these estimates these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 

pensions 

we use actuarial estimated and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions which are determined based on current market conditions historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers refer to note 13 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 discount rates 2 asset return assumptions and 3 actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate experience gains and losses as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are amortized over the average future service period of employees 

the principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the us and nonus pension plans were 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 

 

 assumptions used to determine net expense for years ended december 31 

 

   

we select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of highquality fixed income investments rated aa or higher by standard and poor’s 

in 2011 we no longer had any us pension assets therefore no us asset rate of return calculation was necessary for 2011 the primary funded nonus plans are in the united kingdom and mexico for the determination of 2011 expense we assumed a longterm asset rate of return of approximately 625 and 950 for the united kingdom and mexico respectively we evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns in developing the longterm rate of return assumptions the assumptions for the united kingdom and mexico are primarily conservative longterm prospective rates 

our pension expense for 2012 is determined at the december 31 2011 measurement date for purposes of analysis the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in key assumptions 

 

 the above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear the above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs 

based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable however changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 pension benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

accounts receivable allowance 

establishing valuation allowances for doubtful accounts requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon analysis of trade receivables for known collectability issues including bankruptcies and aging of receivables at the end of each period changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded allowance 

valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and investments in affiliates and expected useful lives 

we periodically review the recoverability of our longlived and indefinitelived assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review we estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals the key factors which impact our estimates are 1 future production estimates 2 customer preferences and decisions 3 product pricing 4 manufacturing and material cost estimates and 5 product life  business retention any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition we believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable however changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations 

  

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a firstin firstout basis or market including direct material costs and direct and indirect manufacturing costs refer to note 4 inventories to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein obsolete inventory is identified based on analysis of inventory for known obsolescence issues and as of december 31 2011 the market value of inventory on hand in excess of one year’s supply is generally fullyreserved 

from time to time payments may be received from suppliers these payments from suppliers are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the material acquired during the period to which the payments relate in some instances supplier rebates are received in conjunction with or concurrent with the negotiation of future purchase agreements and these amounts are amortized over the prospective agreement period 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods 

when establishing a valuation allowance we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies” a tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that is prudent and feasible an enterprise ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused and would result in realization of deferred tax assets” in the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability changes in our estimates due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks facts and circumstances existing at that time we use a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made we report taxrelated interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate refer to note 15 income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

fair value measurement of derivative instruments 

in determining the fair value of our derivatives we utilize valuation techniques as prescribed by fasb asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures  and also prioritize the use of observable inputs the availability of observable inputs varies amongst derivatives and depends on the type of derivative and how 

  

actively traded the derivative is for many of our derivatives the valuation does not require significant management judgment as the valuation inputs are readily observable in the market for other derivatives however valuation inputs are not as readily observable in the market and significant management judgment may be required 

all derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria our derivative exposures are with counterparties with longterm investment grade credit ratings we estimate the fair value of our derivative contracts using an income approach based on valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted amount estimates of the fair value of foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are determined using exchange traded prices and rates we also consider the risk of nonperformance in the estimation of fair value and include an adjustment for nonperformance risk in the measure of fair value of derivative instruments the nonperformance risk adjustment reflects the full credit default spread “cds” applied to the net commodity and foreign currency exposures by counterparty when we are in a net derivative asset position the counterparty cds rates are applied to the net derivative asset position when we are in a net derivative liability position estimates of peer companies’ cds rates are applied to the net derivative liability position 

in certain instances where market data is not available we use management judgment to develop assumptions that are used to determine fair value this could include situations of market illiquidity for a particular currency or commodity or where observable market data may be limited in those situations we generally survey investment banks andor brokers and utilize the surveyed prices and rates in estimating fair value 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we were in a net derivative liability position of 65 million and asset position of 76 million respectively and there were no adjustments recorded for nonperformance risk based on the application of peer companies’ cds rates and because delphi’s exposures were to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings refer to note 17 fair value of financial instruments derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information 

sharebased compensation 

we expense the estimated fair value of the value creation plan as defined and further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein a longterm incentive plan for key employees estimating the fair value for sharebased payments requires us to make assumptions regarding the nature of the payout of the award as well as changes in our stock price during the postinitial public offering period any differences in actual results from management’s estimates could result in fair values different from estimated fair values which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition the following highlights the sensitivity to changes in our stock price 

 

 the fair market value of the class e1 interests as defined and further discussed in note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein was estimated based on a contemporaneous valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist utilizing generally accepted valuation approaches under certain conditions with respect to our initial public offering or a change in control as defined in the board of managers 2010 class e1 interest incentive plan any interests that had not yet vested would immediately become vested approximately 8 million was recognized as a charge to compensation expense since the criteria for immediate vesting was met with respect to the completion of our initial public offering on november 22 2011 

  

refer to note 21 sharebased compensation to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations additionally the significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended december 31 2011 are described 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices in order to manage these risks we operate a centralized risk management program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note 2 significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein and further disclosure is provided in note 17 fair value of financial instruments derivatives and hedging activities to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks and related hedge positions positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices for options and instruments with nonlinear returns appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices currently we do not have any options or instruments with nonlinear returns 

we have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate historically we have reduced our exposure through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions we also face an inherent business risk of exposure to commodity prices risks and have historically offset our exposure particularly to changes in the price of various nonferrous metals used in our manufacturing operations through fixed price purchase agreements commodity swaps and option contracts we continue to manage our exposures to changes in currency rates and commodity prices using these derivative instruments 

currency exchange rate risk 

currency exposures may impact future earnings andor operating cash flows in some instances we choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures currently our most significant currency exposures relate to the mexican peso euro chinese yuan renminbi turkish lira romanian new leu brazilian real and great britain pound as of december 31 2011 the net fair value asset of all financial instruments including hedges and underlying transactions with exposure to currency risk was approximately 844 million and the net fair value asset at december 31 2010 was 794 million the potential loss or gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10 adverse or favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately 148 million and 137 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the impact of a 10 change in rates on fair value differs from a 10 change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates however currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

commodity price risk 

commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various nonferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximately 27 million and an asset of approximately 48 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively if the price of the commodities that are being hedged by our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts changed adversely or favorably by 10 the fair value of our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts would decrease or increase by 26 million and 24 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the changes in the net fair value liability differ from 10 of those balances due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swapsaverage rate forward contracts these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

  

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 1 billion of floating rate debt principally related to the credit agreement the credit agreement carries an interest rate at our option of either a the abr plus i with respect to the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan 150 per annum or ii with respect to the tranche b term loan 150 per annum or b libor plus i with respect to the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan 250 per annum or ii with respect to the tranche b term loan 250 per annum the tranche b term loan includes a libor floor of 100 the interest rate period with respect to the libor interest rate option can be set at one two three or sixmonths as selected by us in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders but payable no less than quarterly we may elect to change the selected interest rate over the term of the credit facilities in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement the applicable interest rates listed above for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a term loan may increase or decrease from time to time by 025 based on changes to our corporate credit ratings accordingly the interest rate will fluctuate during the term of the credit agreement based on changes in the alternate base rate libor or future changes in our corporate credit ratings 

the table below indicates interest rate sensitivity on interest expense to floating rate debt based on amounts outstanding as of december 31 2011
