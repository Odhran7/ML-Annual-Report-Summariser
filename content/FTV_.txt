the following discussion includes information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including electronic components steel plastics and other petroleumbased products aluminum and copper prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world tariffs affect our costs for impacted materials or components we import into the united states based on allocation of annual spend among our various suppliers no single supplier is material however some components that require particular specifications or qualifications are dependent on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources while the covid19 pandemic and the widespread supply chain challenges due to labor raw material and component shortages as well as widespread logistics issues had affected multiple industries and raised material and shipping costs our supply chain was responsive to these dynamics and we implemented solutions including through fbs to effectively support our nearterm operations and help countermeasure production material shortages and distribution limitations for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and hold licenses to use intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to fortive 

competition 

we believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities as well as wellestablished regional competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets we face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed applications expertise distribution channel access service and support technology and innovation breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve for example sales of capital equipment and sterilization consumables are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to oems are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality

a key focus of our human capital management strategy is creating exceptional employee experiences through active listening and communication throughout the organization our senior leaders are committed to actively searching out and listening to our employees and other stakeholders to build our culture as part of this effort we have continued to conduct our annual employee experience survey but also beginning in 2021 we moved to a shorter feedback loop introducing quarterly pulse surveys this cadence has enabled us to be more responsive to feedback while enhancing our ability to understand trends over time with over 80 of our team participating throughout 2021 our overall employee engagement score averaged 77 and our inclusion and belonging score averaged 81 as in prior years the 2021 results informed both management and the board of directors on appropriate actions to continuously enhance our employees’ experience 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2021 was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and governmentowned entities for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical device regulations 

many of our products in the advanced healthcare solutions segment are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders including but not limited to the us food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance and payment of an fda user fee 

table of conten t s 

market access sales and marketing of medical devices in nonus countries are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country for example in the european economic area “eea” a medical device must meet the medical devices directive’s “mdd” essential requirements or for new devices placed on the market after may 26 2021 the medical devices regulation’s “mdr” general safety and performance requirements as well as other requirements set out in the mddmdr depending on the device’s risk class before placing a medical device on the eea market the manufacturer must prepare a declaration of conformity certifying that the device complies with the mddmdr and must then affix the ce mark the notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of the relevant device before issuing a ce certificate following the issuance of this ce certificate manufacturers may prepare the declaration of conformity and affix the ce mark to the devices covered by this ce certificate similar requirements apply in the uk for access to the uk market manufacturers must obtain a ukca certificate and affix a ukca mark to their medical devices however the eea’s ce mark will be accepted in the uk until july 1 2023 

any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and certain other comparable foreign authorities as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda and other comparable foreign authorities as well as audits by our notified body we are required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices requirements as set forth in the quality systems regulation as well as other applicable standards which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process 

we must also comply with global postmarket surveillance regulations including adverse event reporting requirements which require that we review and report to the fda and other comparable foreign authorities any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and other comparable foreign authorities and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission and other comparable foreign regulators medical devices approved or cleared by the fda foreign regulators or our notified body may not be promoted for undocumented unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda other us agencies and other comparable foreign authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

other healthcare laws 

we are subject to various healthcare related laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information in particular the us federal antikickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing remuneration including any kickback or bribe directly or indirectly in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as medicare or medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” prohibits knowingly and willfully 1 executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payors or 2 falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services in addition hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information similar to the us federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under hipaa or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries 

the false claims act imposes liability on any person or entity that among other things knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program knowingly makes uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the us federal government the qui tam provisions of the false claims act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery in addition the government may assert that a claim 

table of conten t s 

including items and services resulting from a violation of the us federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries 

federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers analogous us state laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws also may apply to our business practices including but not limited to research distribution sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including private insurers further there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the us federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa similar laws and regulations apply in many nonus countries 

antibribery and anticorruption laws 

given the international scope of operation we are subject to various us and nonus laws outlawing bribes kickbacks payoffs and other improper payments in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other similar laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies their officers and employees and their intermediaries from making improper payments to public officials to influence those officials or secure an improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business in the past several years there has been a substantial increase in the enforcement of these global antibribery and anticorruption laws our operations throughout the world including in developing countries with heightened risks of corruption and interactions with individuals who are considered public officials under these laws such as healthcare professionals in countries with staterun healthcare systems expose us to the risk of violating these laws violations of these laws or even allegations of violations of these laws could pose reputational risks subject us to investigations and related litigation cause disruptions to our business and result in monetary fines and damages and other sanctions 

data privacy and security laws 

as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business 

data privacy and security laws are rapidly evolving in particular a broad privacy law in california the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” came into effect in january 2020 the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr discussed below and has already prompted several other states to consider similar legislation the ccpa has already been amended several times including through a november 2020 ballot initiative called the california privacy rights act “cpra” which will go into effect in january 2023 

across the european union the general data protection regulation “gdpr” imposes strict requirements in how we collect transmit process and retain personal data including among other things in certain circumstances a requirement for prompt notification of data breaches to supervisory authorities andor to data subjects with the risk of significant fines for noncompliance additionally after a july 2020 decision from the court of justice of the european union european regulators are requiring additional safeguards to facilitate the transfer of personal information from the european union to the united states and other certain jurisdictions 

several other countries such as china russia and brazil have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that meaningfully expand the compliance requirements around confidential personal andor sensitive data that we may have access to or process in the course of our business in china and russia privacy and security laws may require a copy of personal data relating to citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions brazil’s lei geral de proteção de dados “lgpd” increases compliance requirements related to privacy data protection and information security for businesses that are located or do business within brazil although the lgpd shares similarities with the gdpr it also contains a number of unique features including specific legal bases not found in the gdpr that allow an organization to process personal data and requirements for the role of a data protection officer in these countries and elsewhere the laws applicable to data privacy and security may require changes to business practices or additional investment for compliance purposes

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws such as 

• the international traffic in arms regulations administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls which among other things impose license requirements on the export from the united states of defense articles and defense services listed on the united states munitions list 

• the export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security which among other things impose licensing requirements on the export incountry transfer and reexport of certain dualuse goods technology and software which are items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications

• the import regulations administered by us customs and border protection 

other nations’ governments have implemented similar exportimport control and economic sanction regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available in markets worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors

risk related to our business operations 

the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our global operations and the operations of our customers suppliers and vendors is continuing to have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our global operations expose us broadly to the covid19 pandemic in particular continued efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus including new variants of the virus have caused us our suppliers and customers to alter commercial activities and utilization of facilities and manufacturing sites adversely impacting our ability to manufacture sell transport and service our products in addition implementation of measures to help control the spread of the virus including vaccine mandates remote work policies travel restrictions and social distancing measures have negatively impacted our collaboration efforts with our global colleagues customers vendors and service providers and increased the risk and cost of workforce retention protecting against cyber attacks and adequately sourcing raw materials components and transportation for our products while we continue to implement global and local response teams supply chain management and business continuity efforts internally and with our customers suppliers and vendors the duration and extent of the operational and financial impact of the covid19 pandemic remains highly uncertain 

the degree to which covid19 continues to impact us going forward will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and therefore cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic new variants its severity or the actions taken to contain the spread and impact of covid19 the broad acceptance effectiveness and distribution of vaccines the overall vaccination rate in the relevant jurisdictions continued impact on supply chain and transportation and how quickly and to what extent normal economic market and operating conditions resume even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided as a public health matter we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy supply chain disruptions inflation inperson collaboration efforts workforce dynamic and consumer confidence 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity supply chain management or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions customer demand and supply chain or transportation disruptions our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases and supply chain management to reflect any supply chain or transportation disruptions or changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by the covid19 pandemic increases in demand outpacing supply capabilities labor shortages seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn or general supply chain disruptions suppliers have extended lead times limited supplies or increased prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet demand for our products we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities 

conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability contractual obligations or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating quality or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes including as a result of contractual disputes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints operational or quality issues bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes among others any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

table of conten t s 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities or components that we use in our operations 

as discussed in the section entitled “businessmaterials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past in particular the covid19 pandemic and the widespread supply chain challenges due to labor raw material and component shortages as well as widespread logistics issues affected multiple industries raised material and shipping costs limited the quantities available and extended the lead time required for supplies and deliveries any sustained interruption in the supply of these items including as a result of general supply chain constraints increasing demand outpacing supplies or contractual disputes with suppliers or vendors could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity or component prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity or component costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt changes in global trade policies volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment and underemployment inflation reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures political and social instability war sanctions natural disasters terrorist attacks and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect us and our distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

• reducing demand for our products software and services limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies 

• increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increasing price competition in our served markets 

• supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products 

• increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets and 

• increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which in addition to increasing the risks identified above could result in preference actions against us 

in addition adverse general economic conditions may lead to instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us or our lenders are unable to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations we may not be able to make certain investments or acquisitions or fully execute our business plans and strategies furthermore our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets if there is instability in global capital and credit markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our 

table of conten t s 

businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets and product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

many of our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see the section entitled “businesscompetition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new or enhanced products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• accurately identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

• allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization 

• innovate and develop new technologies and applications and acquire or obtain rights to thirdparty technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets 

• obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner price them competitively and costeffectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time and 

• stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees our business may be harmed 

much of our future success and our ability to realize the benefit of our acquisitions and execute our portfolio strategy depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including our senior management in particular the markets for highly skilled employees and leaders in the technology and healthcare industries are extremely competitive furthermore the workforce shortage in the united states during the covid19 pandemic has increased the overall competitiveness and cost of 

retaining and attracting qualified employees our brand our culture our ability to provide competitive compensation our locations of operations and our reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain key employees in these competitive markets and during periods of workforce shortages if we are not competitive or successful in our recruiting efforts if we cannot attract or retain key employees or if we do not adequately ensure effective succession planning or transfer of knowledge for our key employees our ability to deliver and execute on our operational development or portfolio strategies would be adversely affected 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties and some of which are managed on a decentralized independent basis by our operating companies to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our profitability 

our restructuring activities could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation

experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements

risk related to our international operations 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2021 approximately 49 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets such as eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia our international business including our business in highgrowth markets outside the united states is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations as well as increased risks due to significant uncertainties related to political and economic changes including 

• interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers 

• differences in terms of sale including payment terms 

• local product preferences and product requirements 

• changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including changes in relationship with the united states particularly with respect to china 

• trade protection measures increased trade barriers imposition of significant tariffs on imports or exports embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements 

• new conditions to and possible restrictions of existing free trade agreements 

• epidemics such as the coronavirus outbreak that adversely impact travel production or demand 

• unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements including negative changes in tax laws in the us and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products 

• the impact of the uk’s exit from the eu brexit on the company’s business operations in the uk and europe including the effects of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union the european atomic energy community and the united kingdom signed on december 30 2020 

• limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis and 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

trade relations between china and the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

we have experienced growth in various end markets in china during 2021 sales in china accounted for approximately 12 of our total sales for the year in addition we have numerous facilities in china many of which serve multiple fortive operating companies in manufacturing distribution product design and selling general and administrative functions 

there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and china including with respect to trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs in particular there continues to be uncertainty about us foreign trade policy with respect to china including any changes to the trade policies that may be adopted by the biden administration any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade especially trade with china could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation 

table of conten t s 

effects in addition certain of our businesses transact in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the transaction currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable exchange rate effects we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

risk related to our acquisitions investments and dispositions 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our anticipated rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our anticipated rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates anticipated which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price acquisitions that align with our portfolio strategy may be difficult to identify and execute for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

• any acquired business technology service or product could underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable 

• we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions or strategic relationships 

• acquisitions or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period or over the longterm 

• preclosing and postclosing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from period to period 

• acquisitions or strategic relationships could create demands on our management operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address 

• we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers 

• we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition or strategic relationship 

• we may assume by acquisition or strategic relationship unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

• in connection with acquisitions we may enter into postclosing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments earnout obligations and indemnification obligations which may have unpredictable financial results 

• in connection with acquisitions we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets and 

• we may have interests that diverge from those of strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate exposing us to additional risk 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the 

table of conten t s 

liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face 

unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example in 2018 we splitoff most of our automation and specialty platform in a reverse morris trust transaction with altra industrial motion corp and in 2020 we spunoff our former industrial technologies segment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

potential indemnification liabilities to vontier pursuant to the separation agreement could materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with vontier to govern the separation and distribution of vontier and the relationship between the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify vontier under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which vontier has agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against vontier will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that vontier will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations each of these risks could negatively affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risk related to regulatory and compliance matters 

changes in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment and electronic communications and market standardizations we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations and standards these regulations and standards are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change or delay in implementation in any of these regulations or standards or in the interpretation application or enforcement thereof could reduce or delay demand for our products and services increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations or implementation of industry standards on the timeline we expect in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or industry standards or the adoption of new regulations or industry standards which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines or industry standard implementation timelines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to 

table of conten t s 

some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations in addition some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous or energetic materials in the development manufacturing or servicing of our products we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements moreover any accident that results in significant personal injury or property damage whether occurring during development manufacturing servicing use or storage of our products may result in significant production interruption delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damage harm to our reputation and reduction in morale among our employees any of which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

• we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory 

• we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder which could result in loss of the contract we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts 

• we are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in multiple jurisdictions that regulate the collection use protection and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in particular the general data protection regulation became effective in 

table of conten t s 

the european union in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act became effective in january 2020 we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties that or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position 

• certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the us fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by certain accrediting bodies to varying degrees these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products and 

• we are also required to comply with ever changing labor and employment laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions these changes could negatively impact our business or financial position

for additional information regarding these risks please refer to the section entitled “businessregulatory matters” 

risk related to our tax and accounting matters 

changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions as such changes to applicable tax laws or policies including interpretations or retroactive applications thereof could result in a material change in our tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate furthermore certain tax laws are inherently ambiguous requiring subjective interpretation on the application thereof our interpretation and the corresponding amount of income taxes we pay is and may in the future continue to be subject to audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

foreign remittance taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change or we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that had previously been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards then our income tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate could increase 

in addition changes by the us in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our income tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate comprehensive tax reform was enacted through the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tcja” which includes numerous provisions that impact us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits the taxing authorities continue to issue regulations and guidance some with retrospective application to the provisions of the tcja and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future any future adjustments resulting from retrospective regulations and guidance issued will be considered a discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period guidance is issued for example the tcja eliminated the deduction of certain domestic and foreign research and development expenditures beginning on january 1 2022 and requires capitalization and amortization of such expenditures over a specified a period any revision regulation or new guidance to this rule may impact our future income tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate 

furthermore changes in multilateral agreements and the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” 

table of conten t s 

and could significantly increase our tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes and many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes to align with new oecd policies for example in october 2021 oecd announced an agreed framework for an expansion of the taxing rights of market countries and to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate in december 2021 oecd published detailed model rules for a global minimum corporate tax rate of fifteen percent which will require multilateral agreements andor countryspecific legislative action to be effective a global minimum corporate tax rate and any other implemented changes could significantly increase tax uncertainty due to differing interpretations and increased audit scrutiny 

we could incur significant liability if any of our separation from danaher our separation of our automation and specialty business or our separation of vontier collectively the “separation transactions” is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the separation transactions qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from the applicable parties regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the applicable opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that any of the separation transactions is taxable if it determines that any of the corresponding facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in any of the applicable opinions if any of the separation transactions is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we as well as our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax would incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

changes in us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance any new or amended standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2021 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 130 billion in accordance with gaap we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized refer to note 2 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill and acquired intangibles 

risk related to our financing activities 

we have incurred a significant amount of debt and our debt will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 40 billion of longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt on a consolidated basis we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions 

table of conten t s 

• exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates and 

• resulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our debt or fail to comply with the financial or restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our credit agreement include a debttoebitda ratio please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

risk related to shareholder rights 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation “restated certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws “amended and restated bylaws” contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors the “board” rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by the board these provisions include among others 

• the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent 

• rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings 

• the right of the board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 

• the ability of our directors and not shareholders to fill vacancies including those resulting from an enlargement of the board on the board and 

• the requirement that the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 80 of our voting stock is required to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 

in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an “interested stockholder” shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board and by providing the board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board

determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with our company or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against our company and our directors and officers this exclusive forum provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the securities act the exchange act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction

overview 

general 

fortive is a multinational business with global operations with approximately 49 of our sales derived from customers outside the united states in 2021 as a company with global operations our businesses are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors our geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of products software and services we offer typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country except for the united states on our operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including their sales to the extent possible to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of opportunities and challenges including technological development in most of the markets we serve the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we define highgrowth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia with the exception of japan and australia we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality attract relevant talent and retain grow and empower our talented workforce and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refer to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 1 the impact from acquired businesses and 2 the impact of currency translation references to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition and the effect of purchase accounting adjustments of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture the portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales impact from acquired businesses and b the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales impact from acquired businesses after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of acquisition and divestiture related items because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers we exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of longterm performance references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales 

business performance and outlook 

business performance 

overall demand for our products and services accelerated during 2021 with aggregate yearoveryear sales increasing by 134 the increase was largely driven by demand from our existing businesses which increased by 95 on broadbased momentum and focused execution across our portfolio most notably within our shortcycle industrial and software as a service “saas” businesses 

geographically yearoveryear sales from existing businesses in developed markets increased at a high single digit rate driven by high single digit increases in north america and western europe yearoveryear sales from existing businesses in high 

table of conten t s 

growth markets increased at a midteens rate driven by midtwenties increases in latin america and midteens increases in china 

in addition to increased demand yearoveryear price increases contributed 18 to sales growth during 2021 as compared to 2020 and is reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

during 2021 widespread supply chain challenges emerged due to labor raw material and component shortages as well as logistics issues across multiple industries resulting in increased material and shipping costs we worked to mitigate the impact of the supply chain challenges by implementing solutions to support nearterm operations executing on countermeasures for material shortages and managing production all of which contributed to yearoveryear revenue growth and margin expansion in 2021 however due to the magnitude of the supply chain and logistics issues impacting the economy broadly and those related to electronic components in particular demand for our products outpaced our ability to supply and our backlog grew in the second half of 2021  

covid19 continues to have an impact on our business and results in 2020 we experienced significant declines in demand as a result of broad disruption in the global economy in 2021 we experienced a rebound of demand but also encountered operating challenges related to logistics material availability and higher levels of absenteeism we expect that the pandemic and its impact on global commerce will remain uncertain and we will continue to deploy fbs to countermeasure the challenges we encounter 

2022 outlook 

we anticipate the strong demand for our products and services will continue into 2022 with yearoveryear revenue expected to increase between 90 and 120 for the full year including growth from existing businesses of between 55 and 85 on anticipated strong demand in key end markets and continued deployment of fbs to drive share gains and innovation this outlook is subject to various assumptions and risks including but not limited to the magnitude of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions continued strength of key end markets elective surgery rates the availability of electronic components our ability to convert backlog sustain our workforce levels and maintain manufacturing capacity 

we anticipate that supply chain and inflationary pressures will persist throughout 2022 and that although our backlog may decline compared to 2021 it may remain elevated compared to historical levels we will continue to deploy fbs to actively manage production challenges collaborate with customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and utilize price increases and other countermeasures to offset inflationary pressures we are monitoring the risks of new covid19 variants which may be more contagious or severe or less responsive to treatment and vaccines and may impact the rate that virus control measures ease or become more restrictive which could impact our future results 

we are monitoring matters of international trade monetary and fiscal policies relations between the us and china as well as evaluating the impacts of proposed legislation and various investment and taxation policy initiatives being debated in the united states and by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” as of the filing date of this report we are however unable to quantify the anticipated impact of these matters on our financial results

2020 compared to 2019 

yearoveryear sales of products and services from existing businesses of precision technologies declined 77 during 2020 the yearoveryear decline in demand was largely driven by the impacts of covid19 in both direct and adjacent end markets specifically for test and measurement instruments declines in demand for sensors in the industrial end market and a decline in shipments of our energetic materials which was partially offset by increased demand in the medical end market for ventilator components and for critical environments supporting covid19 patient treatment efforts we have realized sequential improvement in demand from the low point in the second quarter of 2020 and returned to sales growth from existing businesses in the fourth quarter of 2020

cost of sales and gross profit 

the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2021 as compared to 2020 is due primarily to higher yearoveryear sales volumes from existing businesses incremental costs from our recently acquired businesses increasing material freight and logistics costs and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates all of which were partially offset by lower operating costs and gains from productivity improvement initiatives

operating expenses 

sga expenses increased during 2021 as compared to 2020 due to higher intangible amortization and incremental expenses from our recent acquisitions higher employee compensation costs and sga expenses at our existing businesses due to broad cost reduction efforts executed in 2020 to better align with reductions in demand and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates all of which was partially offset by reductions in net acquisitionrelated costs and incremental savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives  on a yearoveryear basis sga expenses declined by 270 basis points as a percentage of revenue when compared to 2020 reflecting that demand for our products and services grew at a faster rate than expenses 

sga expenses increased during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to higher intangible amortization and incremental expenses from our recently acquired businesses that were mostly offset by broad cost reduction efforts that reduced labor expenses to better align with reductions in demand during the second and third quarter of 2020 primarily through the use of furloughs and reductions in salaried compensation costs as well as other reductions in discretionary spending to a lesser

interest costs 

for a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness refer to note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net of 103 million was recorded during 2021 compared to 149 million during 2020 and 143 million during 2019 yearoveryear interest expense decreased in 2021 and increased in 2020 due to changes in yearoveryear average debt balances in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities andor access the capital markets if we enter into such additional financing transactions the amount of annual interest expense will increase 

unrealized gain on investment in vontier corporation 

on october 9 2020 we completed the vontier separation and retained 199 of the shares of vontier common stock immediately following the separation we did not retain a controlling interest in vontier and therefore the subsequent fair value changes of the retained vontier shares are included in our results from continuing operations at december 31 2020 the retained vontier shares were remeasured at fair value based on vontier’s closing stock price with unrealized gains of 11 billion recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings 

on january 19 2021 we completed an exchange of all of the retained vontier shares as part of a noncash debtforequity exchange that reduced outstanding indebtedness of fortive by 11 billion 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements we record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

our effective tax rate can be affected by among others changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments the company is subject to examination in the united states various states and foreign jurisdiction for the tax years 2010 to 2021 these examinations include filings of tax returns prior to our separation from danaher tax returns of enterprises no longer in our portfolio and tax returns for preacquisition periods of enterprises added to our portfolio significant obligations are detailed in our tax matters agreements in connection with the separation of fortive from danaher on july 1 2016 the splitoff of the automation and specialty business on october 1 2018 and the vontier separation on october 9 2020 we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary 

we conduct business globally and as part of our global business we file numerous income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions our ability to obtain a tax benefit in certain countries that continue to have lower statutory tax 

table of conten t s 

rates than the united states is dependent on our levels of taxable income in such foreign countries we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not typically have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income 

changes by the us in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our income tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate comprehensive tax reform was enacted under the tcja which includes numerous provisions that affect businesses and introduces changes that impact us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits the taxing authorities continue to issue regulations and guidance some with retrospective application to the provisions of the tcja and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future any future adjustments resulting from retrospective regulations and guidance issued will be considered as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the interim period the guidance is issued 

furthermore changes in multilateral agreements and the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the oecd and could significantly increase our tax provision cash taxes paid and effective tax rate the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes and many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes to align with new oecd policies the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of oecd policy changes

comparison of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 was 93 37 and 204 respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2021 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and a permanent difference on the realized gain on our retained vontier shares due to the taxfree treatment of our disposition of the shares through the debtforequity exchange that was completed on january 19 2021 the debtforequity exchange included an exchange of all of our vontier common stock owned as of december 31 2020 

our effective tax rate for 2020 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate offset by tax costs associated with repatriating a portion of our previously reinvested earnings outside of the united states and a permanent difference on the unrealized gain on our retained vontier shares due to the taxfree treatment of our disposition of the shares through the debtforequity exchange that was completed on january 19 2021 the debtforequity exchange included an exchange of all of our vontier common stock owned as of december 31 2020 

our effective tax rate for 2019 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law and earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased by 11 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to a decrease in net earnings of 10 billion including both continuing and discontinued operations unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 132 million and favorable changes in pension benefit adjustments of 38 million the decrease in net earnings was due to the recognition of a 11 billion unrealized gain on the retained vontier shares in 2020 

comprehensive income increased by 895 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to an increase in net earnings of 874 million including both continuing and discontinued operations favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 13 million and favorable changes in pension benefit adjustments of 8 million the increase in net earnings from 2019 to 2020 was due to the recognition of a 11 billion unrealized gain on the retained vontier shares 

financial instruments and risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk and commodity prices each of which could impact our financial statements we generally address our exposure to these risks through our 

table of conten t s 

normal operating and financing activities in addition our broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

we manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2021 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 134 million 

as of december 31 2021 our variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar commercial paper and term loans refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2021 as a result our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature we anticipate issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations andor term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings the annual effective rate associated with our outstanding us dollar denominated commercial paper and delayeddraw term loan was approximately 032 and 070 respectively and we recorded interest expense of 04 million on these variablerate obligations on an annualized basis a hypothetical 10 basis points increase in market interest rates as of december 31 2021 on our variablerate debt obligations as of december 31 2021 would have increased our interest expense by 137 million in 2021 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary we also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2021 would have resulted in a reduction of foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity of approximately 198 million 

currency exchange rates favorably impacted 2021 reported sales by 15 as compared to 2020 as the us dollar was on average weaker against most major currencies during 2021 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2020 if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2021 were to prevail throughout 2022 currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2022 estimated sales by approximately 10 relative to our performance in 2021 in general additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact our sales and results of operations 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and highlyliquid investment grade cash equivalents and receivables from customers we place cash and cash equivalents with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents we emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity which consist of access to term loans commercial paper and our revolving credit facility in addition to shortterm liquidity benefits provided by cash repatriation will be sufficient to allow us to continue funding and investing in our existing businesses consummate strategic acquisitions make interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness fulfill our contractual obligations and manage our capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

on march 27 2020 the us federal government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the covid19 outbreak which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions and shortterm liquidity assistance measures during 2020 we deferred remittance of approximately 35 million in payroll tax payments with half subsequently remitted in december of 2021 and the remainder to be remitted in december of 2022  

while covid19 has created volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets we have not realized a significant impact on our financial position liquidity or ability to meet our debt covenants as of the filing date of this report however we continue to monitor the capital markets and general global economic conditions the financial markets worldwide including the united states have been impacted by covid19 and this volatility and disruption during the first half of 2020 impacted broad access to the capital markets and pricing on new indebtedness our credit facilities including our revolving credit facility are predominately with institutions that we believe to date have been relatively unaffected by the disruption due to the volatility and disruption in the commercial paper markets during the first six months of 2020 we temporarily reduced our reliance on this source of funding and consequently paid down and refinanced our outstanding commercial paper with the term loan that was initially due march 2021 and was retired in the debtforequity exchange in august 2021 we resumed borrowing under our commercial paper program to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 

2021 financing and capital transactions

on february 9 2021 we repurchased 281 million of the 0875 convertible senior notes due 2022 the “convertible notes” using the remaining cash proceeds received from vontier in the separation and other cash on hand in connection with the repurchase we recorded a loss on extinguishment of 1049 million in the first quarter of 2021 

on july 1 2021 all outstanding shares of our 50 mandatory convertible preferred stock “mcps” converted at a rate of 140978 common shares per share of preferred stock into an aggregate of approximately 194 million shares net of fractional shares of the company’s common stock pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation governing the series a preferred stock fortive issued cash in lieu of fractional shares of common stock in the conversion these payments were recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital the final dividend of 1250 per share or 172 million in the aggregate was paid on july 1 2021 the impact of the mcps calculated under the ifconverted method was antidilutive for the periods in 2021 prior to conversion

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity 

operating activities 

operating cash flows from continuing operations can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

table of conten t s 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 993 million in 2021 an increase of 15 million or approximately 2 as compared to 2020 this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors 

• 2021 operating cash flows were impacted by lower net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2020 which were driven by a yearoveryear increase in operating profits of 273 million a decrease in interest expense of 45 million associated with the net repayment of debt a gain on the retained vontier shares of 57 million and a gain on litigation resolution of 30 million which were partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt of 105 million the gain on the retained vontier shares and litigation dismissal and substantially all of the loss on the extinguishment of debt are noncash items that impact net earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows 

• the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable used 64 million of cash during 2021 compared to providing 93 million of cash during 2020 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle which generally represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period during 2021 we experienced an increase in inventory due in part to higher safety stock levels which were increased to buffer the impact of supply chain and logistics challenges and to fulfill customer demand 

• the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities used 6 million of cash in 2021 as compared to providing 208 million in 2020 with yearoveryear change largely driven by the funding of a 28 million deferred compensation liability which was associated with the servicechannel acquisition and was paid into escrow upon closing of the transaction as well as other routine changes in various compensation and benefit payments 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 978 million in 2020 an increase of 276 million or approximately 39 as compared to 2019 this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors 

• 2020 operating cash flows were impacted by higher net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2019 which were driven by a yearoveryear increase in operating profits of 96 million and a yearoveryear increase in interest expense of 6 million primarily associated with our financing activities the yearoveryear increase in operating profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of 43 million largely attributable to our recently acquired businesses further the yearoveryear increase in net earnings for 2020 was impacted by the recognition of a 11 billion unrealized gain on the retained vontier shares depreciation amortization and the unrealized gain are noncash expenses that impact earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows 

• the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable provided 93 million of operating cash flows during 2020 compared to using 59 million of cash during 2019 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period 

• the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided 208 million of cash in 2020 as compared to providing 148 million in 2019 the year over year change was largely driven by the timing of tax payments and various employee benefit accruals 

investing activities 

investing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was approximately 26 billion during 2021 compared to approximately 01 billion and 40 billion of net cash used in 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in investing cash flows was driven by the acquisitions of servicechannel and provation which totaled approximately 26 billion partially offset by a yearoveryear decrease in capital expenditures of 26 million the reduction in capital expenditures was largely due to higher spending in the comparable period in 2020 which was related to the integration of the asp business for a discussion of our acquisitions refer to “—overview” 

capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting product development initiatives improving information technology systems and purchasing equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers capital expenditures totaled 50 million in 2021 76 million in 2020 and 75 million in 2019 we expect capital 

table of conten t s 

spending to be between approximately 80 million and 100 million in 2022 though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

financing activities and indebtedness 

financing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance of equity the issuance and repayments of debt and commercial paper payments of quarterly cash dividends to common and preferred shareholders and cash consideration received from the vontier separation financing activities from continuing operations generated cash of 652 million in 2021 compared to using 676 million and generating 28 billion of cash in 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2021 we repaid the remaining 317 million outstanding on the delayeddraw term loan due 2020 repurchased 281 million of the 0875 convertible senior notes due 2022 and resumed borrowing under our commercial paper programs with proceeds being used for acquisitions and general corporate purposes during the year ended december 31 2021 we paid 132 million of cash dividends to common shareholders and holders of our mcps 

refer to “—liquidity and capital resources” section above for a description of our financing activities in 2021 2020 and 2019 

we generally expect to satisfy any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through term loans or issuances of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs with credit support provided by the revolving credit facility 

the carrying value of total debt outstanding as of december 31 2021 was approximately 40 billion we had 20 billion available under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness 

the availability of the revolving credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the commercial paper programs when we have outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2021 we had 04 million borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program we expect to limit any future borrowings under the revolving credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow if needed to repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

in 2020 we repaid 11 billion related to the issuance of commercial paper under the commercial paper program received proceeds from borrowings of 742 million repaid 17 billion of borrowings and paid 163 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

subsequent event 

on february 17 2022 the companys board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 20 million shares of the companys outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions there is no expiration date for the repurchase program and the timing and amount of repurchases under the program are determined by the companys management based on market conditions and other factors the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time by the board of directors 

dividends 

on november 4 2021 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007 per common share paid on december 30 2021 to holders of record on november 26 2021 

aggregate cash payments for both common and mcps dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended december 31 2021 were 132 million and were recorded as dividends to shareholders in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows 

on january 25 2022 we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share payable on march 25 2022 to common stockholders of record on february 25 2022 

cash and cash requirements 

cash 

as of december 31 2021 we held approximately 8193 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investmentgrade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less the annual effective rate was immaterial approximately 18 of our cash at december 31 2021 was held in the us 

table of conten t s 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund our pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs or objectives with respect to our cash requirements we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs we also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

we have made an assertion regarding the amount of current earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs local law restrictions high foreign remittance costs previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions or future growth needs for most of our foreign operations we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment the amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings 

cash requirements 

the following table sets forth a summary of our shortterm and longterm cash requirements as of december 31 2021 under 1 longterm debt principal and interest obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain 

in addition to the obligations noted above we have issued guarantees consisting primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure our obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions these guarantees are not recorded on our balance sheet and 37 million in commitments expire within one year of december 31 2021 and 27 million later than one year from december 31 2021 

table of conten t s 

during 2021 we contributed 1 million and 10 million to our us and nonus defined benefit pension plans respectively during 2022  our cash contribution requirements for our us and nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 2 million and 12 million respectively the ultimate amounts we will contribute depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

as of december 31 2021 we expect to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future including our cash needs in the united states 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  we measure our allowance to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset in accordance with asu no 201613 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  we pool assets with similar risk characteristics for this measurement based on attributes that may include asset type duration andor credit risk rating the future expected losses of each pool are estimated based on numerous quantitative and qualitative factors reflecting management’s estimate of collectability over the remaining contractual life of the pooled assets including 

• duration 

• historical current and forecasted future loss experience by asset type 

• historical current and forecasted delinquency and writeoff trends 

• historical current and forecasted economic conditions and 

• historical current and forecasted credit risk 

we regularly perform detailed reviews of our trade accounts and unbilled receivable portfolios to determine if changes in the aforementioned qualitative and quantitative factors have impacted the adequacy of the allowances 

volatility and uncertainty in overall global economic conditions and worldwide capital markets as a result of the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay and as a result may increase the difficulty in collecting trade accounts and unbilled receivables we did not realize notable increases in loss rates and delinquencies during the year ended december 31 2021 and given the nature of our portfolio of receivables our historical experience during times of challenging economic conditions and our forecasted future impact of covid19 on our customer’s ability to pay we did not record material provisions for credit losses as a result of the covid19 pandemic during the year ended december 31 2021 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our current estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we would be required to writeoff additional receivable balances which would adversely impact our net earnings and financial condition in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the calculation of our allowance we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in anticipated collectability noting that our allowance would increase by 4 million with a corresponding charge to sga 

expected credit losses of the assets originated during the year ended december 31 2021 as well as changes to expected losses during the same periods are recognized in earnings for the year ended december 31 2021 

table of conten t s 

inventories  we record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the net realizable value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory which would adversely impact our financial statements in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the calculation of the net realizable value of our inventory we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the anticipated realization noting that our inventory would decrease by 7 million with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding our inventory balances as of december 31 2021 

acquired intangibles and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur refer to notes 2 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing our goodwill impairment testing we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach we estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

in 2021 we had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in continuing operations reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment we believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth as of the date of the 2021 annual impairment test the carrying value of goodwill in each reporting unit ranged from 1713 million to 33 billion our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2021 indicated that in all instances the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge 

the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 115 to approximately 785 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 90 to approximately 705 we evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of the reporting units including as applicable results of the estimated fair value using an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and concluded no impairment charges were required 

we review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of 

table of conten t s 

negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves we established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we derive revenue from the sale of products and services revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services in determining if control has transferred we consider whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present such as the transfer of title present right to payment significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality to determine the consideration that the customer owes us we make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates consisting primarily of volume discounts and other shortterm incentive programs refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 

if our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected historically our estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

stockbased compensation  for a description of our stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate given our limited trading history following the separation from danaher stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stock options in the postseparation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies expected volatility is based on a weighted average blend of our historical stock price volatility from july 2 2016 the date of the danaher separation through the stock option grant date and the average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies for the expected term of the options the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension and other post employment benefits  for a description of our pension accounting practices refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements certain of our us and nonus employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors our financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans during 2021 would have increased the net obligation by 30 million from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2021 

our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125 to 432 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets during 2021 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense in 2021 would have increased by 1 million 1 million on an aftertax basis 

income taxes  for a description of our income tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with gaap deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on our tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate if we experience cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years we normally conclude that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized 

table of conten t s 

unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if we experience cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years we then consider a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country we would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction we establish a valuation allowance 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if in our assessment it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense 

in addition we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments see “results of operations  income taxes” and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary 

an increase in our 2021 effective tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 of 7 million

the following discussion includes information common to all of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including electronic components steel plastics and other petroleumbased products cast iron aluminum and copper prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world tariffs affect our costs for impacted materials or components we import into the united states no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2020 we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and hold licenses to use intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to fortive 

competition 

we believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities as well as wellestablished regional competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets we face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed applications expertise distribution channel 

access service and support technology and innovation breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve for example capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to oems are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

human capital resources 

empowering our talented global team to contribute in meaningful ways is a critical component of our strategy and our success to support the advancement of our employees and the success of our company we invest in and develop our employees at every level we are committed to creating a challenging and collaborative culture and environment where our employees can grow develop and do their best work 

covid19 response 

in the uncertainty that immediately followed the covid19 pandemic we were guided by five key pillars in our response to our employees safety transparency empathy science and employee trust the policies we implemented were guided with the safety of our employees their families our customers and our communities as the number one priority with our actions informed by data and expert public health guidance the manner in which we considered and communicated our policies and actions were driven by the recognition of and empathy for the uncertainty fear and reallife impact caused by the pandemic for our colleagues with that in mind we focused on being agile and transparent with what we were doing and why we were doing it while listening to ongoing feedback from our global teams and quickly making changes where needed we did our best to accommodate the needs of our people as they managed through an incredibly difficult year personally and professionally 

driven by our values we 

• formed global and local response teams at every level to create hundreds of standard processes to share best practices and streamline communication to keep our employees safe and informed 

• acted quickly to limit and then stop business travel 

• ensured pay continuity for quarantine periods for our employees 

• quickly made the decision to enable and then mandate remote work for those who were able to do so while ensuring that our essential manufacturing team members had the education resources and support needed to stay safe on the job 

• created flexible shifts and schedules to accommodate childcare and other family or personal needs 

• provided subsidized childcare and other caregiver services as well as parental counseling

human capital strategy 

our human capital strategy is designed to attract retain and develop the best talent to drive our business strategy forward by offering a competitive reward structure and a compelling employee value proposition a key element of our value proposition is our commitment to our employees’ continued learning development and success to respond to our growing business and technology changes our leadership development  learning team has adopted a blended learning approach that combines online digital learning with classroom teaching and coaching to effectively scale continuous learning and accelerate our ability to learn quickly and remain agile throughout fortive with the challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic we further enhanced our virtual and online learning and development platform to ensure safety of our employees without compromising our commitment to our employees’ ongoing career success 

the following is a summary of some of the key support we provide to our employees to further their learning and development 



each one of these investments in our team delivers value to both our people and our customers with the investments focused on development that adds most value to stakeholders 

inclusion and diversity 

we believe that creating inclusive places to work and diverse points of view are the lifeblood of innovation and growth and provide us with a strategic advantage in 2020 we continued to make significant strides to reflect the needs priorities and experiences of our global team and strengthen our culture of inclusion and diversity our board of directors and our compensation committee oversee our human capital management strategies including our inclusion and diversity efforts our vp inclusion  diversity works closely with our senior management and our inclusion  diversity council involving employees at every level in establishing a collaborative vision that will truly reflect the needs priorities and viewpoints of our diverse global team 

our inclusion and diversity strategies are founded on the following pillars using the insights from employees community and other stakeholders 



please refer to our proxy statement for more details about our progress against these pillars 

engagement and communication 

a key focus of our human capital management strategy is active listening and effective communication throughout the organization our senior leaders are committed to actively listen to our employees and other stakeholders as demonstrated by over one hundred separate “courageous conversations” held in 2020 to actively listen and learn on race and social justice matters so we can make a real impact with our actions in addition in 2020 we conducted several employee surveys focused on getting feedback on actions related to our covid19 response work we wanted to ensure our teams had the best support possible through such an extremely challenging time this allowed for us to listen learn and adjust quickly to the needs of our teams across the globe based on the learnings from 2020 we have adjusted our approach to employee experience surveys and feedback beginning in 2021 we have moved from an annual survey to shorter quarterly employee experience surveys and a more thorough biennial survey this will enable us to be more responsive to the needs and feedback from the organization while enhancing our ability to understand trends over time the results inform both management and the board of directors on appropriate actions and strategies to continuously enhance our employees’ experience 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2020 was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and governmentowned entities for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

medical device regulations 

many of our products in the advanced healthcare solutions segment are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes circulars and orders including but not limited to the us food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance and payment of an fda user fee 

market access sales and marketing of medical devices in nonus countries are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country for example in the european economic area “eea” a medical device must meet the medical devices directive’s “mdd” essential requirements or effective may 26 2021 the medical devices regulation’s “mdr” general safety and performance requirements before placing a medical device on the eea market the manufacturer must prepare a declaration of conformity certifying that the device complies with the mddmdr and must then affix the ce mark the notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of the relevant device before issuing a ce certificate following the issuance of this ce certificate manufacturers may prepare the declaration of conformity and affix the ce mark to the devices covered by this ce certificate similar requirements apply in the uk for access to the uk market manufacturers must obtain a ukca certificate and affix a ukca mark to their medical devices however the ce mark will be accepted in the uk until july 1 2023 

any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and certain other comparable foreign authorities as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda and other comparable foreign authorities as well as audits by our notified body we are required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices requirements as set forth in the quality systems regulation which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process 

we must also comply with global postmarket surveillance regulations including adverse event reporting requirements which require that we review and report to the fda and other comparable foreign authorities any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and other comparable foreign authorities and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission and other comparable foreign regulators medical devices approved or cleared by the fda foreign regulators or our notified body may not be promoted for undocumented unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda other us agencies and other comparable foreign authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses 

other healthcare laws 

we are subject to various healthcare related laws regulating fraud and abuse research and development pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information in particular the us federal antikickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing remuneration including any kickback or bribe directly or indirectly in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as medicare or medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” prohibits knowingly and willfully 1 executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payors or 2 falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services in addition hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information similar to the us federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under hipaa or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries 

the false claims act imposes liability on any person or entity that among other things knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program knowingly makes uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the us federal government the qui tam provisions of the false claims act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false 

claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery in addition the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the us federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries 

federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers analogous us state laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws also may apply to our business practices including but not limited to research distribution sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including private insurers further there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the us federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa similar laws and regulations apply in many nonus countries 

antibribery and anticorruption laws 

given the international scope of operation we are subject to various us and nonus laws outlawing bribes kickbacks payoffs and other improper payments in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other similar laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies their officers and employees and their intermediaries from making improper payments to public officials to influence those officials or secure an improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business in the past several years there has been a substantial increase in the enforcement of these global antibribery and anticorruption laws our operations throughout the world including in developing countries with heightened risks of corruption and interactions with individuals who are considered public officials under these laws such as healthcare professionals in countries with staterun healthcare systems expose us to the risk of violating these laws violations of these laws or even allegations of violations of these laws could pose reputational risks subject us to investigations and related litigation cause disruptions to our business and result in monetary fines and damages and other sanctions 

data privacy and security laws 

as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states hipaa privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy 

data privacy and security laws are rapidly evolving in particular a new broad privacy law in california the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” came into effect in january 2020 the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr discussed below and has already prompted several other states to consider similar legislation the ccpa has already been amended several times including through a november 2020 ballot initiative called the california privacy rights act “cpra” which will go into effect in january 2023 

across the european union the general data protection regulation “gdpr” imposes strict requirements in how we collect transmit process and retain personal data including among other things in certain circumstances a requirement for prompt notification of data breaches to supervisory authorities andor to data subjects with the risk of significant fines for noncompliance additionally after a july 2020 decision from the court of justice of the european union european regulators are requiring additional safeguards to facilitate the transfer of personal information from the european union to the united states and other certain jurisdictions 

several other countries such as china russia and brazil have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that meaningfully expand the compliance requirements around confidential personal andor sensitive data that we may have access to or process in the course of our business in china and russia privacy and security laws may require a copy of personal data relating to citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions brazil’s lei geral de proteção de dados “lgpd” increases compliance requirements related to privacy data protection and information security for businesses that are located or do business within brazil although the lgpd shares similarities with the gdpr it also contains a number of unique features including specific legal bases not found in the gdpr that allow an organization to process personal data and requirements for the role of a data protection officer in these countries and elsewhere the laws applicable to data privacy and security may require changes to business practices or additional investment for compliance purposes 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges and waste management and workplace health and safety for a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that our operations products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws such as 

• the international traffic in arms regulations administered by the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls which among other things impose license requirements on the export from the united states of defense articles and defense services listed on the united states munitions list 

• the export administration regulations administered by the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security which among other things impose licensing requirements on the export incountry transfer and reexport of certain dualuse goods technology and software which are items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications 

• the regulations administered by the us department of treasury office of foreign assets control which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries governments and persons based on united states foreign policy and national security considerations and 

• the import regulations administered by us customs and border protection 

other nations’ governments have implemented similar exportimport control and economic sanction regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available in markets worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

available information 

we maintain an internet website at wwwfortivecom where we make available free of charge our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with or furnishing such material to the sec our internet website and the information contained on or linked from that website are not incorporated by reference into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

risk related to our business operations 

the effect of the covid19 pandemic on our global operations and the operations of our customers suppliers and vendors is continuing to have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

our global operations expose us broadly to the covid19 pandemic in particular continued efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have caused us our suppliers and customers to reduce commercial activities and utilization of facilities and manufacturing sites adversely impacting demand for our products and services our ability to source required materials and components and our ability to manufacture sell and service our products in addition implementation of measures to help control the spread of the virus including internal workfromhome policies to protect the health of our employees and community travel restrictions social distancing measures and reopening restrictions have negatively impacted our collaboration efforts with our global colleagues customers vendors and service providers and increased the risk and cost of protecting against cyber attacks while we continue to implement global and local response teams incremental cost reduction efforts and business continuity efforts internally and with our customers suppliers and vendors the duration and extent of the operational and financial impact of the covid19 pandemic remains highly uncertain 

the degree to which covid19 impacts us going forward will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and therefore cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic its severity or the actions taken to contain the spread and impact of covid19 the general availability effectiveness and distribution of any vaccine and how quickly and to what extent normal economic market and operating conditions resume even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided as a public health matter we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy inperson collaboration efforts and consumer confidence 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt changes in global trade policies volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment and underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures political and social instability natural disasters terrorist attacks and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect us and our distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

• reducing demand for our products software and services limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies 

• increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories 

• increasing price competition in our served markets 

• supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products 

• increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets and 

• increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which in addition to increasing the risks identified above could result in preference actions against us 

in addition adverse general economic conditions may lead to instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us or our lenders are unable to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations we may not be able to make certain investments or acquisitions or fully execute our business plans and strategies furthermore our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets if there is instability in global capital and credit markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets and product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

many of our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see the section entitled “businesscompetition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new or enhanced products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences 

• allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects 

• anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations 

• differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization 

• innovate and develop new technologies and applications and acquire or obtain rights to thirdparty technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets 

• obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do 

• successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner price them competitively and costeffectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time and 

• stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies 

in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees our business may be harmed 

much of our future success and our ability to realize the benefit of our acquisitions and execute our portfolio strategy depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including our senior management in particular the markets for highly skilled employees and leaders in the technology and healthcare industries are extremely competitive our brand our culture our ability to provide competitive compensation our locations of operations and our reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain key employees in these competitive markets if we are not competitive or successful in our recruiting efforts if we cannot attract or retain key employees or if we do not adequately ensure effective succession planning or transfer of knowledge for our key employees our ability to deliver and execute on our operational development or portfolio strategies would be adversely affected 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties and some of which are managed on a decentralized independent basis by our operating companies to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers nation states cybercriminals computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar incidents in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above can interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects impacting safety cybersecurity or quality issues or the perception of such issues for our products and services can lead to personal injury death property damage data loss or other damages these events could lead to recalls or safety or other public alerts result in product or service downtime or the temporary or permanent removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls downtime removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities or components that we use in our operations 

as discussed in the section entitled “businessmaterials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items including as a result of contractual disputes with suppliers or vendors could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity or component prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity or component costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability contractual obligations or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating quality or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes including as a result of contractual disputes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints operational or quality issues bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters appropriate classification of franchisee relationship tax matters commercial disputes disputes with our supplier or vendors competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits we may experience disruption in supply or sales and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets that we were previously unable to estimate or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

risk related to our international operations 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2020 approximately 47 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are 

located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets such as eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia our international business including our business in highgrowth markets outside the united states is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations as well as increased risks due to significant uncertainties related to political and economic changes including 

• interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers 

• differences in terms of sale including payment terms 

• local product preferences and product requirements 

• changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including changes in relationship with the united states particularly with respect to china 

• trade protection measures increased trade barriers imposition of significant tariffs on imports or exports embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements 

• new conditions to and possible restrictions of existing free trade agreements 

• epidemics such as the coronavirus outbreak that adversely impact travel production or demand 

• unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements including negative changes in tax laws in the us and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products 

• the impact of the uk’s exit from the eu brexit on the company’s business operations in the uk and europe including the effects of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union the european atomic energy community and the united kingdom signed on december 30 2020 

• limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis and 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

trade relations between china and the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

we have experienced growth in various end markets in china during 2020 yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew slightly in china and sales in china accounted for approximately 12 of our total sales for the year in addition we have numerous facilities in china many of which serve multiple businesses and are used for multiple purposes 

there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and china including with respect to trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs in particular there continues to be uncertainty about us foreign trade policy with respect to china including any changes to the trade policies that may be adopted by the new administration any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade especially trade with china could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses transact in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the transaction currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable exchange rate effects we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

risk related to our acquisitions investments and dispositions 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our anticipated rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our anticipated rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates anticipated which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 

• any acquired business technology service or product could underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable 

• we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions or strategic relationships 

• acquisitions or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period or over the longterm 

• preclosing and postclosing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from period to period 

• acquisitions or strategic relationships could create demands on our management operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address 

• we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers 

• we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition or strategic relationship 

• we may assume by acquisition or strategic relationship unknown liabilities known contingent liabilities that become realized known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

• in connection with acquisitions we may enter into postclosing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments earnout obligations and indemnification obligations which may have unpredictable financial results 

• in connection with acquisitions we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets and 

• we may have interests that diverge from those of strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate exposing us to additional risk 

the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face 

unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment for example in 2018 we splitoff most of our automation and specialty platform in a reverse morris trust transaction with altra industrial motion corp and in 2020 we spunoff our former industrial technologies segment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

potential indemnification liabilities to vontier pursuant to the separation agreement could materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with vontier to govern the separation and distribution of vontier and the relationship between the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us if we are required to indemnify vontier under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to substantial liabilities in addition with respect to the liabilities for which vontier has agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against vontier will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that vontier will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations each of these risks could negatively affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risk related to regulatory and compliance matters 

changes in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment and electronic communications and market standardizations we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations and standards these regulations and standards are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change or delay in implementation in any of these regulations or standards or in the interpretation application or enforcement thereof could reduce or delay demand for our products and services increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations or implementation of industry standards on the timeline we expect in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or industry standards or the adoption of new regulations or industry standards which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines or industry standard implementation timelines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in 

addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations in addition some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous or energetic materials in the development manufacturing or servicing of our products we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements moreover any accident that results in significant personal injury or property damage whether occurring during development manufacturing servicing use or storage of our products may result in significant production interruption delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damage harm to our reputation and reduction in morale among our employees any of which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation

• we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws which may affect our transactions with certain customers business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries in certain circumstances export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products services and technologies in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory 

• we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements reductions in federal spending and other factors and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder which could result in loss of the contract we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts 

• we are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in multiple jurisdictions that regulate the collection use protection and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among countries in particular the general data protection regulation became effective in the european union in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act became effective in january 2020 we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines 

or other penalties that or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position 

• certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the us fda by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by certain accrediting bodies to varying degrees these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products and 

• we are also required to comply with ever changing labor and employment laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions these changes could negatively impact our business or financial position 

these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements 

for additional information regarding these risks please refer to the section entitled “businessregulatory matters” 

risk related to our tax and accounting matters 

changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 

a change in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we operate including any increase in us corporate income tax rates could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition foreign remittance taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change then our income tax expense could increase on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cut and jobs act “tcja” the tcja represents one of the most significant overhauls to the us federal tax code since 1986 according to the sec the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses and introduces changes that impact us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits further guidance regulations and technical corrections pertaining to tcja continue to be issued by the tax authorities some of which may have retroactive application we will continue to assess such new guidance regulations and corrections as they are issued however there can be no assurance that the retroactive applications of such new guidance regulations or corrections issued by the tax authorities will not result in revisions to our prior interpretation of the corresponding provisions of tcja that may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines the breadth of this project may impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and could materially impact the law for transfer pricing and permanent establishment taxation we have taken measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of these new oecd developments 

changes in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or 

assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate 

we could incur significant liability if the separation and distribution of vontier is determined to be a taxable transaction 

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of vontier qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355a and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from vontier and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the separation and distribution are taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the separation and distribution of vontier are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

changes in us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance any new or amended standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 106 billion in accordance with gaap we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized refer to note 2 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill and acquired intangibles 

risk related to our financing activities 

we have incurred a significant amount of debt and our debt will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 42 billion of longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt on a consolidated basis we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

• requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds 

• reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates and 

• resulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our debt or fail to comply with the financial or restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing such debt 

our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable 

to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our credit agreement include a debttoebitda ratio please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

the interest rates on our credit facilities may be impacted by the phase out of the london interbank offered rate “libor” 

pursuant to the terms of our credit facilities the interest rate on our credit facilities may be based on libor which is in the process of being phasedout the fca which regulates libor has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to libor through the end of 2021 but that the fca will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date accordingly there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of libor beyond 2021 and it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether or to what extent the withdrawal and replacement of libor would affect the company however the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to libor may have an adverse impact on the cost of our borrowings under our credit facilities 

risk related to shareholder rights 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation “restated certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws “amended and restated bylaws” contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors the “board” rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by the board these provisions include among others 

• the inability of our shareholders to call a special meeting 

• the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent 

• rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings 

• the right of the board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 

• the ability of our directors and not shareholders to fill vacancies including those resulting from an enlargement of the board on the board and 

• the requirement that the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 80 of our voting stock is required to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 

in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an “interested stockholder” shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board and by providing the board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with our company or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against our company and our directors and officers this exclusive forum provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the securities act the exchange act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction

basis of presentation 

on october 9 2020 we completed the separation of our former industrial technologies segment the “separation” by distributing 801 of the outstanding shares of vontier corporation “vontier” the entity we created to hold the corresponding businesses to fortive stockholders on a pro rata basis to effect the separation the company distributed to its stockholders two shares of vontier common stock for every five shares of the company’s common stock outstanding held on september 25 2020 the record date for the distribution with the company retaining 199 of the shares of vontier common stock immediately following the separation the “retained vontier shares” on january 19 2021 we completed an exchange of all of the retained vontier shares as part of a noncash debtforequity exchange that reduced outstanding indebtedness of fortive by 11 billion 

the accounting requirements for reporting the separation of vontier as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed accordingly the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the results of the vontier business as a discontinued operation fortive did not retain a controlling interest in vontier and therefore the fair value of the retained vontier shares and subsequent fair value changes are included in our assets of and results from continuing operations respectively the subsequent change in the fair value of the retained vontier shares and the resulting gain will be recorded in the first quarter of 2021 

on march 7 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement to combine four of our operating companies from our automation  specialty platform the “as business” with altra industrial motion corp “altra” in a taxefficient reverse morris trust transaction on october 1 2018 we completed the splitoff of the as business and have presented the results of operations of the as business in our consolidated statements of earnings and the related assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as discontinued operations these changes have been applied to all periods presented 

unless otherwise noted amounts percentages and discussion for all periods included in management’s discussion and analysis reflect the results of operations and financial condition from our continuing operations refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on discontinued operations 

in light of the vontier separation we changed our internal reporting structure on the first day of the fourth quarter september 26 2020 to reflect organizational and leadership changes that allow us to better assess the operational performance of and allocate resources to our businesses our chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources based on our new operating segments which are also our new reportable segments our new reportable segments are comprised of intelligent operating solutions precision technologies and advanced healthcare solutions refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments 

the discussion of historical information in management’s discussion and analysis has been recast to reflect the new reportable segments of our continuing operations 

overview 

general 

fortive is a multinational business with global operations with approximately 47 of our sales derived from customers outside the united states in 2020 as a company with global operations our businesses are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors our geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of products software and services we offer typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country except for the united states on our operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including their sales to the extent possible to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of opportunities and challenges including technological development in most of the markets we serve the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we define highgrowth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia with the exception of japan and australia we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality attract relevant talent and retain grow and empower our talented workforce and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 1 the impact from acquired businesses and purchase accounting adjustments 2 the impact of currency translation references to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture the portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales impact from acquired businesses and b the 

periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales impact from acquired businesses after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers we exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of longterm performance references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales 

business performance and outlook 

business performance 

a novel strain of coronavirus was first identified in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 “covid19” this outbreak has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world resulting in governments implementing strict measures to help contain or mitigate the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions school and commercial facility closures reopening restrictions among others collectively “virus control measures” these virus control measures have led to slowdowns or shutdowns for businesses deemed both “essential” and “nonessential” in affected areas causing significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the united states most notably during the first half of 2020 the majority of our essential production facilities around the world were open during 2020 and as of the date of this report all of our locations are open and operating 

given our businesses operate globally have diverse customers and serve multiple endmarkets covid19 impacted our businesses and operating results during 2020 directly with reduced yearoveryear demand from customers operating in nonessential endmarkets and indirectly with reduced demand created by macroeconomic disruption or disruption in adjacent endmarkets these disruptions impacted our operating results most severely during the second quarter of 2020 and we have realized sequential improvement in demand across all of our businesses and geographies since 

for the yearended december 31 2020 aggregate yearoveryear sales increased 15 as our continued application and deployment of the fortive business system and incremental sales from our recently acquired companies more than offset declines in demand from our existing businesses sales from existing businesses decreased 59 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the comparable period of 2019 reflecting the broad impacts of the covid19 pandemic as virus control measures were deployed in most regions and particularly impacted our results in the second quarter of 2020 with sequential improvement each quarter thereafter including a slight yearoveryear increase in demand from existing businesses during the fourth quarter 

sales that management considers recurring revenue represented approximately 40 of our total sales during the yearended december 31 2020 and increased approximately 11 yearoveryear including sales from our existing software as a service “saas” businesses that increased at a rate in the midteens yearoveryear 

geographically yearoveryear sales from existing businesses during the year ended december 31 2020 declined at a midsingle digit rate in both developed markets and highgrowth markets respectively which was driven by a highsingle digit rate decline in north america and latin america a midsingle digit rate decline in asia and a lowsingle digit rate decline in western europe yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew slightly in china during the year ended december 31 2020 

2021 outlook 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic overall global conditions have been volatile and uncertain while our results in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicate positive broadbased momentum across our portfolio economic uncertainties continue to exist the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future results will depend on the length severity and recurrence of virus control measures and the availability of antiviral medications and distribution and administration of vaccinations both of which are uncertain we plan to continue deploying the fortive business system to help drive nearterm performance and maximize cash flow generation amidst this uncertainty 

given the diverse nature of our businesses and the endmarkets they serve we believe certain of our businesses will continue being resilient against the broad covid19 impacts in the first quarter of 2021 while we believe others will continue being 

relatively more sensitive with varied rates of continued recovery as virus control measures remain in place the businesses we believe will continue being relatively more resilient include our businesses with a greater proportion of recurring revenue including our saas businesses that provide critical workflow solutions to their customers certain healthcare businesses and those with longer business cycles with strong backlogs we believe our businesses that are more dependent on shortcycle industrial demand and production dynamics will continue to sequentially improve but continue experiencing a somewhat challenging environment as such we expect yearoveryear global demand for our products and services in both the first quarter of 2021 and year ended december 31 2021 to grow at a midsingle digit rate 

despite the virus control measures in place in geographies critical to our supply chain we have successfully implemented solutions to support our operations and have not experienced significant production material shortages supply chain constraints or distribution limitations impacting our operations as of the date of this report however in light of the uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic severity and duration we are continuing to evaluate and monitor the condition of our supply chain including the financial health of our suppliers and their ability to access raw materials and other key inputs and may experience shortages constraints or disruptions during the first quarter of 2021 or in future periods 

we are closely monitoring the health of our employees and continue to implement safety protocols at our facilities to help ensure their health and safety in addition we continue to monitor our suppliers and customers and their ability to maintain production capacity to meet our operational requirements individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 or who are unable to report to work due to virus control measures may significantly disrupt production throughout our supply chain and negatively impact our sales channels further our customers may be directly impacted by business curtailments or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to accept shipments of products may cancel orders and may not be able to pay us on a timely basis 

to mitigate the impact of the economic conditions from the covid19 pandemic as well as any escalation of geopolitical uncertainties related to governmental policies toward international trade monetary and fiscal policies and relations between the us and china we will continue applying and deploying the fortive business system to actively manage our supply chain drive operating efficiencies and continue to collaborate with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruption to their businesses additionally we will continue actively managing our working capital to maximize cash flows and cost efficiency and assess market conditions taking actions as we deem necessary to appropriately position our businesses in light of the economic environment and geopolitical uncertainties 

while covid19 has created volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets we have not experienced a significant impact on our financial position liquidity and ability to meet our debt covenants as of the filing date of this report however we continue to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions if further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely affect our access to the capital markets we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing available capacity under our credit facilities to provide shortterm funding refer to the “liquidity and capital resources” section for additional discussion 

completed divestitures acquisitions and business combinations 

on october 9 2020 we completed the separation by distributing 801 of the outstanding shares of vontier to our stockholders on a pro rata basis to effect the separation we distributed to our stockholders two shares of vontier common stock for every five shares of fortive common stock outstanding held on september 25 2020 the record date for the distribution and retained 199 of the shares of vontier common stock immediately following the separation the accounting requirements for reporting the separation of vontier as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed 

on september 29 2020 vontier entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of banks consisting of a threeyear 800 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility the “threeyear term loans” a twoyear 1 billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility the “twoyear term loans” and together with the threeyear term loans the “term loans” and a threeyear 750 million senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and together with the term loans the “credit facilities” on the distribution date vontier drew down the full 18 billion available under the term loans vontier used the proceeds from the term loans to make payments to the company with 16 billion used as part of the consideration for the contribution of certain assets and liabilities to vontier by the company in connection with the separation and 202 million used as an adjustment for excess cash balances remaining with vontier collectively the “cash consideration” the company will apply the cash consideration to repay certain outstanding indebtedness interest on certain debt instruments and to pay certain of the company’s regular quarterly cash dividends refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the description of the debt repayments made 

in preparation for and executing the separation the company incurred 84 million and 35 million in vontier standup and separationrelated transaction costs during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively which have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements these standup and separationrelated costs primarily relate to professional and advisory fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance tax legal and information system functions 

in connection with the separation fortive and vontier entered into various agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for vontier’s relationship with fortive after the separation including a transition services agreement an employee matters agreement a tax matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a fortive business system “fbs” license agreement and a stockholder’s and registration rights agreement these agreements govern the separation between fortive and vontier of the assets employees liabilities and obligations including its investments property and employee benefits and taxrelated assets and liabilities of fortive and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to at and after vontier’s separation and also govern certain relationships between fortive and vontier after the separation 

advanced sterilization products acquisition

operating expenses 



sga expenses increased during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to higher amortization and incremental expenses from our recently acquired businesses that were mostly offset by broad cost reduction efforts that reduced labor expenses to better align with reductions in demand during the second and third quarter of 2020 primarily through the use of furloughs and reductions in salaried compensation costs as well as other reductions in discretionary spending to a lesser extent yearoveryear sga expenses were reduced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and yearoveryear net cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives sga expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent yearoveryear

interest expense net of 149 million was recorded during 2020 compared to 143 million during 2019 and 77 million during 2018 yearoveryear interest expense increased in 2020 and 2019 due to higher average debt balances during the year in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities andor access the capital markets if we enter into such additional financing transactions the amount of annual interest expense will increase 

unrealized gain on investment in vontier corporation 

on october 9 2020 we completed the vontier separation and retained 199 of the shares of vontier common stock immediately following the separation we did not retain a controlling interest in vontier and therefore the subsequent fair value changes of the retained vontier shares are included in our results from continuing operations at december 31 2020 the 

retained vontier shares were remeasured at fair value based on vontier’s closing stock price with unrealized gains of 11 billion recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings 

on january 19 2021 we completed an exchange of all of the retained vontier shares as part of a noncash debtforequity exchange that reduced outstanding indebtedness of fortive by 11 billion 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements we record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” the us government continues to issue significant amounts of tcja guidance and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future the company is actively monitoring the impact of new treasury regulations any future adjustments resulting from retrospective guidance issued will be considered as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the interim period the guidance is issued 

our effective tax rate can be affected by among others changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines the breadth of this project may impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and could materially impact the law for transfer pricing and permanent establishment taxation we have taken measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of these new oecd developments 

we conduct business globally and as part of our global business we file numerous income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions after the tcja our ability to obtain a tax benefit in certain countries that continue to have lower statutory tax rates than the united states is dependent on our levels of taxable income in such foreign countries we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments the company is subject to examination in the united states various states and foreign jurisdiction for the tax years 2010 to 2020 we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities in connection with the separation of fortive from danaher on july 1 2016 the “separation” we entered into the agreements with danaher including a tax matters agreement the tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “joint” filings compared to “separate” filings prior to the separation “joint” filings involve legal entities such as those in the united states that include operations from both danaher and the company by contrast “separate” filings involve certain entities primarily outside of the united states that exclusively include either danaher’s or the company’s operations respectively in accordance with the tax matters agreement the company is liable for and has indemnified danaher against all income tax liabilities involving “separate” filings for the periods prior to the separation 

during 2018 the company entered into a tax matters agreement in connection with the splitoff of the as business the company remains liable for predisposition income tax liabilities related to the as business 

in connection with the separation of vontier we entered into a tax matters agreement with vontier the tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “joint” filings compared to “separate” filings prior to the separation “joint” filings involve legal entities such as those in the united states that include operations from both vontier and the company by contrast “separate” filings involve certain entities primarily outside of the united states that exclusively include either vontier’s or the company’s operations respectively in accordance with the tax matters agreement the company remains liable for all income tax liabilities involving “joint” filings and vontier has agreed to indemnify the company against all income tax liabilities involving “separate” filings for periods prior to the separation 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was 37 204 and 134 respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2020 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate offset by tax costs associated with repatriating a portion of our previously reinvested earnings outside of the united states and a permanent difference on the unrealized gain on our retained vontier shares due to the taxfree treatment of our disposition of the shares through the debtforequity exchange that was completed on january 19 2021 the debtforequity exchange included an exchange of all of our vontier common stock owned as of december 31 2020 

our effective tax rate for 2019 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law and earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate 

our effective tax rate for 2018 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law earnings outside the united states that are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and the effect of adjustments to the provision estimates recorded in 2017 related to the tcja as permitted under the sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” issued on december 22 2017 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased by 895 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to an increase in net earnings of 874 million including both continuing and discontinued operations favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 13 million and favorable changes in pension benefit adjustments of 8 million the increase in net earnings from 2019 to 2020 was due to the recognition of a 11 billion unrealized gain on the retained vontier shares 

comprehensive income decreased by 20 billion in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to a decrease in net earnings of 22 billion including both continuing and discontinued operations which were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 178 million and unfavorable changes in pension benefit adjustments of 24 million the decrease in net earnings from 2018 to 2019 was due to the recognition of a 19 billion gain in 2018 related to the divestiture of the as business 

financial instruments and risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk and commodity prices each of which could impact our financial statements we generally address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities in addition our broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

we manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2020 an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 166 million  

as of december 31 2020 our variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of term loan borrowings refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2020 as a result our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates the annual effective rate associated 

with our outstanding 2020 delayeddraw term loan and 2021 term loan for the year ended december 31 2020 was 189 and 188 respectively and we recorded interest expense of 283 million on these variablerate obligations a hypothetical 10 basis points increase in market interest rates as of december 31 2020 on our variablerate debt obligations as of december 31 2020 would have increased our interest expense by 14 million in 2020 the 2021 term loan was extinguished as part of the debtforequity exchange on january 19 2021 and the 2020 delayeddraw term loan was repaid on january 21 2021 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary we also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2020 would have resulted in a reduction of foreign currencydenominated net assets and stockholders’ equity of approximately 185 million 

currency exchange rates favorably impacted 2020 reported sales by 01 as compared to 2019 as the us dollar was on average weaker against most major currencies during 2020 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2019 if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2020 were to prevail throughout 2021 currency exchange rates would positively impact 2021 estimated sales by approximately 20 relative to our performance in 2020 in general additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact our sales and results of operations 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and highlyliquid investment grade cash equivalents and receivables from customers we place cash and cash equivalents with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents we emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity which consist of access to shortterm loans commercial paper and our revolving credit facility in addition to shortterm liquidity benefits provided by cash repatriation will be sufficient to allow us to continue funding and investing in our existing businesses consummate strategic acquisitions make interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness fulfill our contractual obligations and manage our capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

on march 27 2020 the us federal government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the covid19 outbreak which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions some of these tax provisions are expected to be effective retroactively for years ending before the date of enactment we anticipate the provisions of the cares act will impact income tax in 2020 however we have not identified material impacts to the tax provision as of december 31 2020 additionally the cares act will continue providing us with shortterm liquidity and other potential tax impacts that we are continuing to evaluate during 2020 

we deferred remittance of approximately 35 million in payroll tax payments half of which will be due on december 31 2021 and the remaining portion on december 31 2022 

while covid19 created volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets during 2020 we have not realized a significant impact on our financial position liquidity and ability to meet our debt covenants as of the filing date of this report however we continue to monitor the capital markets and general global economic conditions the financial markets worldwide including the united states have been impacted by covid19 and this volatility and disruption during the first half of 2020 impacted broad access to the capital markets and pricing on new indebtedness our credit facilities including our revolving credit facility are predominately with institutions that to date have been relatively unaffected by the disruption however the distress in the 

financial markets during the first half of 2020 resulted in volatility and disruption in the commercial paper market and as a result of the volatility and disruption we refinanced all of our outstanding commercial paper with borrowings under our 750 million 364day delayeddraw term loan the “2021 term loan” as detailed below we may utilize our commercial paper programs as a source of liquidity if and when the commercial paper markets are reliable and attractive in the future

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity 



operating activities 

operating cash flows from continuing operations can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 978 million in 2020 an increase of 276 million or approximately 39 as compared to 2019 this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors 

• 2020 operating cash flows were impacted by higher net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2019 which were driven by a yearoveryear increase in operating profits of 96 million and a yearoveryear increase in interest expense of 6 million primarily associated with our financing activities the yearoveryear increase in operating profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of 43 million largely attributable to our recently acquired businesses further the yearoveryear increase in net earnings for 2020 was impacted by the recognition of a 11 billion unrealized gain on the retained vontier shares depreciation amortization and the unrealized gain are noncash expenses that impact earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows 

• the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable provided 93 million of operating cash flows during 2020 compared to using 59 million of cash during 2019 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period 

• the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided 208 million of cash in 2020 as compared to providing 148 million in 2019 the year over year change was largely driven by the timing of tax payments and various employee benefit accruals 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 702 million in 2019 an increase of 18 million or approximately 3 as compared to 2018 this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors 

• 2019 operating cash flows were impacted by lower net earnings from continuing operations as compared to 2018 net earnings for 2019 were impacted by a yearoveryear decrease in operating profits of 201 million and a yearoveryear increase in interest expense of 65 million primarily associated with our financing activities which was partially offset by a 41 million noncash gain on the combination of the tektronix video business with telestream the yearoveryear decrease in operating profit was attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of 167 million largely attributable to our recently acquired businesses depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows 

• the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable used 59 million of operating cash flows during 2019 compared to using 10 million of cash during 2018 the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period 

• the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided 148 million of cash in 2019 as compared to providing 15 million in 2018 the year over year change was largely driven by the timing of tax payments and various employee benefit accruals 

investing activities 

investing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was approximately 111 million during 2020 compared to approximately 40 billion and 28 billion of net cash used in 2019 and 2018 respectively for a discussion of our acquisitions refer to “—overview” 

capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting product development initiatives improving information technology systems and purchase of equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers capital expenditures totaled 76 million in 2020 75 million in 2019 and 70 million in 2018 we expect capital spending to be between approximately 75 million and 85 million in 2021 though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

financing activities and indebtedness 

financing cash flows from continuing operations consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance of equity the issuance and repayments of debt and commercial paper payments of quarterly cash dividends to shareholders and cash consideration received from the vontier separation financing activities from continuing operations used cash of 676 million in 2020 compared to generating 28 billion and 873 million of cash in 2019 and 2018 respectively in 2020 we made net repayments of 11 billion of commercial paper borrowings 500 million of our 2020 term loan 750 million of our 235 senior notes due 2021 and ¥138 billion of our yen variable interest rate term loan due 2022 which approximated 131 million which were partially offset by 16 billion in net cash consideration received from the separation and the net proceeds we received from the issuance of our 2021 term loan of 350 million during the year ended december 31 2020 we paid 163 million of cash dividends to common shareholders and holders of our mcps 

refer to “—liquidity and capital resources” section above for a description of our financing activities in 2020 2019 and 2018 

we generally expect to satisfy any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs and term loans while covid19 created volatility and uncertainty in the commercial paper market we may utilize our commercial paper programs as a source of liquidity if and when the commercial paper markets are reliable and attractive in the future credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by the revolving credit facility 

the carrying value of total debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 was approximately 42 billion we had 20 billion available under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness 

the availability of the revolving credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the commercial paper programs when we have outstanding 

borrowings as of december 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program we expect to limit any future borrowings under the revolving credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow if needed to repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

in 2019 we received net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs of 495 million received proceeds from borrowings of 29 billion repaid 455 million of borrowings and paid 163 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

dividends 

on november 5 2020 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007 per common share paid on december 28 2020 to holders of record on november 27 2020 in addition we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 1250 per share of our 500 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a payable to preferred stockholders of record on december 15 2020 the dividend to preferred shareholders was paid on december 31 2020 

aggregate cash payments for the dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended december 31 2020 were 163 million and were recorded as dividends to shareholders in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows 

on january 26 2021 we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share payable on march 26 2021 to common stockholders of record on february 26 2021 and a regular quarterly cash dividend of 1250 per share on our mcps payable on april 1 2021 to preferred stockholders of record on march 15 2021 

cash and cash requirements 

cash 

as of december 31 2020 we held approximately 18 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investmentgrade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an annual effective rate of approximately 030 approximately 60 of our cash at december 31 2020 was held in the us 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund our pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs or objectives with respect to our cash requirements we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs we also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

given the impact of the covid19 pandemic and resulting market conditions in the us we have updated our assertion for previously unremitted earnings from 2019 and prior periods due to new facts and circumstances that we did not face in prior periods the tcja eliminated the us tax cost for qualified repatriation beginning in 2018 but foreign cumulative earnings remain subject to foreign remittance taxes during the year ended december 31 2020 we provided foreign remittance taxes of 13 million on the repatriation of 310 million of previously unremitted earnings from 2019 and prior periods 

we have made an assertion regarding the amount of current earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs local law restrictions high foreign remittance costs previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions or future growth needs for most of our foreign operations we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment the amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings 

cash requirements 

the following table sets forth a summary of our shortterm and longterm cash requirements as of december 31 2020 under 1 longterm debt principal and interest obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected 

on our balance sheet under gaap certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain 



in addition to the obligations noted above we have issued guarantees consisting primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure our obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions these guarantees are not recorded on our balance sheet and 61 million in commitments expire within one year of december 31 2020 and 26 million later than one year from december 31 2020 

during 2020 we contributed 1 million and 11 million to our us and nonus defined benefit pension plans respectively during 2021 our cash contribution requirements for our us and nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 1 million and 12 million respectively the ultimate amounts we will contribute depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

as of december 31 2020 we expect to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future including our cash needs in the united states 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical 

experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  in june 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “asu 201613” which amended the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forwardlooking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments including trade accounts and unbilled receivables 

on january 1 2020 we adopted asu 201613 and recognized in our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2020 an increase in the allowance for trade accounts financing and unbilled receivables of 400 million of which 115 million related to our continuing operations with a corresponding net of tax adjustment to beginning retained earnings of 313 million 

results for reporting periods beginning january 1 2020 reflect the adoption of asu 201613 while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting practices 

prior to the adoption of asu 201613 on january 1 2020 we recognized an allowance for incurred losses when they were probable based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including delinquency after the adoption of asu 201613 we measure our allowance to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset we pool assets with similar risk characteristics for this measurement based on attributes that may include asset type duration andor credit risk rating the future expected losses of each pool are estimated based on numerous quantitative and qualitative factors reflecting management’s estimate of collectibility over the remaining contractual life of the pooled assets including 

• duration 

• historical current and forecasted future loss experience by asset type 

• historical current and forecasted delinquency and writeoff trends 

• historical current and forecasted economic conditions and 

• historical current and forecasted credit risk 

we regularly perform detailed reviews of our trade accounts and unbilled receivable portfolios to determine if changes in the aforementioned qualitative and quantitative factors have impacted the adequacy of the allowances 

volatility and uncertainty in overall global economic conditions and worldwide capital markets as a result of the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay and as a result may increase the difficulty in collecting trade accounts and unbilled receivables we did not realize notable increases in loss rates and delinquencies during the year ended december 31 2020 and given the nature of our portfolio of receivables our historical experience during times of challenging economic conditions and our forecasted future impact of covid19 on our customer’s ability to pay we did not record material provisions for credit losses as a result of the covid19 pandemic during the year ended december 31 2020 if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our current estimates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we would be required to writeoff additional receivable balances which would adversely impact our net earnings and financial condition in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the calculation of our allowance we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease in anticipated collectibility noting that our allowance would increase by 4 million with a corresponding charge to sga 

expected credit losses of the assets originated during the year ended december 31 2020 as well as changes to expected losses during the same periods are recognized in earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 

inventories  we record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the net realizable value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory which would adversely impact our financial statements in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the calculation of the net realizable value of our inventory we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the anticipated realization noting that our inventory would 

decrease by 8 million with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding our inventory balances as of december 31 2020 

acquired intangibles and goodwill  our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur refer to notes 2 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing our goodwill impairment testing we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach we estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

in 2020 we had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in continuing operations reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment we believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth as of the date of the 2020 annual impairment test the carrying value of goodwill in each reporting unit ranged from 171 million to 32 billion our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2020 indicated that in all instances the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge 

the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 50 to approximately 675 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 30 to approximately 600 we evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of the reporting units including as applicable results of the estimated fair value using an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and concluded no impairment charges were required 

we review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements if the reserves we established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we derive revenues from the sale of products and services revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services in determining if control has transferred we consider whether certain 

indicators of the transfer of control are present such as the transfer of title present right to payment significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality to determine the consideration that the customer owes us we make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates consisting primarily of volume discounts and other shortterm incentive programs refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 

if our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected historically our estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

stockbased compensation  for a description of our stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate given our limited trading history following the separation from danaher stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stock options in the postseparation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies beginning august 2018 expected volatility was based on a weighted average blend of our historical stock price volatility from july 2 2016 the date of the danaher separation through the stock option grant date and the average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies for the expected term of the options the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension and other post employment benefits  for a description of our pension accounting practices refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements certain of our us and nonus employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors our financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans during 2020 would have increased the net obligation by 30 million from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2020 

our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 125 to 486 if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets during 2020 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense in 2020 would have increased by 1 million 1 million on an aftertax basis 

income taxes  for a description of our income tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with gaap deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on our tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate if we experience cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years we normally conclude that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if we experience cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years we then consider a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country we would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction we establish a valuation allowance 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if in our assessment it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense 

in addition we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments see “results of operations  income taxes” and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary 

an increase in our 2020 effective tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 of 15 million

the following discussion includes information common to both of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including electronic components steel plastics and other petroleumbased products cast iron aluminum and copper prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world tariffs affect our costs for impacted materials or components we import into the united states no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2019 we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to fortive 

competition 

we believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed applications expertise distribution channel access service and support technology and innovation breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve for example capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to oems are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in either of our reportable segments in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the following sets forth the unfulfilled orders and annual average contract value of signed contracts for our software as a service product offering attributable to each of our segments as of december 31  in millions 



we expect that a majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2019 will be delivered to customers within two to three months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog in 2019 is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 25000 persons of whom approximately 13000 were employed in the united states and approximately 12000 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 900 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils the company believes that its relationship with employees is good 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2019 was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and governmentowned entities for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters

international operations 

our products and services are available in markets worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

major customers 

no customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated sales in 2019  2018  or 2017

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

risks related to our business 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt changes in global trade policies volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment and underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures political and social instability natural disasters terrorist attacks and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect us and our distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 in addition adverse general economic conditions may lead to instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us or our lenders are unable to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations we may not be able to make certain investments or acquisitions or fully execute our business plans and strategies furthermore our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets if there is instability in global capital and credit markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our plans to separate into two independent publicly traded companies may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

on september 4 2019 we announced our intention to separate into two independent publicly traded companies the separation if effectuated will create i an industrial technology company retaining the fortive name with a differentiated portfolio of growthoriented businesses focused on connected workflow solutions that incorporate advanced sensors instrumentation software data and analytics and ii a global industrial company “vontier” consisting of our transportation technologies and franchise distribution platforms with a focus on growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving transportation and mobility markets 

our ability to effectuate the separation the structure of the separation and the anticipated benefits of the separation may be adversely and materially impacted by adverse market conditions possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings regulatory approvals or clearances uncertainty of the financial markets our business performance and unanticipated delays in establishing infrastructure or processes for vontier in addition the cost and resources required to effectuate the separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets and product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

many of our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see the section entitled “businesscompetition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new or enhanced products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

changes in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment and electronic communications and market standardizations such as the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standard we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations and standards these regulations and standards are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change or delay in implementation in any of these regulations or standards or in the interpretation application or enforcement thereof could reduce or delay demand for our products and services increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations or implementation of industry standards on the timeline we expect in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or industry standards or the adoption of new regulations or industry standards which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines or industry standard implementation timelines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

trade relations between china and the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

we have experienced growth in various end markets in china during 2019 yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew slightly in china and sales in china accounted for approximately 8 of our total sales for the year in addition we have numerous facilities in china many of which serve multiple businesses and are used for multiple purposes 

there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and china including with respect to trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs in particular there continues to be uncertainty about us foreign trade policy with respect to china there is a risk of escalation and retaliatory actions between the two countries in addition the current administration certain members of congress and federal officials have stated that united states may seek to implement more protective trade measures not just with respect to china but with respect to other countries in the asia pacific region as well any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade especially trade with china could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our anticipated rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our anticipated rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates anticipated which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 



 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 



increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations in addition some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous or energetic materials in the development manufacturing or servicing of our products we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements moreover any accident that results in significant personal injury or property damage whether occurring during development manufacturing servicing use or storage of our products may result in significant production interruption delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damage harm to our reputation and reduction in morale among our employees any of which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial 

statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to the section entitled “businessregulatory matters” 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2019  approximately 43 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets such as eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia our international business including our business in highgrowth markets outside the united states is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations as well as increased risks due to significant uncertainties related to political and economic changes including 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2019  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 122 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized refer to notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill and acquired intangibles 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of 

our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses transact in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the transaction currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable exchange rate effects we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

the interest rates on our credit facilities may be impacted by the phase out of the london interbank offered rate “libor” 

pursuant to the terms of our credit facilities the interest rate on our credit facilities may be based on libor which is in the process of being phasedout the fca which regulates libor has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to libor through the end of 2021 but that the fca will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date accordingly there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of libor beyond 2021 and it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether or to what extent the withdrawal and replacement of libor would affect the company however the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to libor may have an adverse impact on the cost of our borrowings under our credit facilities 

changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income 

furthermore a change in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we operate could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition foreign remittance taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change then our income tax expense could increase on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cut and jobs act “tcja” the tcja represents one of the most significant overhauls to the us federal tax code since 1986 according to the sec the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses and introduces changes that impact us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits further guidance regulations and technical corrections pertaining to tcja continue to be issued by the tax authorities some of which may have retroactive application we will continue to assess such new guidance regulations and corrections as they are issued however there can be no assurance that the retroactive applications of such new guidance regulations or corrections issued by the tax authorities will not result in revisions to our prior interpretation of the corresponding provisions of tcja that may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines we have taken comprehensive measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy in addition the oecd has announced additional guidance that will be forthcoming in 2020 that could materially impact the law for transfer pricing and permanent establishment taxation the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of these new oecd developments 

changes in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate 

we have incurred a significant amount of debt and our debt will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 63 billion of longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt on a consolidated basis we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our credit agreement include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the end of any fiscal quarter a consolidated net leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of less than 350 to 100 or for four consecutive quarters immediately following the consummation of any qualified acquisition less than 400 to 100 in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of greater than 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters appropriate classification of franchisee relationship tax matters commercial disputes disputes with our supplier or vendors competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits we may experience disruption in supply or sales and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets that we were previously unable to estimate or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period 

we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties and some of which are managed on a decentralized independent basis by our operating companies to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers nation states cybercriminals computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar incidents in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects impacting safety cybersecurity or quality issues or the perception of such issues for our products and services can lead to personal injury death property damage data loss or other damages these events could lead to recalls or safety or other public alerts result in product or service downtime or the temporary or permanent removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls downtime removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities or components that we use in our operations 

as discussed in the section entitled “businessmaterials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items including as a result of contractual disputes with suppliers or vendors could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity or component prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity or component costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability contractual obligations or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating quality or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes including as a result of contractual disputes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints operational or quality issues bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have certain us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation “restated certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws “amended and restated bylaws” contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors the “board” rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by the board these provisions include among others 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an “interested stockholder” shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date 

on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board and by providing the board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 

however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

changes in us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with our company or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against our company and our directors and officers this exclusive forum provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the securities act the exchange act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction

overview 

general 

fortive is a multinational business with global operations please see “item 1 business – general” included in this annual report for a discussion of the company’s strategies for delivering longterm shareholder value during 2019  approximately 43 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified industrial technology growth company with global operations our businesses are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors our geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of our products software and services typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country except for the united states on our operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including their sales to the extent possible to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of opportunities and challenges including technological development in most of the markets we serve the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we define highgrowth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia with the exception of japan and australia we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” but excluding 1 the impact from acquired businesses and 2 the impact of currency translation references to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture the portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales impact from acquired businesses and b the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales impact from acquired businesses after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers we exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of longterm performance references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among our businesses on an overall basis demand for our hardware and software products and services increased during 2019 as compared to 2018 resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth of 134 and sales growth from existing businesses of 20  our continued application and deployment of the fortive business system including investments in sales growth initiatives and new product introductions as well as increased demand in developed markets and other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to overall sales growth from existing businesses 

on a yearoveryear basis our industrial technologies segment reported sales growth from existing businesses of 52  while sales from existing businesses in our professional instrumentation segment declined slightly in our industrial technologies segment the liability shift related to enhanced credit card security requirements for outdoor payment systems that is expected to occur in october 2020 in the united states based on the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standards is continuing to drive demand within our transportation technologies platform the decline in our professional instrumentation segment reflects slowing macroeconomic conditions across most major markets in 2019 

geographically sales from existing businesses grew at a lowsingle digit rate in developed markets and were relatively flat in high growth markets during 2019 as compared to 2018  yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew at a highsingle digit rate in latin america and grew at midsingle digit rate in north america while sales from existing businesses declined at a lowdouble digit rate in india and at a lowsingle digit rate in western europe sales from existing businesses in china increased slightly yearoveryear 

we expect overall sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2020  however we continue to monitor developments from macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties including global uncertainties related to governmental policies toward international trade monetary and fiscal policies including the current uncertainty about the future trade relationship between the united states and china and the impacts of the coronavirus as well as other factors identified in “item 1a risk factors”

components of sales growth 



2019 compared to 2018 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s transportation technologies businesses grew at a highsingle digit rate during 2019 as compared to 2018  due primarily to broadbased demand for fuel management systems specifically in north america and western europe as well as increased demand for payment solutions results in north america were favorably impacted by the approaching deadline for the liability shift related to outdoor emv global standards that is expected to occur in october 2020 geographically sales from existing businesses increased on a yearoveryear basis in north america europe and latin america which were partially offset by declines in india 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s franchise distribution businesses grew at a lowsingle digit rate during 2019 as compared to 2018  largely driven by increased yearoveryear demand for hardline and diagnostic tools and shop equipment which was partially offset by a decline in demand for wheel service equipment

operating profit margin increased 40 basis points during 2019 as compared to 2018  yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 

 yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by 



cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2019 as compared to 2018 is due primarily to the incremental cost of sales from our recently acquired businesses higher yearoveryear sales volumes from existing businesses increased material costs associated primarily with inflationary pressures and recently enacted tariffs and restructuring charges which were partially offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with productivity improvement initiatives and material cost and supply chain improvement actions changes in currency exchange rates decreased costs of sales in 2019 

the yearoveryear increase in gross profit during 2019 as compared to 2018 is due primarily to the favorable impact of pricing improvements from existing businesses higher yearoveryear sales volumes including sales volumes from our recently acquired businesses yearoveryear cost savings associated with productivity improvement initiatives and material cost and supply chain improvement actions 

the 120 basis point decrease in gross profit margin yearoveryear is due primarily to unfavorable sales mix acquisitionrelated fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and inventory and increased material costs associated primarily with inflationary pressures and recently enacted tariffs which more than offset the favorable impact of pricing improvements from existing businesses and yearoveryear cost savings associated with productivity improvement initiatives and material cost and supply chain improvement actions 

operating expenses 



sga expenses increased during 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to higher amortization and incremental expenses from our recently acquired businesses costs associated with the asp acquisition and the planned separation of fortive into two independent publicly traded companies restructuring actions and sales and marketing growth initiatives partially offset by cost savings associated with productivity improvement initiatives and changes in foreign currency exchange rates sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased 350 basis points in 2019 as compared to 2018  

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs increased during 2019 as compared to 2018 due to incremental yearoveryear investments in our product development initiatives and incremental expenses from recently acquired businesses on a yearoveryear basis rd expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat as the investments in our product development initiatives grew at rate largely consistent with sales 

interest costs 

for a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net of 164 million was recorded during 2019 compared to 97 million during 2018  interest expense increased in 2019 due to higher average debt balances during the year in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities andor access the capital markets if we enter into such additional financing transactions the amount of annual interest expense will increase 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements we record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” the us government continues to issue significant amounts of tcja guidance and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future the company is actively monitoring the impact of new treasury regulations any future adjustments resulting from retrospective guidance issued after december 31 2019 will be considered as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the interim period the guidance is issued 

our effective tax rate can be affected by among others changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” initiative on base erosion and profit shifting 

in 2019 the oecd issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines we have taken comprehensive measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy in addition the oecd has announced additional guidance that will be forthcoming in 2020 that could materially impact the law for transfer pricing and permanent establishment taxation the company will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of these new oecd developments 

we conduct business globally and as part of our global business we file numerous income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions after the tcja our ability to obtain a tax benefit in certain countries that continue to have lower statutory tax rates than the united states is dependent on our levels of taxable income in such foreign countries we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments the company is subject to examination in the united states various states and foreign jurisdiction for the tax years 2010 to 2019 we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities in connection with the separation of fortive from danaher on july 1 2016 the “separation” we entered into the agreements with danaher including a tax matters agreement the tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “joint” filings compared to “separate” filings prior to the separation “joint” filings involve legal entities such as those in the united states that include operations from both danaher and the company by contrast “separate” filings involve certain entities primarily outside of the united states that exclusively include either danaher’s or the company’s operations respectively in accordance with the tax matters agreement the company is liable for and has indemnified danaher against all income tax liabilities involving “separate” filings for the periods prior to the separation 

during 2018 the company entered into a tax matters agreement in connection with the splitoff of the as business the company remains liable for predisposition income tax liabilities related to the as business 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 170 and 148  respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2019 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law and earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate offset by tax costs related to transactions completed in 2019 in anticipation of the separation into two independent publicly traded companies 

our effective tax rate for 2018 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law earnings outside the united states that are taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and the effect of adjustments to the provision estimates recorded in 2017 related to the tcja as permitted under sab 118 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased by 20 billion in 2019 as compared to 2018  due to net earnings including both continuing and discontinued operations that were lower by 22 billion which were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 178 million  the decrease in net earnings from 2018 to 2019 was due to the recognition of a 19 billion gain in 2018 related to the divestiture of the as business unfavorable pension benefit adjustments in 2019 were 20 million compared to favorable adjustments of 4 million in 2018  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on our revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended december 31 2019 or 2018  

financial instruments and risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk and commodity prices each of which could impact our financial statements we generally address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities in addition our broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

we manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2019  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 146 million  

as of december 31 2019  our variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper and term loan borrowings refer to note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2019  as a result our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature we anticipate issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations and term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings the annual effective rate associated with our outstanding us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper 2020 term loan delayeddraw term loan due 2020 and yen term loan for the year ended december 31 2019 was approximately 247  010  251  295  and 050  respectively and we recorded interest expense of 48 million on these variablerate obligations a hypothetical 10 basis points increase in market interest rates as of december 31 2019 on our variablerate debt obligations as of december 31 2019 would have increased our interest expense by 3 million in 2019  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary we also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2019 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately 300 million  

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2019 reported sales by 18 as compared to 2018  as the us dollar was on average stronger against most major currencies during 2019 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2018  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2019 were to prevail throughout 2020  currency exchange rates would positively impact 2020 estimated sales by approximately 02 relative to our performance in 2019  in general additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact our sales and results of operations 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 

credit risk 

we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and highlyliquid investment grade cash equivalents and receivables from customers we place cash and cash equivalents with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents we emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in existing businesses consummate strategic acquisitions make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and manage our capital structure on a short and longterm basis refer also to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

2019 financing and capital transactions 

during 2019 we completed the following financing and capital transactions 

 the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of 0875 per year payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning on august 15 2019 the convertible notes mature on february 15 2022 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 93777 shares per 1000 principal amount of convertible notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 10664 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events the initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 325 to 

the 8048 per share closing price of our common stock on february 19 2019 upon conversion of the convertible notes holders will receive cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at fortive’s election our current intention is to settle such conversions through cash up to the principal amount of the converted convertible notes and if applicable through shares of our common stock for conversion value if any in excess of the principal amount of the converted convertible notes 

of the 14 billion in proceeds received from the issuance of the convertible notes 13 billion was classified as debt and 1022 million was classified as equity using an assumed effective interest rate of 338 debt issuance costs of 243 million were proportionately allocated to debt and equity we recognized 454 million in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2019 of which 108 million related to the contractual coupon rate of 0875 and 66 million was attributable to the amortization of debt issuance costs the discount at issuance was 1022 million and is being amortized over a threeyear period the unamortized discount at december 31 2019 was 742 million  



2018 financing and capital transactions 

during 2018 we completed the following financing and capital transactions 



overview of cash flows and liquidity 

following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity 



operating activities 

continuing operations cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 13 billion in 2019  an increase of 84 million  or approximately 7  as compared to 2018  this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors 



investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was approximately 41 billion during 2019 compared to approximately 30 billion of net cash used in 2018  for a discussion of our acquisitions refer to “—overview” 

capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting product development initiatives improving information technology systems and purchase of equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers capital expenditures totaled 113 million in 2019 and 112 million in 2018  excluding the impact of our pending disposition we expect capital spending to be between approximately 160 million and 170 million in 2020  though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance of equity the issuance and repayments of debt and commercial paper and payments of quarterly cash dividends to shareholders financing activities from continuing operations generated cash of 28 billion in 2019 compared to generating 879 million of cash in 2018  in 2019  we received proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes of 14 billion and received proceeds from the issuance of our 2020 delayeddraw term loan of 10 billion and our 2020 term loan of 500 million which was partially offset by the repayment of 400 million of our 2019 delayeddraw term loan and 55 million of our 180 senior unsecured notes during the year ended december 31 2019 we paid 163 million of cash dividends to common shareholders and holders of our mcps 

refer to “—liquidity and capital resources” section above for a description of our financing activities in 2019 and 2018  

we generally expect to satisfy any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by the revolving credit facility we classified our borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019  as we have the intent and ability as supported by availability under the revolving credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date as commercial paper obligations mature we may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 

the carrying value of total debt outstanding as of december 31 2019 was approximately 63 billion  we had 20 billion available under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  of this amount approximately 11 billion was being used to backstop outstanding us and euro commercial paper balances accordingly we had the ability to incur an additional 851 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness 

the availability of the revolving credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the commercial paper programs we expect to limit any borrowings under the revolving credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

as of december 31 2019  commercial paper outstanding under the us dollardenominated commercial paper program had an annual effective rate of 214 and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 13 days as of december 31 2019  commercial paper outstanding under the eurodenominated commercial paper program had an annual effective rate of 010 and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 33 days 

in 2018  we received net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs of 266 million  received proceeds from borrowings of 175 billion  repaid 185 billion of borrowings received proceeds from the issuance of convertible equity of 13 billion and paid 132 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

dividends 

on november 7 2019  we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007 per common share paid on december 27 2019 to holders of record on november 29 2019  in addition fortive announced that its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 1250 per share of its 500 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a payable on january 2 2020 to preferred stockholders of record on december 15 2019 the dividend to preferred shareholders was paid on december 31 2019  

aggregate cash payments for the dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended december 31 2019 were 163 million and were recorded as dividends to shareholders in the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows 

on january 28 2020 we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share payable on march 27 2020 to common stockholders of record on february 28 2020 and a regular quarterly cash dividend of 1250 per share on our mcps payable on april 1 2020 to preferred stockholders of record on march 15 2020 

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2019  we held approximately 12 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investmentgrade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an annual effective rate of approximately 10 substantially all of the cash was held outside of the us 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund our restructuring activities and pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs or objectives with respect to our cash requirements we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs we also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

conversely we have made an assertion regarding the amount of earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs local law restrictions high foreign remittance costs previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions or future growth needs t he tcja eliminated the us tax cost for qualified repatriation beginning in 2018 foreign cumulative earnings remain subject to foreign remittance taxes as a result of the tcja during 2018 we repatriated an estimated 275 million subject to no foreign remittance taxes this excludes foreign earnings 1 required as working capital for local operating needs 2 subject to local law restrictions 3 subject to high foreign remittance tax costs 4 previously invested in physical assets or acquisitions or 5 intended for future acquisitionsgrowth for most of our foreign operations we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment no provisions for foreign remittance taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely the amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings 

as of december 31 2019  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

during 2019  we contributed 11 million to our nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2020 our cash contribution requirements for our us and nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 1 million and 10 million  respectively the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 under 1 longterm debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 



  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our offbalance sheet commitments as of december 31 2019  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure our obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters we have not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and we cannot reasonably estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on our financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements we believe the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial statements 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or services or claims alleging that our products services or software infringe third party intellectual property we have not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

our restated certificate of incorporation requires us to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition we have executed with each of our directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which we have agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while we maintain insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in our portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires us to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net earnings the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from our trade accounts contract and financing receivable portfolios the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality we regularly perform detailed reviews of our accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate with a severity frequency andor timing different from our assumptions additional allowances would be required and our financial statements would be adversely impacted 

inventories  we record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation we estimate the net realizable 

value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the net realizable value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory which would adversely impact our financial statements refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

acquired intangibles  our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur refer to notes 2 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing our goodwill impairment testing we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach we estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses  in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

in 2019  we had twelve reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment we believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranged from 15 million to 38 billion  our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2019 indicated that in all instances the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge 

the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 5 to approximately 1300 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 5 to approximately 1200 we evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of the reporting units including as applicable results of the estimated fair value using an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and concluded no impairment charges were required 

we review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements if the reserves we established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we derive revenues from the sale of products and services on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our adoption of this asu 

if our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected historically our estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

stockbased compensation  for a description of our stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate given our limited trading history following the separation stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stock options in the postseparation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension and other post employment benefits  for a description of our pension accounting practices refer to note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements certain of our us and nonus employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors our financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans during 2019 would have increased the net obligation by 30 million 25 million on an aftertax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2019  

our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 150 to 60  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets during 2019 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense in 2019 would have increased by 1 million  1 million on an aftertax basis 

income taxes  for a description of our income tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

in accordance with gaap deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on our consolidated statements of earnings deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on our tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we evaluate the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate if we experience cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years we normally conclude that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise however if we experience cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the threeyear period including the current and prior two years we then consider a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized these factors include historical operating results known or planned operating developments the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities tax law carryback capability in the particular country and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies after evaluation of these factors if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country we would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required to the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction we establish a valuation allowance 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if in our assessment it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense 

in addition we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments see “results of operations  income taxes” and note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary 

an increase in our 2019 effective tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 of 9 million

the following discussion includes information common to both of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including electronic components steel plastics and other petroleumbased products cast iron aluminum and copper prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2018 we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to fortive 

competition 

we believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed applications expertise distribution channel access service and support technology and innovation breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve for example capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to oems are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in either of our reportable segments in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the following sets forth the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our segments as of december 31  in millions 



we expect that a majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2018 will be delivered to customers within two to three months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog in 2018 is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance backlog also includes the annual average contract value of signed contracts for our software as a service product offerings 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2018  we employed approximately 24000 persons of whom approximately 12500 were employed in the united states and approximately 11500 were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 800 were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils the company believes that its relationship with employees is good 

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2018 was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and governmentowned entities for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges and waste management and workplace health and safety for a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that our operations products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies please refer to note 16 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

exportimport compliance 

we are required to comply with various us exportimport control and economic sanctions laws such as 

 other nations’ governments have implemented similar exportimport control and economic sanction regulations which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions for a discussion of risks related to exportimport control and economic sanctions laws please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

international operations 

our products and services are available in markets worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the manner in which our products and services are sold outside the united states differs by business and by region most of our sales in nonus markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the united states though we also sell directly from the united states into nonus markets through various representatives and distributors and in some cases directly in countries with low sales volumes we generally sell through representatives and distributors 

major customers 

no customer accounted for more than 10 of consolidated sales in 2018  2017 or 2016  

available information 

we maintain an internet website at wwwfortivecom we make available free of charge on the website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with or furnishing such material to the sec our internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as market conditions economic conditions geopolitical events changes in laws regulations or accounting rules fluctuations in interest rates terrorism wars or conflicts major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business including our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

risks related to our business 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt changes in global trade policies volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment and underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures political and social instability natural disasters terrorist attacks and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect us and our distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 in addition adverse general economic conditions may lead to instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us or our lenders are unable to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations we may not be able to make certain investments or acquisitions or fully execute our business plans and strategies furthermore our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets if there is instability in global capital and credit markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets and product and economic cycles can affect 

the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

many of our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see the section entitled “businesscompetition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new or enhanced products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

changes in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment and electronic communications and market standardizations such as the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standard we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations and standards these regulations and standards are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change or delay in implementation in any of these regulations or standards or in the interpretation application or enforcement thereof could reduce or delay demand for our products and services increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations or implementation of industry standards on the timeline we expect in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or industry standards or the adoption of new regulations or industry standards which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines or industry standard implementation timelines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

trade relations between china and the united states could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

we have experienced growth in various end markets in china during 2018 yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew at a low doubledigit rate in china and sales in china accounted for approximately 9 of our total sales for the year ended december 31 2018  in addition we have numerous facilities in china many of which serve multiple businesses and are used for multiple purposes 

there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and china including with respect to trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs substantial changes to us foreign trade policy with respect to china have recently been implemented including imposition of greater restrictions on international trade the united states has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states from china following which the chinese government increased tariffs on certain goods imported into china from the united states there is a risk of further escalation and retaliatory actions between the two countries in addition the current administration certain members of congress and federal officials have stated that united states may seek to implement more protective trade measures not just with respect to china but with respect to other countries in the asia pacific region as well any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade especially trade with china could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our anticipated rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our anticipated rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates anticipated which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for 

acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 



 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations in addition some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous or energetic materials in the development manufacturing or servicing of our products we cannot assure you that our 

environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements moreover any accident that results in significant personal injury or property damage whether occurring during development manufacturing servicing use or storage of our products may result in significant production interruption delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damage harm to our reputation and reduction in morale among our employees any of which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 16 to the consolidated and combined financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and 

cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to the section entitled “businessregulatory matters” 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2018  approximately 45 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2018  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 86 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation 

effects in addition certain of our businesses may transact in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the transaction currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable exchange rate effects we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical source of earnings could materially impact our consolidated effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we operate could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition foreign remittance taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change then our income tax expense could increase on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cut and jobs act “tcja” the tcja represents one of the most significant overhauls to the us federal tax code since 1986 according to the sec the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses and introduces changes that impact us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits in addition pursuant to the interpretive guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 118 we prepared and recorded tax accounting for the year ended december 31 2017 applying tax laws in effect prior to the application of the provisions of the tcja and recorded provisional estimates for all the effects of the tcja with adjustments to the provisional estimates recorded in 2018 in addition further guidance regulations and technical corrections pertaining to tcja continue to be issued by the tax authorities including those with retroactive application we will continue to assess such new guidance regulations and corrections as they are issued however there can be no assurance that the retroactive applications of such new guidance regulations or corrections issued by the tax authorities will not result in revisions to our prior interpretation of the corresponding provisions of tcja that may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries the oecd has issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of which are being adopted by various countries in which we do business changes in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate 

we have incurred a significant amount of debt and our debt will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 34 billion of longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt on a consolidated basis we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 



our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our credit agreement include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the end of any fiscal quarter a consolidated net leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of less than 350 to 100 or for four consecutive quarters immediately following the consummation of any qualified acquisition less than 400 to 100 in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of greater than 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets that we were previously unable to estimate or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties and some of which are managed on a decentralized independent basis by our operating companies to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers nation states cybercriminals computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar incidents in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects impacting safety cybersecurity or quality issues or the perception of such issues for our products and services can lead to personal injury death property damage data loss or other damages these events could lead to recalls or safety or other public alerts result in product or service downtime or the temporary or permanent removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls downtime removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in the section entitled “businessmaterials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other 

commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have certain us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and 

shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation “restated certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws “amended and restated bylaws” contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors the “board” rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by the board these provisions include among others 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an “interested stockholder” shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board and by providing the board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 

however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

changes in us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with our company or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against our company and our directors and officers 

certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in danaher 

because of their current or former positions with danaher certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in danaher in addition certain of our directors are currently serving on the danaher board of directors continuing ownership of shares of danaher common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if we and danaher face decisions that could have implications for both danaher and us 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations 

in connection with the separation danaher undertook several corporate restructuring transactions which together with the separation may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these restructuring transactions or the separation 

 then the court could void the separation in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareholders to return to danaher some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution or require danaher or us as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the fair value of its liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as that debt matures

overview 

general 

fortive is a multinational business with global operations please see “item 1 business – general” included in this annual report for a discussion of the company’s strategies for delivering longterm shareholder value during 2018  approximately 45 of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified industrial growth company with global operations our businesses are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors our geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of our products software and services typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country except for the united states on our operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of opportunities and challenges including technological development in most of the markets we serve the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we define highgrowth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia with the exception of japan and australia we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from operations calculated according to gaap but excluding 1 sales impacts from acquired businesses 2 sales impacts from the separation and 3 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales or operating profit as applicable attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture sales impacts from the separation refer to sales to or from danaher made under agreements entered into or terminated in connection with the separation prior to the first anniversary of the separation the portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales from acquired businesses or the separation and b the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales from acquired businesses or the separation after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items including the impact of agreements with danaher that were entered into or terminated in connection with the separation because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers in addition we exclude the impact of agreements that were terminated or entered into in connection with the separation because we believe that excluding such impact may be useful to investors in assessing our operational performance independent of the impact on sales to or from danaher resulting primarily from the separation we exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisition and divestiture including separationrelated items and currency translation may facilitate assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of longterm performance references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among our businesses on an overall basis demand for our hardware and software products and services increased during 2018 as compared to 2017 resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth of 121 and sales growth from existing businesses of 41  our continued application and deployment of the fortive business system including investments in sales growth initiatives and new product introductions as well as increased demand in both highgrowth and developed markets and other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to overall sales growth from existing businesses 

on a yearoveryear basis sales growth from existing businesses in the professional instrumentation segment was driven by strong demand in the businesses within both advanced instrumentation  solutions and sensing technologies in our industrial technologies segment the liability shift related to enhanced credit card security requirements in the united states based on the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standards is continuing to drive demand within our transportation technologies businesses emv is expected to continue to drive increased demand for dispensers and payment systems in 2019 

geographically sales from existing businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate in both highgrowth and developed markets during 2018 as compared to 2017  yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate in north america and asia with low doubledigit rate growth in china while sales from existing businesses were flat in western europe 

we expect overall sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2019  however we continue to monitor developments from macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties including global uncertainties related to governmental policies toward international trade monetary and fiscal policies including the current uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and china with respect to trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs as well as other factors identified in “item 1a risk factors”

cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase in cost of sales during 2018 as compared to 2017 is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes from existing businesses incremental cost of sales from our recently acquired businesses and increased material costs associated primarily with inflationary pressures and recently enacted tariffs partly offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives and material cost and supply chain improvement actions changes in currency exchange rates increased costs of sales in 2018 

the yearoveryear increase in gross profit and the related 70 basis point increase in gross profit margin during 2018 as compared to 2017 is due primarily to the favorable impact of pricing improvements and higher yearoveryear sales volumes from existing businesses incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives  material cost and supply chain improvement actions and the impact of recently acquired businesses increased material costs associated primarily with inflationary pressures and recently enacted tariffs and changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset the factors described above

operating expenses 



sga expenses increased during 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to transaction costs associated with the announced acquisitions incremental yearoveryear depreciation and amortization from our businesses we acquired over the last two years continued investments in our sales and marketing growth initiatives and changes in foreign currency exchange rates these increases were partly offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives  sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased 230 basis points in 2018 as compared to 2017  

sga expenses increased during 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to continued investments in our sales and marketing growth initiatives increased acquisitionrelated transaction costs and increased general and administrative costs required to operate as a standalone public company as compared to the allocations derived from danaher in the periods prior to the separation which primarily impacted the first half of 2017 as compared to the first half of 2016 these increases were partly offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives and lower yearoveryear intangible asset amortization due to certain intangible assets primarily in our professional instrumentation segment being fully amortized sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased 80 basis points in 2017 as compared to 2016  

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs increased during 2018 as compared to 2017 due to incremental yearoveryear investments in our product development initiatives and expenses from businesses we acquired over the last two years on a yearoveryear basis rd expenses as a percentage of sales were flat as the investments in our product development initiatives grew at the same rate as sales 

rd expenses increased during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to incremental yearoveryear investments in our product development initiatives on a yearoveryear basis rd expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points due primarily to the impact of sales growing at a faster rate than rd expenses during the period 

interest costs 

for a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness refer to note 10 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

interest expense of 97 million was recorded during 2018 compared to 89 million during 2017 and 46 million during 2016 interest expense increased in 2018 due to higher average debt balances during the year in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities andor access the capital markets if we enter into such additional financing transactions the amount of annual interest expense will increase 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements we record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” the tcja represents a significant overhaul to the us federal tax code the tcja impacts among other things us 

corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits during 2018 the us treasury department issued significant initial guidance we have completed the accounting for all the impacts of the tcja based upon the proposed regulations and guidance already provided by federal authorities as of december 31 2018 

the us government is still issuing significant amounts of tcja guidance that we expect to continue into the foreseeable future on january 15 2019 treasury and the internal revenue service issued final treasury regulations under section 965 of the internal revenue code involving the onetime transition tax on international earnings these final treasury regulations are retroactive to the enactment of section 965 of the tcja on december 22 2017 the company is evaluating the impact of these final treasury regulations on the application of section 965 to the company’s unremitted international earnings any future adjustments resulting from guidance issued after december 31 2018 will be considered as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the interim period the guidance is issued 

the company continues to expect that the tcja will have a favorable impact on our financial statements for the foreseeable future and our future ability to engage in acquisition activities 

our effective tax rate can be affected by among others changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” initiative on base erosion and profit shifting 

the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines we have taken comprehensive measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy we do not expect these global tax policy changes to have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

we conduct business globally and as part of our global business we file numerous income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions after the tcja our ability to obtain a tax benefit in certain countries that continue to have a lower statutory tax rates than the united states is dependent on our levels of taxable income in such foreign countries we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments the company is subject to examination in the united states various states and foreign jurisdiction for the tax years 2008 to 2018 we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities in connection with the separation of fortive from danaher we entered into the agreements with danaher including a tax matters agreement the tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “joint” filings compared to “separate” filings prior to the separation “joint” filings involve legal entities such as those in the united states that include operations from both danaher and the company by contrast “separate” filings involve certain entities primarily outside of the united states that exclusively include either danaher’s or the company’s operations respectively in accordance with the tax matters agreement the company is liable for and has indemnified danaher against all income tax liabilities involving “separate” filings for the periods prior to the separation 

during 2018 the company entered into a tax matters agreement in connection with the splitoff of the as business the company remains liable for predisposition income tax liabilities related to the as business 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 

our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 was 148  176 and 267  respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2018 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the effect of the tcja us federal permanent differences the impact of credits and deductions provided by law earnings outside the united states that are 

indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and the effect of 2018 tcja adjustments to the 2017 provisional estimates in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 

our effective tax rate for 2017 including provisional estimates of the tcja differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due primarily to net favorable impacts associated with the tcja our earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate the impact of credits and deductions provided by law state tax impacts and favorable adjustments related to differences between estimates included in the 2016 provision and amounts calculated on the 2016 us income tax return filed in october 2017 

our effective tax rate for 2016 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due primarily to our earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and the impact of credits and deductions provided by law the effective tax rate for 2016 includes benefits from the release of reserves resulting from expirations of statutes of limitations primarily from periods prior to the separation 

for the period prior to the separation current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with danaher are assumed to be immediately settled with danaher and are relieved through former parent’s investment income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in the consolidated and combined financial statements are presented as if we filed a separate tax return the separate tax return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a standalone taxpayer for the periods prior to the separation the calculation of our income taxes on a separate income tax return basis requires considerable judgment estimates and allocations 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased by 161 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017  due to net earnings that were higher by 187 billion and unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 264 million  favorable pension benefit adjustments in 2018 were 4 million compared to favorable adjustments of 2 million in 2017  

comprehensive income increased by 442 million in 2017 as compared to 2016  due primarily to favorable changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 260 million and net earnings that were higher by 172 million  in addition we recorded favorable pension benefit adjustments of 2 million in 2017 compared to unfavorable adjustments of 8 million in 2016  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on our revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31 2018  2017 or 2016  

financial instruments and risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk and commodity prices each of which could impact our financial statements we generally address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities in addition our broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

we manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2018  an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 145 million  

as of december 31 2018  our variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper and term loan borrowings refer to note 10 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2018  as a result our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature we anticipate issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations and term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings the annual effective rate associated with our outstanding us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper and delayeddraw term loan and yen term loan for the year ended december 31 2018 was approximately 298  010  297 and 050  respectively and we recorded interest expense of 308 million on these variablerate obligations a hypothetical 10 basis points increase in market interest rates as of december 31 2018 on our variablerate debt obligations as of december 31 2018 would have increased our interest expense by 25 million in 2018  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary we also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of equity a 10 depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2018 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’s equity of approximately 191 million  

currency exchange rates positively impacted 2018 reported sales by 04 as compared to 2017  as the us dollar was on average weaker against most major currencies during 2018 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2017  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2018 were to prevail throughout 2019  currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2019 estimated sales by approximately 12 relative to our performance in 2018  in general additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact our sales and results of operations 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in our consolidated and combined financial statements 

credit risk 

we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and highlyliquid investment grade cash equivalents and receivables from customers we place cash and cash equivalents with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents we emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in existing businesses consummate strategic acquisitions make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and manage our capital structure on a short and longterm basis refer also to note 10 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information 

2018 financing and capital transactions 

during 2018 we completed the following financing and capital transactions 

 2017 financing transactions 

during 2017 we completed the following financing transactions 



2016 financing transactions 

during 2016 we completed the following financing transactions 

 approximately 30 billion of the net proceeds of these financings activities was paid to danaher in june 2016 as a cash dividend in connection with the separation refer to note 10 of the consolidated and combined financial statements for more information related to our longterm indebtedness 

in connection with the issuance of the private notes we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we were obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the sec and cause to be declared effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of private notes for registered notes “registered notes” with substantially identical terms “exchange offer” and on may 5 2017 we filed a form s4 with the sec the “registration statement” which registration statement was declared effective on may 17 2017 on may 17 2017 we launched the exchange offer which expired on june 14 2017 all private notes were tendered and exchanged for registered notes in the exchange offer 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity 



operating activities 

continuing operations cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 120 billion in 2018  an increase of 181 million  or approximately 18  as compared to 2017  this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately 102 billion in 2017  an increase of 38 million or approximately 4  as compared to 2016  this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was approximately 297 billion during 2018 compared to approximately 164 billion and 291 million of net cash used in 2017 and 2016  respectively for a discussion of our acquisitions refer to “—overview” 

capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting product development initiatives improving information technology systems and purchase of equipment that is used in operatingtype lease arrangements with customers capital expenditures totaled 112 million in 2018  111 million in 2017 and 110 million in 2016  the change in capital expenditures is due primarily to timing of investments and in 2017 increased yearoveryear expenditures on equipment which contribute to our recurring revenue base excluding the impact of our pending acquisition we expect capital spending to be between approximately 120 million and 130 million in 2019  though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of debt and commercial paper the issuance of shares of 50 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a “mcps” and payments of quarterly cash dividends to shareholders financing activities from continuing operations generated cash of 879 million in 2018 compared to 598 million of cash provided in 2017 and 2 million provided in 2016  in 2018  we received proceeds from the issuance of our mcps of 134 billion  received proceeds from borrowings with maturities greater than 90 days of 175 billion  repaid net 2661 million of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs and borrowings with maturities greater than 90 days of 185 billion  and paid 132 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

refer to —liquidity and capital resources section above for a description of our financing activities in 2018  2017 and 2016  

we generally expect to satisfy any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by the revolving credit facility we classified our borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018  as we have the intent and ability as supported by availability under the revolving credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date as commercial paper obligations mature we may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 

the carrying value of total debt outstanding as of december 31 2018 was approximately 34 billion  we had 20 billion available under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  of this amount approximately 660 million was being used to backstop outstanding us and euro commercial paper balances accordingly we had the ability to incur an additional 134 billion of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  refer to note 10 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness 

the availability of the revolving credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the commercial paper programs we expect to limit any borrowings under the revolving credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

as of december 31 2018  commercial paper outstanding under the us dollardenominated commercial paper program had an annual effective rate of 298 and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 18 days as of december 31 2018  commercial paper outstanding under the eurodenominated commercial paper program had an annual effective rate of 010 and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 58 days 

in 2017  we received net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs of 556 million  received proceeds from borrowings of 126 million and paid 97 million of cash dividends to shareholders 

in 2016  we incurred approximately 34 billion of indebtedness offset by 33 billion of payments and net transfers to former parent we no longer make any net transfers to former parent as a result of the separation 

dividends 

on november 8 2018  we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007 per common share paid on december 28 2018 to holders of record on november 30 2018  in addition fortive announced that its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 1250 per share of its 500 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a payable on january 2 2019 to preferred stockholders of record on december 15 2018 the dividend to preferred shareholders was paid on december 31 2018  

aggregate cash payments for the dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended december 31 2018 were 132 million and were recorded as dividends to shareholders in the consolidated and combined statements of changes in equity and the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows 

on january 29 2019 we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share payable on march 29 2019 to common stockholders of record on february 22 2019 and a regular quarterly cash dividend of 1250 per share on our mcps payable on april 1 2019 to preferred stockholders of record on march 15 2019 

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2018  we held approximately 118 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investmentgrade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an annual effective rate of approximately 10 substantially all of the cash was held outside of the united states 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund our restructuring activities and pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs or objectives with respect to our cash requirements we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs andor access the capital markets we also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

the tcja that was enacted in december 2017 is materially improving our us liquidity through lower corporate tax rates and enhanced cash repatriation during the year ended december 31 2018 we repatriated 275 million in connection with the tcja and these repatriations did not result in any foreign remittance taxes 

conversely we have made an assertion regarding the amount of earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs local law restrictions high foreign remittance costs previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions or future growth needs such earnings are intended for indefinite foreign reinvestment and no provision for nonus income taxes has been made the amount of income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the unknown duration of local law restrictions as applicable to such earnings unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the restriction periods and the various alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions we expect the tcja to have a favorable impact in our future ability to engage in acquisition activities 

as of december 31 2018  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

during 2018  we contributed 10 million to our nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2019 our cash contribution requirements for our nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 8 million  we do not expect to make contributions to the us plan during 2019  the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018 under 1 longterm debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 



  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our offbalance sheet commitments as of december 31 2018  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure our obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters we have not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and we cannot reasonably estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on our financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements we believe the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial statements 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or services or claims alleging that our products services or software infringe third party intellectual property we have not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

our restated certificate of incorporation requires us to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition we have executed with each of our directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which we have agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while we maintain insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 16 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

accounts receivable  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in our portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires us to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from our trade accounts contract and financing receivable portfolios the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality we regularly perform detailed reviews of our accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate with a severity 

frequency andor timing different from our assumptions additional allowances would be required and our financial statements would be adversely impacted 

inventories  we record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the net realizable value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory which would adversely impact our financial statements refer to note 5 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

acquired intangibles  our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur refer to notes 2 3 and 7 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing our goodwill impairment testing we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach we estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses  in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

in 2018  we had thirteen reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment we believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 15 million to 17 billion  our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2018 indicated that in all instances the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 0 to approximately 900 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 10 to approximately 800 after applying the hypothetical 10 decrease two reporting units representing recently acquired businesses had hypothetical fair values below their carrying value we evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of these reporting units including as applicable results of the estimated fair value using an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and we concluded no impairment charge was required 

we review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated and combined financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes 

the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated and combined financial statements if the reserves we established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we derive revenues from the sale of products and services on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance refer to note 12 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our adoption of this asu 

if our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected historically our estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

stockbased compensation  for a description of our stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 17 to our consolidated and combined financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate given our limited trading history following the separation stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stockbased payment awards in the postseparation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pensions  for a description of our pension accounting practices refer to note 11 to the consolidated and combined financial statements certain of our nonus employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors our financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans during 2018 would have increased the net obligation by 21 million  17 million on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2018  

our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 175 to 60  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets during 2018 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense in 2018 would have increased by 10 million  08 million on an aftertax basis 

income taxes  for a description of our income tax accounting policies refer to note 2 and note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized as such we make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on our financial statements 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if in our assessment it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of our tax returns are currently subject to review by tax authorities see “results of operations  income taxes” and note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements we believe the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in us being 

required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements including our effective tax rate 

an increase in our 2018 effective tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 of 11 million  

corporate allocations  prior to the separation we operated as part of danaher and not as a standalone company accordingly we had been allocated certain shared costs which are reflected as expenses in the combined financial statements for the period prior to the separation we consider the allocation methodologies used to be reasonable and appropriate reflections of the related expenses attributable to the company for purposes of the combined financial statements refer to note 20 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of the preseparation allocations from danaher and related party transactions 

new accounting standards 

for a discussion of new accounting standards relevant to our businesses refer to note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

separation from danaher 

in connection with the separation on july 1 2016 we entered into agreements that govern the separation and the relationships between the parties following the separation including an employee matters agreement a tax matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a danaher business system license agreement and a transition services agreement collectively the “agreements” 

prior to the separation on july 1 2016 we were dependent upon danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries with the exception of cash cash equivalents and borrowings clearly associated with fortive and related to the separation including the financial transactions described above financial transactions relating to our business operations during the period prior to the separation were accounted for through the former parent’s investment net “former parent’s investment” account accordingly none of our former parent’s cash cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level was assigned to us in the financial statements for the periods prior to the separation as a result of the separation we no longer participate in danaher’s cash management and financing operations 

the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements present our historical financial position results of operations changes in equity and cash flows in accordance with gaap the combined financial statements for the period prior to the separation were derived from danaher’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and prepared in accordance with gaap for the preparation of carvedout combined financial statements through the date of the separation all revenues and costs as well as assets and liabilities directly associated with fortive have been included in the combined financial statements prior to the separation the combined financial statements also included allocations of certain general administrative sales and marketing expenses and cost of sales from danaher’s corporate office and from other danaher businesses to the company and allocations of related assets liabilities and the former parent’s investment as applicable the allocations were determined on a reasonable basis however the amounts are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had the company been an entity that operated independently of danaher during the applicable periods related party allocations prior to the separation including the method for such allocation are discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

following the separation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of fortive and those of our whollyowned subsidiaries and no longer include any allocations from danaher 

prior to the separation these consolidated and combined financial statements may not be indicative of our results had we been a separate standalone entity throughout the periods presented nor are the results stated herein indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future

the following discussion includes information common to both of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including electronic components steel plastics and other petroleumbased products cast iron aluminum and copper prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2017  we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark 

copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to fortive 

competition 

we believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed applications expertise distribution channel access service and support technology and innovation breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve for example capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to oems are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in either of our reportable segments in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the following sets forth the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our segments as of december 31  in millions 



we expect that a majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2017  will be delivered to customers within three to four months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 26000  persons of whom approximately 13000  were employed in the united states and approximately 13000  were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1500  were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils the company believes that its relationship with employees is good 

research and development “rd” 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained and enhanced through the development and introduction of new products and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we conduct rd activities for the purpose of designing and developing new products and applications that address customer needs and emerging trends as well as enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products our rd efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology we expect to continue investing in rd at a rate consistent with our historical trends with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position and entering new markets the following sets forth our rd expenditures over each of the last three years ended december 31 by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 



we generally conduct rd activities on a businessbybusiness basis primarily in north america asia and europe we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for rd as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” customersponsored rd was not material in 2017  2016  or 2015  

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2017  was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and governmentowned entities for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

international operations 

our products and services are available in markets worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets

risks related to our business 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt changes in global trade policies volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment and underemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures political and social instability natural disasters terrorist attacks and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect us and our distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 in addition adverse general economic conditions may lead to instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us or our lenders are unable to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations we may not be able to make certain investments or acquisitions or fully execute our business plans and strategies furthermore our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets if there is instability in global capital and credit markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets and product and economic cycles can affect 

the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

many of our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see the section entitled “businesscompetition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new or enhanced products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

changes in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment and electronic communications and market standardizations such as the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standard we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations and standards these regulations and standards are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change or delay in implementation in any of these regulations or standards or in the interpretation application or enforcement thereof could reduce or delay demand for our products and services increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations or implementation of industry standards on the timeline we expect in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or industry standards or the adoption of new regulations or industry standards which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines or industry standard implementation timelines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our anticipated rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our anticipated rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates anticipated which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 



 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 



increase our expenses adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations 

 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations in addition some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous or energetic materials in the development manufacturing or servicing of our products we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements moreover any accident that results in significant personal injury or property damage whether occurring during development manufacturing servicing use or storage of our products may result in significant production interruption delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damage harm to our reputation and reduction in morale among our employees any of which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 14  to the consolidated and combined financial statements we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and 

financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to the section entitled “businessregulatory matters” 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2017  approximately 45  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 



 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2017  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 64 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may transact in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the transaction currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable exchange rate effects we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our effective tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate any changes in our geographical source of earnings could materially impact our consolidated effective tax rate furthermore a change in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we operate could result in a material increase in our tax expense in addition foreign remittance taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change then our income tax expense could increase on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cut and jobs act “tcja” the tcja represents one of the most significant overhauls to the us federal tax code since 1986 according to the sec the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses and introduces changes that impact us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits in addition pursuant to the interpretive guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 118 we prepared and recorded tax accounting for the year ended 

december 31 2017 applying tax laws in effect prior to the application of the provisions of the tcja and recorded provisional estimates for all the effects of the tcja as a result of any further guidance and regulations pertaining to tcja and as we complete our analysis the provisional estimates may be subject to adjustments which adjustments may have a material adverse effect on our financial results during the period in which such adjustments are determined 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” which represents a coalition of member countries the oecd has issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous longstanding tax principles many of which are being adopted by various countries in which we do business changes in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate 

we have incurred a significant amount of debt and our debt will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 41 billion  of longterm debt on a consolidated basis we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 

 our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our credit agreement include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the end of any fiscal quarter a consolidated net leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of less than 350 to 100 or for four consecutive quarters immediately following the consummation of any qualified acquisition less than 375 to 100 in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of greater than 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets that we were previously unable to estimate or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties and some of which are managed on a decentralized independent basis by our operating companies to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be 

damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers nation states cybercriminals computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar incidents in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects impacting safety cybersecurity or quality issues or the perception of such issues for our products and services can lead to personal injury death property damage data loss or other damages these events could lead to recalls or safety or other public alerts result in product or service downtime or the temporary or permanent removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls downtime removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in the section entitled “businessmaterials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could 

impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have certain us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation “restated certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws “amended and restated bylaws” contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors the “board” rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by the board these provisions include among others 



 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an “interested stockholder” shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board and by providing the board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 

however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

changes in us gaap could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with our company or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against our company and our directors and officers 

risks related to the separation 

potential indemnification liabilities to danaher pursuant to our separation agreement with danaher could materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our separation agreement with danaher among other things provides for indemnification obligations for uncapped amounts designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities whether incurred prior to or after the separation if we are required to indemnify danaher under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with the separation danaher has indemnified us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that danaher’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements with danaher danaher has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that danaher has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from danaher will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that danaher will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition danaher’s insurers may attempt to deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from danaher or such insurance providers any amounts for which we may be held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our businesses financial position results of operations and cash flows 

there could be significant liability if the separation fails to qualify as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes 

it was a condition to the distribution of all of our shares of common stock to the holders of danaher common stock in connection with the separation that danaher receive an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp tax counsel to danaher regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is taxfree to danaher and danaher’s shareholders for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of sections 355a and 368a1d of the code the opinion relied on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from danaher and us including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied danaher may not be able to rely on the opinion and danaher and its shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

under the tax matters agreement between danaher and us we are required to indemnify danaher against taxes incurred by danaher that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code under the tax matters agreement between danaher and us we may also be required to indemnify danaher for other contingent tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial position even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of danaher under the tax matters agreement we nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if danaher were to fail to pay them if we are required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law the amounts may be significant 

we may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for a twoyear period after the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes to danaher of the separation under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with danaher we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under the tax matters agreement until july 2 2018 we are subject to specific restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisition merger liquidation sale and stock redemption transactions with respect to our stock these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business these restrictions do not limit the acquisition of other businesses by us for cash consideration in addition under the tax matters agreement we may be required to indemnify danaher against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets even if it does not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition 

certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in danaher 

because of their current or former positions with danaher certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in danaher in addition certain of our directors are currently serving on the danaher board of directors continuing ownership of shares of danaher common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if we and danaher face decisions that could have implications for both danaher and us 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations 

in connection with the separation danaher undertook several corporate restructuring transactions which together with the separation may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these restructuring transactions or the separation 

 then the court could void the separation in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareholders to return to danaher some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution or require danaher or us as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the fair value of its liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as that debt matures

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

fortive is a diversified industrial growth company comprised of professional instrumentation and industrial technologies segments and encompassing businesses that are recognized leaders in attractive markets our wellknown brands hold leading positions in advanced instrumentation and solutions transportation technology sensing automation and specialty and franchise distribution markets our businesses design develop service manufacture and market professional and engineered products software and services for a variety of end markets building upon leading brand names innovative technology and significant market positions our research and development manufacturing sales distribution service and administrative facilities are located in more than 50  countries  across north america asia pacific europe and latin america  

this mda is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management our mda is divided into seven sections 



basis of presentation 

we completed the separation from danaher corporation on july 2 2016 the first day of our fiscal third quarter of 2016 before that date fortive was a whollyowned subsidiary of danaher and our businesses were comprised of certain danaher operating units danaher transfered these businesses to us prior to the separation the separation was completed in the form of a pro rata distribution by danaher to its stockholders of record on june 15 2016 of all of the outstanding shares of fortive held by danaher fortive was incorporated in the state of delaware on november 10 2015 in order to facilitate the separation 

in connection with the separation on july 1 2016 we entered into agreements that govern the separation and the relationships between the parties following the separation including an employee matters agreement a tax matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a danaher business system license agreement and a transition services agreement collectively the “agreements” 

the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements present our historical financial position results of operations changes in equity and cash flows in accordance with gaap the combined financial statements for periods prior to the separation were derived from danaher’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and prepared in accordance with gaap for the preparation of carvedout combined financial statements through the date of the separation all revenues and costs as well as assets and liabilities directly associated with fortive have been included in the combined financial statements prior to the separation the combined financial statements also included allocations of certain general administrative sales and marketing expenses and cost of sales from danaher’s corporate office and from other danaher businesses to the company and allocations of related assets liabilities and the former parent’s investment as applicable the allocations were determined on a reasonable basis however the amounts are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had the company been an entity that operated independently of danaher during the applicable periods  related party allocations prior to the separation including the method for such allocation are discussed further in note 18 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

following the separation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of fortive and those of our whollyowned subsidiaries and no longer include any allocations from danaher   

prior to the separation these consolidated and combined financial statements may not be indicative of our results had we been a separate standalone entity throughout the periods presented nor are the results stated herein indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future 

overview 

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” included in this annual report for a discussion of the company’s strategies for delivering longterm shareholder value fortive is a multinational business with global operations during 2017  approximately 45  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified industrial growth company with global operations our businesses are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors our geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of our products software and services typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country except for the united states on our operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of opportunities and challenges including technological development in most of the markets we serve the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we define highgrowth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia with the exception of japan and australia we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from operations calculated according to gaap but excluding 1 sales impacts from acquired businesses 2 sales impacts from the separation and 3 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales or operating profit as applicable attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture sales impacts from the separation refer to sales to or from danaher made under agreements entered into or terminated in connection with the separation prior to the first anniversary of the separation the portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales from acquired businesses or the separation and b the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales from acquired businesses or the separation after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and 

not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items including the impact of agreements with danaher that were entered into or terminated in connection with the separation because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers in addition we exclude the impact of agreements that were terminated or entered into in connection with the separation because we believe that excluding such impact may be useful to investors in assessing our operational performance independent of the impact on sales to or from danaher resulting primarily from the separation we exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisition and divestiture including separationrelated items and currency translation may facilitate assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of longterm performance references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among our businesses on an overall basis demand for our hardware and software products and services increased during 2017 as compared to 2016  resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth of 69  and sales growth from existing businesses of 45  our continued investments in sales growth initiatives and new product introductions as well as increased demand in highgrowth markets and stabilization of market conditions in developed markets and other businessspecific factors discussed below contributed to overall sales growth from existing businesses across the majority of our businesses in the period on a yearoveryear basis sales growth from existing businesses in the professional instrumentation segment was driven by strong demand in the businesses within both advanced instrumentation  solutions and sensing technologies yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses in the industrial technologies segment was led by increased demand in automation  specialty components and transportation technologies businesses driven by demand for industrial automation solutions and demand for dispensers and payment systems in the united states and europe the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standards are expected to continue to drive demand for dispensers and payment systems over the next several years however we do not expect it to be a significant component of yearoveryear growth during the first half of 2018 we will continue to closely monitor this market dynamic and customer behavior 

geographically sales from existing businesses grew at a lowsingle digit rate in developed markets and at a lowdouble digit rate in highgrowth markets during 2017  as compared to 2016  yearoveryear sales from existing businesses grew at a rate in the midteens in china at a midsingle digit rate in western europe and at a lowsingle digit rate in north america we expect overall sales from existing businesses to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2018  but remain cautious about challenges due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties including global uncertainties related to monetary fiscal and trade policies as well as other factors identified in “item 1a risk factors” 

acquisitions 

on october 19 2017 by a merger of fern merger sub inc a delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of fortive into landauer inc a delaware corporation “landauer” we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock for 6725 per share in cash for a total purchase price of approximately 770 million net of acquired cash the “landauer acquisition” landauer is a leading global provider of subscriptionbased technical and analytical readers to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure as well as a leading domestic provider of outsourced medical physics services landauer is headquartered in glenwood illinois and is now part of the professional instrumentation segment landauer generated annual revenues of approximately 143 million in 2016 we financed the landauer acquisition with available cash and proceeds from the issuance of us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper we preliminarily recorded approximately 514 million of goodwill related to the landauer acquisition 

in addition to the landauer acquisition during 2017  we acquired all the outstanding shares of common stock of industrial scientific corporation “isc” on august 25 2017 and the remaining 80 of orpak systems limited “orpak” on august 31 2017 in which we previously had an ownership interest for total consideration of 800 million  in cash net of cash acquired the acquisition of the remaining 80 interest also resulted in the revaluation of our prior interest and we recorded a gain from acquisition of 153 million the businesses  acquired complement  existing units of both our segments the aggregate annual sales of these   businesses  at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case  based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 246 million  we preliminarily recorded an aggregate of 521 million  of goodwill related to these acquisitions  

our 2017  earnings reflect the impact of additional pretax charges of approximately 12 million  associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory equipment and deferred revenue related to the acquisitions 

during 2016  we acquired three   businesses  for total consideration of 190 million  in cash net of cash acquired the businesses  acquired complement  existing units of both our segments the aggregate annual sales of these   businesses  at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case  based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 47 million  we recorded an aggregate of 113 million  of goodwill related to these acquisitions

components of sales growth 



2017  compared to 2016 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment contributed 06  to sales growth during 2017  as compared to 2016  and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s advanced instrumentation  solutions businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2017  as compared to 2016  yearoveryear sales from existing businesses of field solutions products and services grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2017  as compared to 2016  due to increased demand for industrial test equipment network tools and online conditionbased monitoring equipment yearoveryear sales from existing businesses of product realization solutions grew at a highsingle digit rate during 2017  driven primarily by continued growth in the semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets as well as increased demand for oscilloscopes and new product introductions but were partly offset by 

a decline in demand for design engineering and manufacturing services sales in the segment’s energetic materials business also contributed to growth during 2017  geographically demand from existing businesses increased on a yearoveryear basis in asia driving strong growth in highgrowth markets as well as in western europe and north america 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s sensing technologies businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2017  as compared to 2016  increased yearoveryear demand in the industrial end market was partly offset by lower demand in the medical end market geographically increases in demand on a yearoveryear basis were driven by growth in asia north america and western europe

2016  compared to 2015 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment contributed 05 to sales growth during 2016 as compared to 2015 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s advanced instrumentation  solutions businesses declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 the business continued to experience stabilization in demand during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half 2016 and reported increased demand from existing businesses in the second half of 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period geographically sales from existing businesses declined in the united states and latin america partly offset by increases in china and western europe demand for field solutions products and services declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 with yearoveryear sales declines during the first half of the year partly offset by yearoveryear sales growth during the second half of 2016 during 2016 yearoveryear demand increased for online conditionbased monitoring equipment and network tools as well as for thermography equipment in china while demand decreased for calibration and biomedical equipment on a yearoveryear basis industrial product sales for field solutions products and services declined during 2016 but grew during the second half of 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 reflecting a stabilization in end customer demand yearoveryear sales of product realization services and products declined at a midsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 declines in some major product realization product lines were partly offset by growth in education and defenserelated end markets and semiconductor and communications end markets in china as well as increased demand for precision electrical measurement products and video network monitoring products demand for design engineering and manufacturing services increased on a yearoveryear basis but slowed during the second half of 2016 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s sensing technologies businesses declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 demand in these businesses continued to stabilize throughout the year and delivered highsingle digit growth on a yearoveryear basis during the fourth quarter of 2016 sales declines during 2016 for control products were partially offset by increased sales of sensing products primarily in the food and beverage medical equipment and heating and air conditioning endmarkets geographically sales from existing businesses decreased on a yearoveryear basis in north america partly offset by improved demand in asia 

operating profit margins decreased 120 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015 the following factors unfavorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons

components of sales growth 



2017  compared to 2016 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment contributed 02  to sales growth during 2017  as compared to 2016  and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s transportation technologies businesses grew at a lowsingle digit rate during 2017  as compared to 2016  due primarily to strong demand for dispensers and payment systems in both the united states and europe partly offset by decreased yearoveryear emvrelated demand for indoor pointofsale systems in the united states as customers had largely upgraded to products that support indoor emv requirements in the prior year in response to the indoor liability shift we expect emv deadlines to continue to drive demand for the next several years however we do not expect this to be a significant component of yearoveryear growth during the first half of 2018 we will continue to closely monitor this market dynamic and customer behavior geographically sales from existing businesses increased on a yearoveryear basis in europe latin america and the united states partially offset by declines in the asiapacific region 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation  specialty components businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2017  as compared to 2016  due primarily to increased yearoveryear demand in industrial and robotics end markets in china western europe and the united states yearoveryear demand for engine retarder products was strong in china and demand in the united states improved sequentially throughout the year 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s franchise distribution businesses grew at a lowsingle digit rate during 2017  as compared to 2016  increased yearoveryear demand for hardline and diagnostic tools was partially offset by a decline in demand for powered and tool storage products

2016  compared to 2015 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment contributed 03 to sales growth during 2016 as compared to 2015 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s transportation technologies businesses grew at a highsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to strong demand for dispenser payment and pointofsale systems environmental compliance products as well as vehicle and fleet management products partly offset by weaker yearoveryear demand for compressed natural gas products as expected beginning in the second half of 2016 the business began to experience reduced emvrelated demand for indoor pointofsale solutions as customers had largely upgraded to products that support indoor emv requirements in the prior year in response to the indoor liability shift however demand increased on a yearoveryear basis for dispensers and payment systems as customers in the united states continued to upgrade equipment driven primarily by the emv deadlines related to outdoor payment systems geographically sales from existing businesses continued to increase on a yearoveryear basis in the united states and to a lesser extent in asia and western europe 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation  specialty components business declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 the businesses experienced sequential yearoveryear improvement in demand during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016 during 2016 yearoveryear demand declined for engine retarder products due primarily to weakness in the north american heavytruck market partly offset by strong growth in china and europe in addition yearoveryear demand declined in certain medical and defense related end markets which were partly offset by increased yearoveryear demand for industrial automation products particularly in china geographically sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation  specialty components businesses declined in north america partly offset by growth in western europe and china 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s franchise distribution business grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to continued net increases in franchisees as well as continued growth in demand for professional tool products and tool storage products primarily in the united states this growth was partly offset by yearoveryear declines in wheel service equipment sales during 2016 

operating profit margins increased 70 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015 the following factors favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 



cost of sales and gross profit 



the yearoveryear increase  in cost of sales during 2017 as compared to 2016  is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes and changes in currency exchange rates partly offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings 

associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives  material cost and supply chain improvement actions and costs associated with various growth investments made in 2016 

the yearoveryear increase  in cost of sales during 2016  as compared to 2015  is due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various growth investments and restructuring actions partly offset by the effect of a strong us dollar and the incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and continued productivity material cost and supply chain improvement actions 

the yearoveryear increase  in gross profit and the related 90  basis point increase  in gross profit margin during 2017 as compared to 2016  is due primarily to the favorable impact of pricing improvements and higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives  material cost and supply chain improvement actions and costs associated with various growth investments made in 2016 and changes in currency exchange rates 

the yearover year increase  in gross profit and the related 10 basis point increase in gross profit margin during 2016 as compared to 2015  is due primarily to the favorable impact of pricing improvements and higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring actions continued productivity and material cost and supply chain improvement actions partly offset by incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various growth investments and higher yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions 

operating expenses 



sga expenses increased  during 2017 as compared to 2016  due primarily to continued investments in our sales and marketing growth initiatives increased acquisitionrelated transaction costs and increased general and administrative costs required to operate as a standalone public company as compared to the allocations derived from danaher in periods prior to the separation which primarily impacted the first half of 2017 as compared to the first half of 2016 these increases were partly offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives  and lower yearoveryear intangible asset amortization due to certain intangible assets primarily in our professional instrumentation segment being fully amortized  sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased   60  basis points in 2017 as compared to 2016  

sga expenses increased during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to the increased general and administrative costs required to operate as a standalone public company as compared to the allocations derived from danaher in periods prior to the separation continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions partly offset by incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives and the incrementally favorable impact of yearoveryear impairment charges recorded during 2016 and 2015 related to certain tradenames used in the industrial technologies segment sga expense as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015 

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs increased  during 2017 as compared to 2016  due to incremental yearoveryear investments in our product development initiatives on a yearoveryear basis rd expenses as a percentage of sales decreased   10  basis points due primarily to the impact of sales growing at a faster rate than rd expenses during the period rd expenses as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in 2016 as compared to 2015 incremental yearoveryear increases in investments in our product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase 

interest costs 

for a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness refer to note 9  to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

interest expense of 94 million  was recorded during 2017  compared to 49 million  during 2016  before the separation we depended on danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash 

management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries and as such did not have any outstanding debt prior to june 20 2016 as a result with the exception of cash cash equivalents and borrowings clearly associated with fortive and related to the separation we recorded no interest expense in our combined condensed financial statements for periods prior to the separation in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities andor access the capital markets if we enter into such additional financing transactions the amount of annual interest expense will increase 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements we record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax reform commonly referred to as the tax cut and jobs act the “tcja” the tcja represents a significant overhaul to the us federal tax code the tcja impacts among other things us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits the tcja is expected to have a favorable impact on our financial statements for the foreseeable future in addition we expect the tcja to have a favorable impact in our future ability to engage in acquisition activities 

our effective tax rate can be affected by among others changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” initiative on base erosion and profit shifting 

the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines a number of the expanded reporting requirements were initially due in 2017 based upon 2016 results and we have taken comprehensive measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy we do not expect these global tax policy changes to have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows the majority of our operations are located in the us 

we conduct business globally and as part of our global business we file numerous income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions the countries in which we have a significant presence that have had lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china germany and the united kingdom our ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states is dependent on our levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and under current us tax law we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income 

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities in connection with the separation we entered into the agreements with danaher including a tax matters agreement the tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “joint” filings compared to “separate” filings prior to the separation “joint” filings involve legal entities such as those in the united states that include operations from both danaher and the company by contrast “separate” filings involve certain entities primarily outside of the united states that exclusively include either danaher’s or the company’s operations respectively in accordance with the tax matters agreement danaher is liable for and has indemnified fortive against all income tax liabilities involving “joint” filings for periods prior to the separation the company remains liable for certain preseparation income tax liabilities including those related to the company’s “separate” filings 

pursuant to us tax law the company’s initial us federal income tax return was filed during october 2017 for the short taxable year july 2 2016 through december 31 2016 we expect to file our first full year us federal income tax return for 

2017 with the  irs during october 2018 the irs has not yet begun an examination of the company our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions remain subject to routine examination for tax years 2008 to 2017 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015 

our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 187  271  and 320  respectively 

our estimated effective tax rate including provisional estimates of the tcja for 2017 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due primarily to net favorable impacts associated with the tcja our earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate the impact of credits and deductions provided by law state tax impacts and favorable adjustments related to differences between estimates included in the 2016 provision and amounts calculated on the 2016 us income tax return filed in october 2017    

our effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 differ from the us federal statutory rate of 350 due primarily to our earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and the impact of credits and deductions provided by law the effective tax rate for 2016 includes benefits from the release of reserves resulting from expirations of statutes of limitations primarily from periods prior to the separation 

for periods prior to the separation current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with danaher are assumed to be immediately settled with danaher and are relieved through former parent’s investment income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in the consolidated and combined financial statements are presented as if we filed a separate tax return the separate tax return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a standalone taxpayer for the periods prior to the separation the calculation of our income taxes on a separate income tax return basis requires considerable judgment estimates and allocations 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income increased  by 442 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  due primarily to favorable  changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 260 million  and net earnings that were higher  by 172 million  in addition we recorded favorable  pension benefit adjustments of 2 million  in 2017  compared to unfavorable adjustments of 8 million  in 2016  

comprehensive income decreased  by 9 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  due primarily to unfavorable  pension benefit adjustments of 8 million  in 2016  compared to favorable  pension benefit adjustments of 18 million  in 2015  partially offset by net earnings that were higher  by 9 million  and favorable  changes in foreign currency translation adjustments of 8 million  

inflation 

the effect of inflation on our revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31   2017  2016  or 2015

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk and commodity prices each of which could impact our financial statements we generally address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities in addition our broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

we manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2017  an increase of 100  basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 176 million  

as of december 31 2017  our variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper and term loan borrowings refer to note 9  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2017  as a result our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature we anticipate issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations and term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings the annual effective rate associated with outstanding us dollar term loan borrowings and us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper for the year ended december 31 2017  was approximately 224  147  and 006  respectively for the period during which the 

yen term loan borrowings were outstanding during 2017 the annual effective rate was approximately 050  in addition we recorded interest expense of 157 million  on these variablerate obligations a hypothetical 15 basis points  increase in market interest rates as of december 31 2017  on our variablerate debt obligations would have increased our interest expense by 53 million  in 2017  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary we also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of equity a 10  depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2017  would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’s equity of approximately 204 million  

currency exchange rates positively impacted 2017  reported sales by 03  as compared to 2016  as the us dollar was on average stronger against most major currencies during 2017  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2016  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2017  were to prevail throughout 2018  currency exchange rates would positively  impact 2018  estimated sales by approximately 14  relative to our performance in 2017  in general additional weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact our sales and results of operations 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in our consolidated and combined financial statements 

credit risk 

we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments and receivables from customers we place cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents we emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in existing businesses consummate strategic acquisitions make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and manage our capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

yen variable interest rate term loan 

on august 24 2017 we entered into a term loan agreement that provides for a five year ¥138 billion  senior unsecured term facility “yen term loan” that expires on august 24 2022 we borrowed the entire ¥138 billion  available under this facility on august 28 2017 which yielded net proceeds of approximately 126 million  the yen term loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 50 basis points provided however that libor may not be less than zero for the purposes of the yen term loan as of december 31 2017  borrowings under the yen term loan bear an interest rate of 050  per annum during the period of 2017  in which the yen term loan was outstanding the annual effective rate was approximately 050  the yen term loan is prepayable at our option and reborrowing is not permitted once the term loan is repaid 

the terms and conditions including covenants applicable to the the yen term loan are substantially similar to those applicable to the senior unsecured revolving credit facility established in 2016 the “revolving credit facility” as described in note 9  of the consolidated and combined financial statements 

shelf registration statement 

on june 12 2017 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec the “shelf registration statement” that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities common stock preferred stock warrants depositary shares purchase contracts and units that may be issued in the future in one or more offerings unless otherwise specified in the corresponding prospectus supplement we expect to use net proceeds realized from future securities issuances off the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations acquisitions capital expenditures dividends and working capital 

2016 financing transactions 

during 2016 we completed the following financing transactions 

 approximately 30 billion  of the net proceeds of these financings activities was paid to danaher in june 2016 as a cash dividend in connection with the separation refer to note 9  of the consolidated and combined financial statements for more information related to our longterm indebtedness 

registration rights agreement 

in connection with the issuance of the private notes we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we were obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the sec and cause to be declared effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of private notes for registered notes “registered notes” with substantially identical terms “exchange offer” accordingly on may 5 2017 we filed a form s4 with the sec the “registration statement” which registration statement was declared effective on may 17 2017 on may 17 2017 we launched the exchange offer which expired on june 14 2017 all private notes were tendered and exchanged for registered notes in the exchange offer 

other 

prior to the separation we were dependent upon danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries with the exception of cash cash equivalents and borrowings clearly associated with fortive and related to the separation including the financial transactions described above financial transactions relating to our business operations during the period prior to the separation were accounted for through the former parent’s investment net “former parent’s investment” account accordingly none of our former parent’s cash cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level was assigned to us in the financial statements for the periods prior to the separation as a result of the separation we no longer participate in danaher’s cash management and financing operations 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

cash flows from operations were approximately 1176 million  in 2017  an increase  of 40 million  or approximately 3  as compared to 2016  this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors 



cash flows from operations increased 128 million  during 2016  as compared to 2015  this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities was approximately 1670 million  during 2017  compared to approximately 311 million  and 174 million  of net cash used in 2016  and 2015  respectively for a discussion of our acquisitions refer to “—overview” 

capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting product development initiatives improving information technology systems and purchase of equipment that is used in operatingtype lease arrangements with customers capital expenditures totaled 136 million  in 2017  130 million  in 2016  and 120 million  in 2015  the change in capital expenditures is due primarily to timing of investments and in 2017 increased yearoveryear expenditures on equipment leased to customers under operatingtype leases which contribute to our recurring revenue base in 2018  we expect capital spending to be between approximately 125 million and 135 million though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and other debt payments of quarterly cash dividends to shareholders and prior to the separation net payments and transfers to former parent financing activities generated  cash of 600 million  in 2017  compared to approximately 4 million  of cash provided in 2016  in 2017  we received net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs of 558 million  received proceeds from borrowings of 126 million  and paid 97 million  of cash dividends to shareholders in 2016  we incurred approximately 34 billion of indebtedness offset by 33 billion of payments and net transfers to former parent we no longer make any net transfers to former parent as a result of the separation 

we generally expect to satisfy any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by the revolving credit facility we classified our borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  as we have the intent and ability as supported by availability under the revolving credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date as commercial paper obligations mature we may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 

the carrying value of total debt outstanding as of december 31 2017 was approximately 41 billion  we had 15 billion available under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  of this amount approximately 948 million  was being used to backstop outstanding us and euro commercial paper balances accordingly we had the ability to incur an additional 551 million  of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  refer to note 9 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness 

the availability of the revolving credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the commercial paper programs we expect to limit any borrowings under the revolving credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

as of december 31 2017  commercial paper outstanding under the us dollardenominated commercial paper program had an annual effective rate of 174 and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 23  days as of december 31 2017  commercial paper outstanding under the eurodenominated commercial paper program had an annual effective rate of 008   and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 32  days 

net cash provided by financing activities was 4 million  in 2016  as compared to using 835 million  in 2015  due primarily to our incurrence of approximately 34 billion of indebtedness in 2016 as described above offset by the 30 billion dividend paid to danaher in connection with the separation in addition yearoveryear net transfers to former parent decreased by approximately 534 million 

dividends 

on november 2 2017  we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007  per share paid on december 29 2017 to holders of record on november 24 2017  aggregate cash payments for the dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended december 31 2017 were 972 million  and were recorded as dividends to shareholders in the consolidated and combined statements of changes in equity and the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows 

on january 23 2018 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007  per share payable on march 29 2018 to holders of record on february 23 2018 

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2017  we held approximately 9621 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investmentgrade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an annual effective rate of less than 10 substantially all of the cash was held outside of the united states 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund our restructuring activities and pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs or objectives with respect to our cash requirements we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs andor access the capital markets we also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

the tcja that was enacted in december 2017 is expected to materially improve our us liquidity through lower corporate tax rates and enhanced cash repatriation the tcja eliminated the us tax cost for qualified repatriation beginning in 2018 pre2018 foreign cumulative earnings remain subject to foreign remittance taxes as a result of the tcja we expect to repatriate an estimated 275 million  subject to an estimated 6 million  in foreign remittance taxes this excludes foreign earnings 1 required as working capital for local operating needs 2 subject to local law restrictions 3 subject to high foreign remittance tax costs 4 previously invested in physical assets or acquisitions or 5 intended for future acquisitionsgrowth we expect to apply this same approach to posttcja incremental foreign cash balances beginning in 2018 

as of december 31 2017  we recorded a current liability for the funds we have or intend to repatriate under the tcja final transition tax conversely we have made an election regarding the amount of earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs local law restrictions high foreign remittance costs previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions or future growth needs such earnings are intended for indefinite foreign reinvestment and no provision for nonus income taxes has been made the amount of income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the unknown duration of local law restrictions as applicable to such earnings unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the restriction periods and the various alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions we expect the tcja to have a favorable impact in our future ability to engage in acquisition activities 

as of december 31 2017  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

during 2017  we contributed 11 million  to our nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2018 our cash contribution requirements for our nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 10 million  we do not expect to make contributions to the us plan during 2018  the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

until the separation we were dependent upon danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries because we were part of 

danaher for the periods prior to separation no cash cash equivalents and borrowings were included in the consolidated and combined financial statements at december 31 2015 for all periods prior to the separation other financial transactions relating to our business operations were accounted for through the former parent’s investment account 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  under 1 longterm debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 



  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our offbalance sheet commitments as of december 31 2017  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure our obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters we have not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and we cannot reasonably estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on our financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements we believe the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial statements 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or services or claims alleging that our products services or software infringe third party intellectual property we have not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

our restated certificate of incorporation requires us to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition we have executed with each of our directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which we have agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while we maintain insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 14  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies please refer to “item 1a risk factor” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to 

period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 2  to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

accounts receivable  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in our portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires us to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from our trade accounts contract and financing receivable portfolios the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality we regularly perform detailed reviews of our accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate with a severity frequency andor timing different from our assumptions additional allowances would be required and our financial statements would be adversely impacted 

inventories  we record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the net realizable value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory which would adversely impact our financial statements refer to note 4  to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

acquired intangibles  our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur refer to notes 2 3 and 6 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing our goodwill impairment testing we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach we estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses  in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach  the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

in 2017  we had thirteen  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment we believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 7 million  to 11 billion  our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2017  indicated that in all instances the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 0 to approximately 1200 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 10 to approximately 1060 after applying the hypothetical 10 decrease only one reporting unit’s hypothetical fair value was below its carrying value we evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of this reporting unit including as applicable results of the estimated fair value using an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and we concluded no impairment charge was required 

we review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the 

carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 14  to the consolidated and combined financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 14  to the consolidated and combined financial statements if the reserves we established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we derive revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 2  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 

although most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element we allocate revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require us to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable our estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements 

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers   topic 606  which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance refer to ‘new accounting standards’ in note 2  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our adoption of this asu 

if our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected historically our estimates of revenue have been materially correct 

corporate allocations  prior to the separation we operated as part of danaher and not as a standalone company accordingly we had been allocated certain shared costs which are reflected as expenses in the combined financial statements for the periods prior to the separation we consider the allocation methodologies used to be reasonable and appropriate reflections of the related expenses attributable to the company for purposes of the combined financial statements refer to note 18  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of the preseparation allocations from danaher and related party transactions 

stockbased compensation  for a description of our stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 15  to our consolidated and combined financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate given our limited trading history following the separation stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stockbased payment awards in the postseparation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension  for a description of our pension accounting practices refer to note 10  to the consolidated and combined financial statements certain of our nonus employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors our financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the 

discount rates used for the plans during 2017  would have increased the net obligation by 27 million   21 million  on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2017  

our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 18  to 60  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets during 2017  was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense in 2017  would have increased by 10 million   08 million  on an aftertax basis 

income taxes  for a description of our income tax accounting policies refer to notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

on december 22 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” that provides guidance on the financial statement implications of the tcja pursuant to sab 118 interpretive guidance we prepared and recorded tax accounting for the year ended december 31 2017 applying tax laws in effect prior to the application of the provisions of the tcja and we also recorded provisional estimates as defined in sab 118 for all the effects of the tcja elections have been made on accounting policies and practices related to the tcja except  that we are evaluating the accounting treatment related to the new tcja global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” rules in our financial statements and have not yet made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes    sab 118 provides for a oneyear measurement period and we intend to complete the accounting for the tcja impacts within that time frame as of december 31 2017 we have not recorded any measurement period adjustments 

we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized as such we make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on our financial statements 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if in our assessment it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of our tax returns are currently subject to review by tax authorities see “—results of operations – income taxes” and note 11  to the consolidated and combined financial statements we believe the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in us being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements including our effective tax rate 

an increase in our 2017  effective tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017  of 13 million

the following discussion includes information common to both of our segments 

materials 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials including steel copper cast iron electronic components aluminum plastics and other petroleumbased products prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities we purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources during 2016 we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business for a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

intellectual property 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations we do not consider any single patent trademark copyright trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole from time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property please refer to “item 1a risk factors” all capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to fortive 

competition 

we believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product and service line our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality performance delivery speed applications expertise distribution channel access service and support technology and innovation breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition for a discussion of risks related to competition please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

seasonal nature of business 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve for example capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to oems are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products however as a whole we are not subject to material seasonality 

working capital 

we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs there are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items in either of our reportable segments in addition our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors 

backlog 

the following sets forth the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our segments as of december 31  in millions 



we expect that a majority of the unfilled orders as of december 31 2016 will be delivered to customers within three to four months of such date given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles we believe that backlog is indicative of shortterm revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or longterm revenue performance 

employee relations 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 24000  persons of whom approximately 12000  were employed in the united states and approximately 12000  were employed outside of the united states of our united states employees approximately 1500  were hourlyrated unionized employees outside the united states we have governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries particularly in europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions andor works councils the company believes that its relationship with employees is good 

research and development “rd” 

we believe that our competitive position is maintained and enhanced through the development and introduction of new products and services that incorporate improved features and functionality better performance smaller size and weight lower cost or some combination of these factors we invest substantially in the development of new products we conduct rd activities for the purpose of designing and developing new products and applications that address customer needs and emerging trends as well as enhancing the functionality effectiveness ease of use and reliability of our existing products our rd efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology we expect to continue investing in rd at a rate consistent with our historical trends with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position and entering new markets the following sets forth our rd expenditures over each of the last three years ended december 31 by segment and in the aggregate  in millions 



we generally conduct rd activities on a businessbybusiness basis primarily in north america asia and europe we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for rd as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position for a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” customersponsored rd was not material in 2016  2015  or 2014  

government contracts 

although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2016 was from customers other than governmental entities each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and governmentowned entities for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

regulatory matters 

we face extensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors”

international operations 

our products and services are available worldwide and our principal markets outside the united states are in europe and asia we also have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce provides greater stability to our operations allows us to drive economies of scale provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products in addition we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target highgrowth markets 

the table below describes annual revenue derived from customers outside the united states as a percentage of total annual revenue for the year ended december 31 by segment and in the aggregate based on geographic destination

risks related to our business 

conditions in the global economy the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower global economic growth actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt changes in global trade policies volatility in the currency and credit markets high levels of unemployment reduced levels of capital expenditures changes in government fiscal and monetary policies government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics sequestration other austerity measures political and social instability and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect us and our distributors customers and suppliers including having the effect of 

 there can be no assurances that the capital markets will be available to us or that our lenders will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality 

our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services which could adversely affect our financial statements certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic cyclical downturns in addition in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets and product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns which may be affected by announced price changes changes in incentive programs new product introductions and customer inventory levels any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services 

many of our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve we encounter a wide variety of competitors please see the section entitled “businesscompetition” for additional details in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses 

changes in industry standards and governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses 

we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulations such as regulations governing health and safety the environment and electronic communications and market standardizations such as the europay mastercard and visa “emv” global standard we develop configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations and standards these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions any significant change or delay in implementation in any of these regulations or in the interpretation application or enforcement thereof could reduce demand for increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services or could restrict our existing activities products and services in addition in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations or implementation of industry standards on the timeline we expect in these markets the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations or industry standards or the adoption of new regulations or industry standards which our products and services are not positioned to address could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadlines or industry standard implementation timeline may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period 

any inability to consummate acquisitions at our anticipated rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price 

our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our anticipated rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates anticipated which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms in addition competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to 



 in addition if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our profitability even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer 

our reputation ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that would violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

our acquisition of businesses joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter other strategic relationships in the ordinary course some of which may be material please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “mda” for additional details these acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our financial statements 



 the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities 

certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it in most of these agreements however the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements 

we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied in addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management and disputes may arise with buyers in addition we have retained responsibility for andor have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 

our operations products and services expose us to the risk of environmental health and safety liabilities costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements 

our operations products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use generation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations in addition some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous or energetic materials in the development manufacturing or servicing of our products we cannot assure you that our environmental health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements moreover any accident that results in significant personal injury or property damage whether occurring during development manufacturing servicing use or storage of our products may result in significant production interruption delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damages harm to our reputation and reduction in morale among our employees any of which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations 

in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we may also become subject to additional remedial compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations changes in agency direction or enforcement policies developments in remediation technologies changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules for additional information regarding these risks please refer to note 15  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

our businesses are subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

in addition to the environmental health safety anticorruption and other regulations noted above our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by us and nonus governmental and selfregulatory entities at the supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional levels including the following 

 these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions we our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review andor investigation by regulatory authorities failure to comply or any alleged or perceived failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and any such failure or alleged failure or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation could also damage our reputation disrupt our business limit our ability to manufacture import export and sell products and services result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategies for growing our business our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements for additional information regarding these risks please refer to the section entitled “businessregulatory matters” 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements 

in 2016  approximately 44  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states in addition many of our manufacturing operations suppliers and employees are located outside the united states since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the united states particularly in highgrowth markets our international business and particularly our business in highgrowth markets is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 



 any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets 

as of december 31 2016  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 47 billion  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets changes in the structure of our business divestitures market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements 

sales and purchases in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements increased strength of the us dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in us dollars into other countries which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices decreased strength of the us dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials products and services we purchase overseas sales and expenses of our nonus businesses are also translated into us dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects in addition certain of our businesses may transact in a currency other than the business’ functional currency and movements in the transaction currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable exchange rate effects we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability in addition audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various nonus jurisdictions the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period in addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently reinvested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate in addition any significant change to the tax system in the united states or in other jurisdictions including changes in the taxation of international income could adversely affect our financial statements 

we have incurred a significant amount of debt and our debt will increase further if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 34 billion  of longterm debt on a consolidated basis we may also obtain additional longterm debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including 



 our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations if we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions capital expenditures or research and development expenditures we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

additionally the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by among other limitations limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness make investments create liens sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates the covenants in our credit agreement include a debttoebitda ratio specifically the credit agreement requires us to maintain as of the end of any fiscal quarter a consolidated net leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of less than 350 to 100 or for four consecutive quarters immediately following the consummation of any qualified acquisition less than 375 to 100 in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of greater than 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter 

our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date also an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements 

we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters employment matters tax matters commercial disputes competition and sales and trading practices environmental matters personal injury insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiturerelated matters as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from or representations warranties or indemnities provided in connection with divested businesses these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages punitive and consequential damages andor injunctive relief the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements moreover any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses in addition developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements record estimates for liabilities or assets that we were previously unable to estimate or pay cash settlements or judgments any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation 

if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated 

circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements 

third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

from time to time we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our rights to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial statements 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products including software or services could adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements 

manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from third parties can lead to personal injury death property damage or other liability these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome can result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services 

adverse changes in our relationships with or the financial condition performance purchasing patterns or inventory levels of key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements 

certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and endusers some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners or adverse developments in their financial condition performance or purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial statements the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners and changes in those levels can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability 

our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations 

as discussed in the section entitled “businessmaterials” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components raw materials and other commodities prices for and availability of these components raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve the costcontainment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services could cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors could result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies 

because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability 

a significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

we rely on information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties and some of which are managed in a decentralized independent basis by our operating companies to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers and other business partners and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities these systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in addition security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers like many multinational corporations our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

our restructuring actions could have longterm adverse effects on our business 

in recent years we have implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses reduce our available talent assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases in addition delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements 

work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations 

we have certain us collective bargaining units and various nonus collective labor arrangements we are subject to potential work stoppages union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes any of which could adversely impact our productivity results of operations and reputation 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation “restated certificate of incorporation” and amended and restated bylaws “amended and restated bylaws” contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors the “board” rather than to attempt an unsolicited takeover not approved by the board these provisions include among others 

 in addition because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation an “interested stockholder” shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless i prior to such time the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder ii upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan or iii on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board and by providing the board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 

however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that the board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board otherwise determines the state courts in the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our shareholders any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against our company or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with our company or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against our company and our directors and officers 

risks related to the separation 

as an independent publicly traded company we may not enjoy the same benefits that we did as a part of danaher 

as an independent publicly traded company we are more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of the current danaher organizational structure as part of danaher we were able to enjoy certain benefits from danaher’s operating diversity purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with danaher’s other businesses as an independent publicly traded company we do not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and do not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets 

potential indemnification liabilities to danaher pursuant to our separation agreement with danaher could materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our separation agreement with danaher among other things provides for indemnification obligations for uncapped amounts designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities whether incurred prior to or after the separation if we are required to indemnify danaher under the circumstances set forth in the separation agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

in connection with the separation danaher has indemnified us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that danaher’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements with danaher the “agreements” danaher has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that danaher has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from danaher will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities or that danaher will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in addition danaher’s insurers may attempt to deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from danaher or such insurance providers any amounts for which we may be held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our businesses financial position results of operations and cash flows 

there could be significant liability if the separation fails to qualify as a taxfree transaction for us federal income tax purposes 

it was a condition to the distribution of all of our shares of common stock to the holders of danaher common stock in connection with the separation that danaher receive an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp tax counsel to danaher regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is taxfree to danaher and danaher’s shareholders for us federal income tax purposes within the meaning of sections 355a and 

368a1d of the code the opinion relied on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from danaher and us including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied danaher may not be able to rely on the opinion and danaher and its shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel the internal revenue service “irs” could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion 

under the tax matters agreement between danaher and us we are required to indemnify danaher against taxes incurred by danaher that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take as the case may be certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a taxfree distribution under section 355 of the code under the tax matters agreement between danaher and us we may also be required to indemnify danaher for other contingent tax liabilities which could materially adversely affect our financial position even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of danaher under the tax matters agreement we nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if danaher were to fail to pay them if we are required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law the amounts may be significant 

we may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for a twoyear period after the separation 

to preserve the taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes to danaher of the separation under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with danaher we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under the tax matters agreement for the twoyear period following the distribution we are subject to specific restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisition merger liquidation sale and stock redemption transactions with respect to our stock these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business these restrictions do not limit the acquisition of other businesses by us for cash consideration in addition under the tax matters agreement we may be required to indemnify danaher against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets even if it does not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition 

certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in danaher 

because of their current or former positions with danaher certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in danaher in addition certain of our directors are currently serving on the danaher board of directors continuing ownership of shares of danaher common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if we and danaher face decisions that could have implications for both danaher and us 

we or danaher may fail to perform under the various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

the separation agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with the separation determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnification related to liabilities and obligations the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation we are relying on danaher to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if danaher is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire we may not be able to operate our businesses effectively and our profitability may decline internally and by engaging third parties we have created and continue to create our own systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that danaher provided to us however we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from danaher’s systems to ours 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations 

in connection with the separation danaher undertook several corporate restructuring transactions which together with the separation may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these restructuring transactions or the separation 



 then the court could void the separation in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareholders to return to danaher some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution or require danaher or us as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the fair value of its liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as that debt matures

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

fortive is a diversified industrial growth company comprised of professional instrumentation and industrial technologies segments and encompassing businesses that are recognized leaders in attractive markets our wellknown brands hold leading positions in field solutions transportation technology sensing product realization automation and specialty and franchise distribution markets our businesses design develop service manufacture and market professional and engineered products software and services for a variety of end markets building upon leading brand names innovative technology and significant market positions our research and development manufacturing sales distribution service and administrative facilities are located in more than 40  countries  across north america asia pacific europe and latin america  

we completed the separation on july 2 2016 the first day of our fiscal third quarter before that date fortive was a wholly owned subsidiary of danaher and our businesses were comprised of certain danaher operating units danaher transfered these businesses to us prior to the separation the separation was completed in the form of a pro rata distribution by danaher to its stockholders of record on june 15 2016 of all of the outstanding shares of fortive held by danaher fortive was incorporated in the state of delaware on november 10 2015 in order to facilitate the separation 

in connection with the separation on july 1 2016 we entered into the agreements that govern the separation and the relationships between the parties following the separation including an employee matters agreement a tax matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a danaher business system license agreement and a transition services agreement 

this mda is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management our mda is divided into seven sections 



basis of presentation 

the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements present our historical financial position results of operations changes in equity and cash flows in accordance with gaap the combined financial statements for periods prior to the separation were derived from danaher’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and prepared in accordance with gaap for the preparation of carvedout combined financial statements through the date of the separation all revenues and costs as well as assets and liabilities directly associated with fortive have been included in the combined financial statements prior to the separation the combined financial statements also included allocations of certain general administrative sales and marketing expenses and cost of sales from danaher’s corporate office and from other danaher businesses to the company and allocations of related assets liabilities and the former parent’s investment as applicable the allocations were determined on a reasonable basis however the amounts are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had the company been an entity that operated independently of danaher during the applicable periods  related party allocations prior to the separation including the method for such allocation are discussed further in note 19 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

following the separation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of fortive and those of our whollyowned subsidiaries and no longer include any allocations from danaher   

these consolidated and combined financial statements may not be indicative of our results had we been a separate standalone entity throughout the periods presented nor are the results stated herein indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future 

overview 

general 

please see “item 1 business – general” included in this annual report for a discussion of the company’s strategies for delivering longterm shareholder value fortive is a multinational business with global operations during 2016  approximately 44  of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states as a diversified industrial growth company with global operations our businesses are affected by worldwide regional and industryspecific economic and political factors our geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of our products software and services typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country except for the united states on our operating results given the broad range of products manufactured software and services provided and geographies served we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers including to the extent possible their sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 

as a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of opportunities and challenges including technological development in most of the markets we serve the expansion and evolution of opportunities in highgrowth markets trends and costs associated with a global labor force and consolidation of our competitors we define highgrowth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include eastern europe the middle east africa latin america and asia with the exception of japan and australia we operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and our longterm growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments identify consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions develop innovative and differentiated new products services and software expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment we are making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing research and development and customerfacing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world 

in this report references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from operations calculated according to gaap but excluding 1 sales impacts from acquired businesses 2 sales impacts from the separation and 3 the impact of currency translation references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit as applicable from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales or operating profit as applicable attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture sales impacts from the separation refer to sales to or from danaher made under agreements entered into or terminated in connection with the separation prior to the first anniversary of the separation the portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between a the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales from acquired businesses or the separation and b the periodtoperiod change in sales excluding sales from acquired businesses or the separation after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period   sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to and 

not as a replacement for or superior to sales and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

management believes that reporting the nongaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items including the impact of agreements with danaher that were entered into or terminated in connection with the separation because the nature size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers in addition we exclude the impact of agreements that were terminated or entered into in connection with the separation because we believe that excluding such impact may be useful to investors in assessing our operational performance independent of the impact on sales to or from danaher resulting primarily from the separation we exclude the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisition and divestiture including separationrelated items and currency translation may facilitate assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of longterm performance references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales 

business performance and outlook 

while differences exist among our businesses on an overall basis demand for our products software and services increased during 2016 as compared to 2015  resulting in aggregate yearoveryear sales growth from existing businesses of 10  our professional instrumentation segment returned to growth during the second half of 2016 led by increased demand in the advanced instrumentation  solutions business and yearoveryear sales growth in the industrial technologies segment continued to be led by increased demand in the transportation technologies business driven by implementation deadlines relating to the enhanced credit card security requirements based on the emv global standards as well as continued share gains in the franchise distribution businesses we expect the emvrelated rate of growth to decelerate during 2017 due to the recent extension of the compliance deadlines for outdoor payment systems and the decreasing rate of growth for indoor pointofsale solutions however we expect emvrelated demand to continue to drive moderate growth in 2017 and be a significant growth driver for the next several years our continued investments in sales growth initiatives and new product introductions as well as indications of stabilization in broadbased market conditions and other businessspecific factors discussed below also contributed to overall sales growth during the year 

geographically sales from existing businesses grew at lowsingle digit rates in both developed and highgrowth markets during 2016 as compared to 2015 sales from existing businesses grew at a midsingle digit rate in asia led by growth in china and at lowsingle digit rates in europe and the united states partly offset by doubledigit rate contractions in sales in latin america and canada we expect overall sales from existing businesses to grow on a yearoveryear basis during 2017 but remain cautious about challenges due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties including global uncertainties related to monetary fiscal and trade policies as well as other factors identified in “item 1a risk factors” 

acquisitions and divestitures 

during 2016  we acquired three  businesses for total consideration of 190 million in cash net of cash acquired the businesses acquired complement existing units of both our segments the aggregate annual sales of these three businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately 47 million  

during 2015 we acquired two businesses for total consideration of 37 million in cash net of cash acquired the businesses acquired complement existing units of both our segments the aggregate annual sales of these two businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were 18 million 

during 2014 we acquired six businesses for total consideration of 289 million in cash net of cash acquired the businesses acquired complement existing businesses of both our segments the aggregate annual sales of these six businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were 133 million 

in august 2014 we completed the divestiture of our evshybrid product line for a sale price of 87 million in cash this product line which was part of the industrial technologies segment had revenues of approximately 60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture we recorded a pretax gain on the sale of the product line of 34 million 26 million aftertax in our 2014 results this amount is recorded in other income subsequent to the sale we have no continuing involvement in the evshybrid product line

2016 compared to 2015 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment contributed 05  to sales growth during 2016 as compared to 2015 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s advanced instrumentation  solutions businesses declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 the business continued to experience stabilization in demand during the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half 2016 and reported increased demand from existing businesses in the second half of 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year period geographically sales from existing businesses declined in the united states and latin america partly offset by increases in china and western europe demand for field solutions products and services declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 with yearoveryear sales declines during the first half of 

the year partly offset by yearoveryear sales growth during the second half of 2016 during 2016 yearoveryear demand increased for online conditionbased monitoring equipment and network tools as well as for thermography equipment in china while demand decreased for calibration and biomedical equipment on a yearoveryear basis industrial product sales for field solutions products and services declined during 2016 but grew during the second half of 2016 compared to the comparable period in 2015 reflecting a stabilization in end customer demand yearoveryear sales of product realization services and products declined at a midsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 declines in some major product realization product lines were partly offset by growth in education and defenserelated end markets and semiconductor and communications end markets in china as well as increased demand for precision electrical measurement products and video network monitoring products demand for design engineering and manufacturing services increased on a yearoveryear basis but slowed during the second half of 2016 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s sensing technologies businesses declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 demand in these businesses continued to stabilize throughout the year and delivered highsingle digit growth on a yearoveryear basis during the fourth quarter of 2016 sales declines during 2016 for control products were partially offset by increased sales of sensing products primarily in the food and beverage medical equipment and heating and air conditioning endmarkets geographically sales from existing businesses decreased on a yearoveryear basis in north america partly offset by improved demand in asia 

operating profit margins decreased 120  basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015 the following factors unfavorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 



2015 compared to 2014 

price increases in the segment contributed 10 to yearoveryear sales growth during 2015 as compared to 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s advanced instrumentation  solutions businesses increased slightly during 2015 as compared to 2014 field solutions products grew at a lowsingle digit rate driven by increased yearoveryear demand for electrical calibration thermography networking and biomedical products as well as online conditionbased monitoring equipment geographically demand for field solutions products increased in asia western europe and the middle east sales of product realization services and products declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014 increased yearoveryear demand for nextgeneration oscilloscopes and video network monitoring products and services was more than offset by decreased demand across all other major product and service lines geographically demand increased for product realization services and products in china and western europe but was more than offset by softer demand in russia latin america north america and japan 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s sensing technologies business declined at a midsingle digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014 due to lower demand in all major endmarkets geographically decreased yearoveryear demand in north america and western europe was partially offset by sales growth in china and latin america 

operating profit margins increased 120 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of transition services agreements entered into in connection with danaher divestitures net of incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various product development sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger us dollar in 2015 

industrial technologies 

the industrial technologies segment consists of our transportation technologies automation  specialty components and franchise distribution businesses our transportation technologies business is a leading worldwide provider of solutions and services focused on fuel dispensing remote fuel management pointofsale and payment systems environmental compliance vehicle tracking and fleet management and traffic management   the automation  specialty components business provides a wide range of electromechanical and electronic motion control products   and mechanical components  as well as supplemental braking systems for commercial vehicles   our franchise distribution business manufactures and distributes professional tools and a fullline of wheel service equipment

2016 compared to 2015 

yearoveryear price increases in the segment contributed 03  to sales growth during 2016 as compared to 2015 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s transportation technologies businesses grew at a highsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to strong demand for dispenser payment and pointofsale systems environmental compliance products as well as vehicle and fleet management products partly offset by weaker yearoveryear demand for compressed natural gas products as expected beginning in the second half of 2016 the business began to experience reduced emvrelated demand for indoor pointofsale solutions as customers had largely upgraded to products that support indoor emv requirements in the prior year in response to the indoor liability shift however demand increased on a yearoveryear basis for dispensers and payment systems as customers in the united states continued to upgrade equipment driven primarily by the emv deadlines related to outdoor payment systems we expect this trend to continue to drive moderate growth in 2017 and be a significant growth driver for the next several years although the rate of growth is expected to decelerate during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to the recent extension of the liability shift for outdoor payment systems geographically sales from existing businesses continued to increase on a yearoveryear basis in the united states and to a lesser extent in asia and western europe 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation  specialty components business declined at a lowsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 the businesses experienced sequential yearoveryear improvement in demand during 

the second half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2016 during 2016 yearoveryear demand declined for engine retarder products due primarily to weakness in the north american heavytruck market partly offset by strong growth in china and europe in addition yearoveryear demand declined in certain medical and defense related end markets which were partly offset by increased yearoveryear demand for industrial automation products particularly in china geographically sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation  specialty components businesses declined in north america partly offset by growth in western europe and china 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s franchise distribution business grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to continued net increases in franchisees as well as continued growth in demand for professional tool products and tool storage products primarily in the united states this growth was partly offset by yearoveryear declines in wheel service equipment sales during 2016 

operating profit margins increased 70  basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015 the following factors favorably impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 



2015 compared to 2014 

price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on yearoveryear sales growth during 2015 as compared to 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s transportation technologies business grew at a midsingle digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014 as yearoveryear demand for the business’ dispenser systems service and pointofsale systems continued to be strong in north america and india during 2015 customers predominantly in the united states had begun to upgrade pointofsale systems to comply with deadlines for enhanced credit card security requirements based on the emv global standard this growth was partially offset by lower yearoveryear sales of retail petroleum products in the middle east russia and western europe largely due to softness in demand from integrated oil companies 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation  specialty components business increased slightly during 2015 as compared to 2014 a strong increase in yearoveryear demand in technology and defense related endmarkets in north america and distribution and industrial automation related endmarkets in europe was largely offset by lower demand in north american distribution and industrial automation related endmarkets as well as agricultural related endmarkets in north america and europe sales in the engine retarder business were essentially flat on a yearoveryear basis with stronger demand in north america and europe offset by softer demand in china yearoveryear sales comparisons are also adversely affected by the sale of our evshybrid product line in the third quarter of 2014 which was not treated as a discontinued operation and the impact of which is reflected in “acquisitions divestitures net” in the components of sales growth table above see note 3  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  for additional information related to this transaction 

sales from existing businesses in the segment’s franchise distribution business grew at a lowdouble digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014 due to continued strong demand for tool storage solutions as well as increases in the number of franchisees primarily in the united states 

operating profit margins increased 70 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014 the following factors impacted yearoveryear operating profit margin comparisons 

2015 vs 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by  



2015 vs 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by  



cost of sales and gross profit 



cost of sales increased on a yearoveryear basis during 2016 as compared to 2015  due primarily to the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various growth investments and restructuring actions partly offset by the continued effect of a strong us dollar and the incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring and continued productivity material cost and supply chain improvement actions 

cost of sales decreased on a yearoveryear basis during 2015  as compared to 2014  due primarily to the effect of a stronger us dollar incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring actions and continued productivity improvement initiatives and lower yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions partially offset by the impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes 

gross profit margins increased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis during 2016 as compared to 2015  due primarily to the favorable impact of pricing improvements and higher yearoveryear sales volumes incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in 2015 and 2016 continued productivity and material cost and supply chain improvement actions partly offset by incremental yearoveryear costs associated with various growth investments and higher yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions 

gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a yearoveryear basis during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the favorable impact of higher yearoveryear sales volumes and incremental yearoveryear cost savings associated with restructuring actions and continued productivity improvement initiatives 

operating expenses 



the yearoveryear increase in sga expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflects the increased general and administrative costs required to operate as a standalone public company as compared to the allocations derived from danaher in periods prior to the separation continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and incremental yearoveryear costs associated with restructuring actions partly offset by yearover year cost savings associated with restructuring actions taken in 2015 and 2016 the impact of continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the incrementally favorable impact of yearoveryear impairment charges recorded during 2016 and 2015 related to certain tradenames used in the industrial technologies segment sga expense as a percentage of sales increased 60  basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015 

the yearoveryear decrease in sga expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 reflects incremental yearoveryear investments in our sales and marketing growth initiatives which were more than offset by the effect of a stronger us dollar in 2015 yearover year cost savings associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of transition services agreements entered into in connection with danaher divestitures sga expense as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points on a yearoveryear basis as compared to 2014 

rd expenses consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a yearoveryear basis in 2016 as compared to 2015 incremental yearoveryear increases in investments in our product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase rd expenses as a percentage of sales were flat on a yearoveryear basis in 2015 as compared to 2014 

interest costs 

for a discussion of our outstanding indebtedness refer to note 10  to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

interest expense of 490 million was recorded in 2016 arising from our outstanding indebtedness initiated in june 2016 before the separation we depended on danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries as a result with the exception of cash cash equivalents and borrowings clearly associated with fortive and related to the separation we recorded no interest expense in our combined financial statements for periods prior to the separation in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may enter into additional borrowings under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities andor access the capital markets if we enter into such additional financing transactions the amount of annual interest expense will increase 

gain on sale of product line 

in august 2014 we completed the divestiture of our evshybrid product line for a sale price of 87 million in cash this product line which was part of the industrial technologies segment had revenues of approximately 60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture operating results of the product line were not significant to our segment or overall reported results we recorded a pretax gain on the sale of the product line of 34 million 26 million aftertax in our 2014 results subsequent to the sale we have no continuing involvement in the evshybrid product line 

income taxes 

general 

income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements we record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 

our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and periodtoperiod changes in such accruals the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns as discussed below the expiration of statutes of limitations the implementation of tax planning strategies tax rulings court decisions settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws including legislative policy changes that may result from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” initiative on base erosion and profit shifting 

the oecd has issued significant global tax policy changes that include both expanded reporting as well as technical global tax policy changes many countries in which we operate have implemented tax law and administrative changes that align with many aspects of the oecd policy guidelines a number of the expanded reporting requirements are initially due in 2017 based upon 2016 results and we have taken comprehensive measures to address the requirements of these changes in global tax policy we do not expect these global tax policy changes to have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

the majority of our operations are located in the united states we expect the us government to enact major corporate income tax reform during 2017 and a number of legislative proposals have been put forward for example the us house of representatives has issued a tax reform blueprint that would significantly lower the us corporate tax rate expand the tax base by eliminating certain deductions such as interest expense and the section 199 deduction for us manufacturing activities provide a territorial tax system and a onetime tax on prior unrepatriated earnings and add a border adjustment mechanism we are monitoring these developments closely 

we conduct business globally and as part of our global business we file numerous income tax returns in the us federal state and foreign jurisdictions the countries in which we have a significant presence that have lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china germany and the united kingdom our ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states is dependent on our levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and under current us tax law we believe that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on our financial statements given the geographic dispersion of our taxable income   

the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities which may result in proposed assessments we review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis based on these reviews the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters please refer to “item 1a risk factors”   

we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities in connection with the separation we entered into the agreements with danaher including a tax matters agreement the tax matters agreement distinguishes between the treatment of tax matters for “joint” filings compared to “separate” filings prior to the separation “joint” filings involve legal entities such as those in the united states that include operations from both danaher and the company by contrast “separate” filings involve certain entities primarily outside of the united states that exclusively include either danaher’s or the company’s operations respectively in accordance with the tax matters agreement danaher is liable for and has indemnified fortive against all income tax liabilities involving “joint” filings for periods prior to the separation the company remains liable for certain preseparation income tax liabilities including those related to the company’s “separate” filings   

pursuant to us tax law the company’s initial us federal income tax return is for the short taxable year july 2 2016 through december 31 2016 we expect to file our initial us federal income tax return for the 2016 short tax year with the  irs during 2017 therefore the irs has not yet begun an examination of the company our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are under routine audit examinations for the tax years 2007 to 2016 

comparison of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

for periods prior to the separation current income tax liabilities related to entities which filed jointly with danaher are assumed to be immediately settled with danaher and are relieved through former parent’s investment income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in the consolidated and combined financial statements are presented as if we filed a separate tax return the separate tax return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a standalone taxpayer for the periods prior to the separation the calculation of our income taxes on a separate income tax return basis requires considerable judgment estimates and allocations 

our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was 271  320  and 309  respectively 

our effective tax rate for each of 2016  2015  and 2014  differs from the us federal statutory rate of 350  due principally to our earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the us federal statutory rate and from certain tax benefits and credits provided by law the effective tax rate for 2016 includes benefits from the release of reserves resulting from expirations of statutes of limitations primarily from periods prior to the separation 

comprehensive income 

comprehensive income decreased  by 9 million  in 2016 as compared to 2015 increased net earnings of 9 million  and favorable yearoveryear changes in foreign currency translation adjustments were more than offset by unfavorable pension benefit adjustments we recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 124 million  in 2016 compared to a translation loss of 132 million  in 2015 we recorded a pension benefit adjustments loss of 8 million  in 2016 compared to a gain of 18 million  in 2015 

comprehensive income increased by 40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 net earnings decreased by 20 million which was more than offset by favorable yearoveryear changes in foreign currency translation and pension benefit adjustments we recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 132 million in 2015 compared to a translation loss of 154 million in 2014 we recorded a pension benefit adjustments gain of 18 million in 2015 compared to a loss of 19 million in 2014 

inflation 

the effect of inflation on our revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31   2016  2015  or 2014  

financial instruments and risk management 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates credit risk and commodity prices each of which could impact our financial statements we generally address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities in addition our broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole 

interest rate risk 

we manage interest cost using a mixture of fixedrate and variablerate debt a change in interest rates on longterm debt impacts the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixedrate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise as of december 31 2016  an increase of 100  basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt by approximately 186 million  

as of december 31 2016  our variablerate debt obligations consisted primarily of us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper and term loan borrowings refer to note 10  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2016  as a result our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in shortterm interest rates as these shorter duration obligations mature we anticipate issuing additional shortterm commercial paper obligations and term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings since the separation the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding term loan borrowings and us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper was approximately 172  090  and 006  respectively in addition we recorded interest expense of 63 million  on these variablerate obligations a hypothetical 9 basis points  increase in market interest rates as of december 31 2016  on our variablerate debt obligations would have increased our interest expense by 15 million  in 2016  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary we also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into us dollars our functional currency costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period as a result we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of equity a 100  depreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar as of december 31 2016  would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’s equity of approximately 166 million  

currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2016  reported sales by 10  as compared to 2015  as the us dollar was on average stronger against most major currencies during 2016  as compared to exchange rate levels during 2015  if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31 2016  were to prevail throughout 2017 currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2017 estimated sales by approximately 16  relative to our performance in 2016  in general additional strengthening of the us dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis and any weakening of the us dollar against other major currencies would positively impact our sales and results of operations 

we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales profit and assets and liabilities in our consolidated and combined financial statements 

credit risk 

we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments and receivables from customers we place cash and temporary investments with various highquality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents we emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds 

in addition concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 

commodity price risk 

for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

liquidity and capital resources 

prior to the separation we were dependent upon danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries with the exception of cash cash equivalents and borrowings clearly associated with fortive and related to the separation including the financial transactions described below financial transactions relating to our business operations during the period prior to the separation were accounted for through the former parent’s investment net “former parent’s investment” account accordingly none of our former parent’s cash cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level was assigned to the company in the financial statements for the periods prior to the separation 

as a result of the separation we no longer participate in danaher’s cash management and financing operations we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in existing businesses consummate strategic acquisitions make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and manage our capital structure on a short and longterm basis 

during 2016 we completed the following financing transactions 

 approximately 30 billion  of the net proceeds of these financings activities was paid to danaher in june 2016 as a cash dividend in connection with the separation refer to note 10  of the consolidated and combined financial statements for more information related to our longterm indebtedness 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the sec and cause to be declared effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of notes for registered notes with terms that are substantially identical to the notes of such series alternatively if the exchange offers are not available or cannot be completed we would be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to file and cause to be declared effective a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the notes under the securities act if we do not comply with these obligations we will be required to pay additional interest on the notes   we expect to file the required registration statement during the first half of 2017 

overview of cash flows and liquidity 

following is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes restructuring activities pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows 

cash flows from operations increased 128 million  or approximately 127  during 2016 as compared to 2015 this yearoveryear change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the following factors 

 cash flows from operations increased 62 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to cash generated from higher operating profit in 2015 and lower investments in working capital in 2015 as compared to 2014 

investing activities 

cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities was approximately 311 million  during 2016 compared to approximately 174 million  and 291 million  of net cash used in 2015  and 2014 respectively 

net cash used in investing activities increased 137 million during 2016 as compared to 2015 principally due to higher levels of acquisitions during 2016 net cash used in investing activities decreased 117 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 principally due to lower levels of acquisitions during 2015 and proceeds from the divestiture of the evshybrid product line in 2014 for a discussion of our acquisitions and divestiture refer to “—overview” 

capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity replacing equipment supporting product development initiatives improving information technology systems and purchase of equipment that is used in operatingtype lease arrangements with customers capital expenditures totaled 130 million  in 2016 120 million  in 2015  and 103 million  in 2014 the change in capital expenditures is due primarily to timing of these investments in 2017 we expect capital spending to be between approximately 125 million and 135 million though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions 

financing activities and indebtedness 

cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and the issuance of debt in 2016 offset by the dividend paid to danaher in connection with the separation quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders and net transfers to former parent cash provided by financing activities was approximately 4 million in 2016 an increase of 839 million as compared to approximately 835 million used in 2015 due primarily to our incurrence of approximately 34 billion of indebtedness in 2016 as described above offset by the 30 billion  dividend paid to danaher in connection with the separation in addition yearoveryear net transfers to former parent decreased by approximately 534 million  net transfers to former parent represents net cash generated by operating and investing activities prior to the separation that were transferred to danaher and adjustments to balances transferred from danaher in accordance with the agreements 

we generally expect to satisfy any shortterm liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under the commercial paper programs under the us dollar and eurodenominated commercial paper programs we may issue unsecured shortterm promissory notes with maturities not exceeding 397 and 183  days respectively as of december 31 2016  commercial paper outstanding under the us dollardenominated commercial paper program had a weighted average annual interest rate of 108 and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 9  days as of december 31 2016  commercial paper outstanding under the eurodenominated commercial paper program had a weighted average annual interest rate of 006   and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately 35  days we classified our borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as of december 31 2016 as longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheet as we had the intent and ability as supported by availability under the revolving credit facility to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date as commercial paper obligations mature we may issue additional shortterm commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 

credit support for the commercial paper programs is provided by the revolving credit facility the availability of the revolving credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the commercial paper programs we expect to limit any borrowings under the revolving credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow if needed to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures 

the carrying value of total debt outstanding as of december 31 2016 was approximately 34 billion  we had 15 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016 of this amount approximately 375 million was being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances accordingly we had the ability to incur an additional 11 billion of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016 refer to note 10 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding our financing activities and indebtedness 

net cash used in financing activities increased 179 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 as more cash was transferred to danaher due to increases in operating cash flows and less cash was used in investing activities 

dividends 

following the separation we began paying a regular quarterly dividend during the third quarter of 2016 on november 3 2016 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007  per share that was paid on december 30 2016 to holders of record on november 25 2016 aggregate cash payments for the two quarterly dividends paid to shareholders during 2016 were 484 million  

on january 24 2017 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 007  per share payable on march 31 2017 to holders of record on february 24 2017 

cash and cash requirements 

as of december 31 2016 we held approximately 8032 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investmentgrade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with a negligible weighted average annual interest rate substantially all of the cash was held outside of the united states 

while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws most of our foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits for most of our foreign subsidiaries we make an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states we have recorded a current tax liability for the funds that we plan to repatriate to the united states this year no provisions for us income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the amount of us income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments including acquisitions as of december 31 2016 we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs including our cash needs in the united states 

until the separation we were dependent upon danaher for all of our working capital and financing requirements under danaher’s centralized approach to cash management and financing of operations of its subsidiaries because we were part of danaher for the periods prior to separation no cash cash equivalents and borrowings were included in the consolidated and combined financial statements at december 31 2015 for all periods prior to the separation other financial transactions relating to our business operations were accounted for through the former parent’s investment account 

we have cash requirements to support working capital needs capital expenditures and acquisitions pay interest and service debt pay taxes and any related interest or penalties fund our restructuring activities and pension plans as required pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs or objectives with respect to our cash requirements we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements but in the event that additional liquidity is required particularly in connection with acquisitions we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs andor access the capital markets we also may from time to time access the capital markets including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions 

during 2016 we contributed 11 million  to our nonus defined benefit pension plans during 2017 our cash contribution requirements for our nonus defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately 10 million  the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon among other things legal requirements underlying asset returns the plan’s funded status the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution local practices market conditions interest rates and other factors 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 under 1 longterm debt obligations 2 leases 3 purchase obligations and 4 other longterm liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap certain of our acquisitions may involve the potential payment of contingent consideration the table below does not reflect any such obligations as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain refer to “—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below 



  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table sets forth by period due or year of expected expiration as applicable a summary of our offbalance sheet commitments as of december 31 2016  



guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors customers financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure our obligations andor performance requirements related to specific transactions 

other offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have from time to time divested certain of our businesses and assets in connection with these divestitures we often provide representations warranties andor indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters commercial disputes environmental matters or tax matters we have not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and we cannot reasonably estimate the potential liabilities from such matters but we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on our financial statements in addition as a result of these divestitures as well as restructuring activities certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements we believe the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial statements 

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers suppliers or other business partners for specific risks such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of our products or services or claims alleging that our products services or software infringe third party intellectual property we have not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above historically we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations 

our restated certificate of incorporation requires us to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated bylaws provide for similar indemnification rights in addition we have executed with each of our directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which we have agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding while we maintain insurance for this type of liability a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 

legal proceedings 

please refer to note 15  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies please refer to “item 1a risk factor” 

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments 

we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates refer to note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

accounts receivable  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in our portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires us to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from our trade accounts contract and financing receivable portfolios the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality we regularly perform detailed reviews of our accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate with a severity frequency andor timing different from our assumptions additional allowances would be required and our financial statements would be adversely impacted 

inventories  we record inventory at the lower of cost or market value we estimate the market value of our inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand technological advances and pricing competition in many of our markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond our control if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected we could be required to reduce the value of our inventory which would adversely impact our financial statements refer to note 5  to the consolidated and combined financial statements 

acquired intangibles  our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill inprocess rd and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur refer to notes 2 3 and 7 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill acquired intangibles and acquisitions 

in performing our goodwill impairment testing we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach we estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses  in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units including operating results business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected in certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis ie an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach  the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth future operating margins discount rates and terminal values there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 

in 2016 we had twelve  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment we believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from 7 million  to 11 billion  our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2016 indicated that in all instances the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 0 to approximately 850 in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values based on this hypothetical 10 decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 10 to approximately 750 after applying the hypothetical 10 decrease only one reporting unit’s hypothetical fair value was below its carrying value we evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of this reporting unit including as applicable results of the estimated fair value using an income approach market positions of the businesses comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance and we concluded no impairment charge was required 

we review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues expenses market conditions and discount rates related to these assets 

if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements 

contingent liabilities  as discussed in note 15  to the consolidated and combined financial statements we are from time to time subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business or the business operations of previously owned entities we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes the anticipated outcome of negotiations the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims in addition because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time liabilities may change in the future due to various factors including those discussed in note 15  to the consolidated and combined financial statements if the reserves we 

established with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate we would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves which would adversely affect our financial statements 

revenue recognition  we derive revenues from the sale of products and services refer to note 2  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 

although most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions as a result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element we allocate revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instances may require us to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable our estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements 

if our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect our revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected 

corporate allocations  prior to the separation we operated as part of danaher and not as a standalone company accordingly we had been allocated certain shared costs which are reflected as expenses in the combined financial statements for the periods prior to the separation we consider the allocation methodologies used to be reasonable and appropriate reflections of the related expenses attributable to the company for purposes of the combined financial statements however the expenses reflected in the combined financial statements may not be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred during the periods prior to the separation if we had operated as a separate standalone entity in addition the expenses reflected in the combined financial statements may not be indicative of expenses that we will incur in the future refer to note 19  to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a description of the preseparation allocations from danaher and related party transactions 

stockbased compensation  for a description of our stockbased compensation accounting practices refer to note 16  to our consolidated and combined financial statements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards require subjective assumptions including the expected life of the awards stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate given our limited trading history following the separation stock price volatility used to calculate the fair value of stockbased payment awards in the postseparation period was estimated based on an average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent our best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates our equitybased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

pension  for a description of our pension accounting practices refer to note 11  to the consolidated and combined financial statements certain of our nonus employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans calculations of the amount of pension costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions regarding discount rates expected return on plan assets rates of salary increases health care cost trend rates mortality rates and other factors if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change as a result of differences in actual experience changes in key economic indicators or other factors our financial statements could be materially affected a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans during 2016 would have increased the net obligation by 29 million   22 million  on an after tax basis from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31 2016 

our plan assets consist of various insurance contracts equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated longterm rate of return for the plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 18  to 60  if the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets during 2016 was reduced by 50 basis points pension expense in 2016 would have increased by 10 million   07 million  on an aftertax basis 

income taxes  for a description of our income tax accounting policies refer to notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated and combined financial statements we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding 1 the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 2 expected future taxable income and 3 the impact of tax planning strategies future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on our financial statements 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if in our assessment it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits 

recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances including when i a tax audit is completed ii applicable tax laws change including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance or iii the applicable statute of limitations expires 

in addition certain of the company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities see “—results of operations – income taxes” and note 12  to the consolidated and combined financial statements we believe the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws however the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in us being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements including our effective tax rate 

an increase in our 2016 nominal tax rate of 10 would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 of 12 million 

new accounting standards 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201704 intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  which aims to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation under the new standard an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill this standard is effective for us prospectively beginning january 1 2020 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201616 income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory  which aims to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory current guidance prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intraentity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party asu 201616 provides that an entity should recognize both the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs this standard is effective for us beginning january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted using a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements   

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201615 statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  which clarifies the classification and presentation of eight specific cash flow issues in the statement of cash flows in november 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash which clarifies that restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included in cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows these standards are effective for us beginning january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted using a retrospective transition approach unless impracticable although the assessment of the impact of the new standards has not yet completed we do not anticipate the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on our financial statements   

in march 2016 the fasb” issued asu no 201609 compensation—stock compensation topic 718  which aims to simplify several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows and accounting for forfeitures the asu requires that the difference between the actual tax benefit realized upon exercise and the tax benefit recorded based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant the “excess tax benefit” be reflected as a reduction of the current period provision for income taxes with any shortfall recorded as an increase in the tax provision currently the excess tax benefit is recorded as a component of additional paidin capital the asu also requires the excess tax benefit realized to be reflected as an operating cash flow rather than as a financing cash flow under current gaap we will adopt this standard beginning january 1 2017 we expect this standard to favorably impact our tax rate by approximately 50 basis points in 2017 however due to the inherent uncertainties related to among other things the timing of employee stock option exercises or the vesting of stock awards and any difference between the underlying stock price on the date of the grant as compared to the date of exercise or vesting actual results will likely differ from this estimate and depending on the above factors may adversely affect our financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases topic 842  which will require among other items lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for most leases extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures including significant judgments made by management will be required to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense 

recognized and expected to be recognized from existing contracts the accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under the current standard this standard is effective for us beginning january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted using a modified retrospective transition approach and provides for certain practical expedients we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements   

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201511 simplifying the measurement of inventory topic 330  which modifies existing requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market under existing standards the market amount requires consideration of replacement cost net realizable value “nrv” and nrv less an approximately normal profit margin the new asu replaces market with nrv defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation this eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or nrv less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring the market value of inventory we will adopt this standard prospectively beginning january 1 2017 the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements   

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity’s revenue recognition the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services during 2016 the fasb issued several amendments to the standard including clarification to the guidance on reporting revenues as a principal versus an agent identifying performance obligations accounting for intellectual property licenses assessing collectability presentation of sales taxes impairment testing for contract costs and disclosure of performance obligations the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown or the modified retrospective method in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method this standard is effective for us beginning january 1 2018 we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures and will adopt this standard on january 1 2018   

the impact of adopting this standard is not expected to be material we expect recognition of revenue for a majority of customer contracts to remain substantially unchanged while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard we currently believe the more significant impacts relate to certain customer contracts that will be recognized over time accounting for deferral of commissions which previously were expensed as incurred and may qualify for capitalization under the new standard and changes to the timing of recognition of revenue and costs related to certain warranty arrangements
