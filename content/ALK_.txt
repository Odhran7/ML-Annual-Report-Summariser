alaska air group the company or air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines alaska and horizon alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of alaska horizon is a washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981 and was acquired by air group in 1986 air group acquired virgin america in 2016 then legally merged the entity with alaska in 2018 at which time the airlines operating certificates were also combined the company also includes mcgee air services an aviation services provider that was established as a whollyowned subsidiary of alaska in 2016 and other subsidiaries 

alaska and horizon operate as separate airlines with individual business plans competitive factors and economic risks we organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments which are as follows 

• mainline  includes scheduled air transportation on alaskas boeing and airbus jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the us and in parts of mexico costa rica and belize 

• regional  includes horizons and other thirdparty carriers’ scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the us and canada under capacity purchase agreements cpa this segment includes the actual revenues and expenses associated with regional flying as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by air group on behalf of the regional operations 

• horizon  includes the capacity sold to alaska under a cpa expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs ownership costs and maintenance costs 

together we are the fifth largest airline in the united states offering unparalleled guest service connectivity and schedules from our hub markets along the west coast with our regional partners we fly to more than 120 destinations throughout north america we have operated in a highly competitive and often challenging industry for nearly 90 years our top priority as an airline is ensuring the safety of our guests and employees an area that we continually invest in our success over many decades and resilience in difficult times is attributable to our people business model and commitment to sustainable growth over the longterm 

in 2021 our business continued to recover from the impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic that began in 2020 demand for travel improved considerably in 2021 as travel restrictions and stayathome orders relaxed however progress was volatile as new covid19 variants impacted the communities that we serve in response to the uncertainties in recovery we scaled capacity back up in a measured way bringing flying back as demand materialized this approach was a critical factor that enabled us to return to profitability in the second half of the year as a result our 2021 operating cash flows were positive even when excluding the impact of government grants this progress enabled us to repay 13 billion in debt and return our debt to capitalization ratio to 49 the lowest level since the first quarter of 2020 in addition we voluntarily funded a 100 million pension contribution bringing our funded status to 98 as of year end 

the improved results in 2021 set a foundation for our return to precovid flying levels by summer 2022 and growth from there our 2025 plan includes ambitious goals including aligning our growth strategy with critical environmental social and governance targets instrumental to achieving this is our restructured fleet agreement with boeing which includes firm commitments for 93 new 7379 aircraft to be delivered through 2024 with options to purchase 52 additional aircraft these deliveries began in earnest in 2021 and ramp up significantly in 2022 the new 7379 aircraft replace the aging airbus a320 aircraft which will be retired from the operating fleet by 2023 significantly improved perseat economics driven by larger gauge and improved fuel efficiency as well as the transition to a single mainline fleet will serve as the baseline for highmargin capacity growth over the next several years 

in 2021 recovery of leisure demand outpaced recovery of business demand responding to these trends we adapted our network to take our guests where they want to fly we announced 32 new routes to popular leisure destinations including belize with new routes announced in 2021 we will serve 100 nonstop destinations from seattletacoma international airport by summer 2022 more than any other carrier we also formally joined the one world® alliance in 2021 which provides global access for our guests and exciting growth opportunities for our airlines as we grow our west coast hubs we plan to maximize connectivity to partner airlines allowing our guests greater global connectivity by summer 2022 alaska guests will be able to access 100 nonstop flights to europe from the west coast on one world partners although we have ambitious growth plans we will continue to deploy capacity in a disciplined manner that is responsive to changing demand trends 

our success is fueled by the engagement and dedication of our employees aligning our employees goals with the companys goals is critical in achieving success to that end all employees participate in our performancebased pay pbp and 

operational performance rewards opr programs which reward employees across all work groups based on metrics related to safety profitability and cash flow sustainability ontime performance low costs and customer satisfaction in 2021 we rewarded employees with 151 million under these incentive programs 

air group 

our airlines operate different aircraft and missions alaska operates a fleet of narrowbody passenger jets on primarily longer stagelength routes alaska contracts primarily with horizon and skywest airlines inc skywest for shorterhaul capacity and receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates embraer 175 e175 regional jet aircraft and bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement cpa the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers the percentage of revenues by category is as follows 

we deploy aircraft in ways that we believe will best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce the impacts of seasonality 

the percentage of our capacity by region is as follows 

a category represents flying within the west coast departures from the west coast to other regions are captured in other categories 

mainline 

our mainline operations include boeing 737 b737 and airbus a320 family a320 and a321neo jet service offered by alaska we offer extensive passenger service from the western us throughout the contiguous united states alaska hawaii mexico costa rica and belize our largest concentrations of departures are in seattle portland and the bay area we also offer cargo service throughout our network and have three dedicated cargo aircraft that operate primarily to and within the state of alaska 

  

in 2021 we carried 23 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations up from 12 million in 2020 as demand for air travel rebounded from the lows of the covid19 pandemic at december 31 2021 our mainline operating fleet consisted of 177 b737 jet aircraft and 40 airbus a320 family jet aircraft 

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below

regional 

  

our regional operations consist primarily of flights operated by horizon and skywest in 2021 our regional operations carried approximately 9 million revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and carries approximately 65 of air groups regional revenue passengers 

based on 2021 horizon passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our most significant concentration of regional activity was in seattle and portland at december 31 2021 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 30 e175 jet aircraft and 32 bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft the regional fleet operated by skywest consisted of 32 e175 aircraft

frequent flyer program 

alaska airlines mileage plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits miles can be earned by flying on our airline which will accumulate faster because our miles are awarded on flight distance not spend miles can also be earned by flying with one of our partner airlines by using an alaska airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners as the newest member of one world our already extensive list of airline partners expanded and now comprises 23 partner airlines making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program and providing them reciprocal tier status on other one world carriers through alaska and our partners mileage plan members have access to a network of over 1000 worldwide travel destinations further members can receive up to 40000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold earning three miles per 1 spent on alaska airlines purchases and one mile per 1 spent on all other purchases alaska airlines visa signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the us and select alaska mastercard cardholders in canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling on the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines our partner airlines hotel stays or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines we believe all of these benefits give our mileage plan members more value than competing programs 

mileage plan revenues including those in the passenger revenue income statement line item represented approximately 20 of air groups total revenues in 2021 mileage plan helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers keeping existing customers actively engaged and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 

commercial agreements with other airlines 

our commercial agreements with other airlines fall into three categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline 

• frequent flyer agreements enable our mileage plan members to accrue miles and redeem them for flights on partner airlines 

• codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a blockspace arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

• interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers 

frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing a more diverse network and schedule options to our guests 

upon entrance to the one world alliance alaska added seven new airline partners and enhanced eight existing partnerships with one world members as a one world member alaskas elite mileage plan members now receive tier status matching across member airlines depending on tier status guests can enjoy a variety of privileges including access to more than 650 international first and business class lounges fast track through security priority baggage benefits priority checkin desks upgrades and priority boarding 

alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

• offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage credit and redemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on us and international airline partners 

• providing a consistent and seamless guest experience whether you are flying on alaska or one of our partners 

  

• giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and 

  

• providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs 

  

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time our codeshare and interline agreements generated 2 3 and 5 of our total marketed flight revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

a comprehensive summary of alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows 

a these airlines do not have their own frequent flyer program however alaskas mileage plan members can earn and redeem miles on these airlines route systems 

cargo and other revenue 

the company provides freight and mail services cargo the majority of cargo services are provided to commercial businesses and the united states postal service the company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination or is transferred to a thirdparty carrier for delivery 

the company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships hotel and car commissions and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as cargo and other revenue 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to potentially volatile business cycles resulting from factors such as a global pandemic economic conditions volatile fuel prices a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly impacted by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel aircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense or the price that we generally pay at the airport including taxes and fees plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past three years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 14 to 24 of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the us 

the price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past three years has ranged from a low of 39 per barrel in 2020 to a high of 68 in 2021 for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 16 million of fuel cost annually based on 2021 consumption levels said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon would have impacted our 2021 fuel cost by approximately 7 million 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years over the last three years average annual west coast refining margin prices have fluctuated from a low of 11 per barrel in 2020 to a high of 26 per barrel in 2019 

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 37 in 2021 after decreasing 29 in 2020 and decreasing 6 in 2019 

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 

a other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs 

we use crude oil call options as hedges against our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our price for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of declines in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption 

in 2020 alaska began using sustainable aviation fuel for certain flights departing from san francisco international airport sustainable aviation fuel prices are currently higher than traditional fuel prices as the market is developing we are evaluating options for obtaining the volume of sustainable aviation fuels that we expect will be necessary to move us towards our longterm sustainability goals these options include partnerships with alternative fuel companies and industry groups focused on ways to accelerate innovation in this area 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft and executing on operational best practices are the best hedges against high fuel prices maintaining a young fuelefficient fleet helps reduce our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry can be intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta air lines inc delta approximately 76 of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta as we have grown in california and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings united airlines and southwest airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve our california and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the pacific northwest as carriers further restore domestic capacity in the recovery from the covid19 pandemic we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase in the first quarter of 2022 

we believe that the following competitive factors matter to guests when making an air travel purchase decision 

  

• routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs 

we compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codeshare and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we do not serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles our mileage plan offers some of the most valuable benefits in the industry allowing our members the ability to earn and redeem miles on 23 partner carriers 

our 2021 entry into the one world alliance provides our guests increased global network utility and benefits and positions us to capture an incremental share of global travelers and corporate accounts as demand for air travel recovers further from the covid19 pandemic 

• safety and guest health 

safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do in its most recent rankings for 2022 airlineratingscom has again ranked alaska as the safest us airline within its ranking of the top 20 safest airlines in the world in 2020 we also received our 19th diamond award of excellence from the federal aviation administration faa recognizing both alaska and horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic our guests are sensitive to the risk of potential contagion throughout their journey to address these concerns we partnered with health and safety experts to build our nextlevel care initiative the initiative added nearly 100 measures through all stages of travel aimed at educating and helping our guests and employees to stay safe and to build confidence in flying 

• fares and ancillary services 

ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing 78 of total seats one of our advantages is that we offer low fares and a premium value product and experience however given the large concentration of industry capacity some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time we will defend our 

position in our core markets and if necessary adjust capacity to better match supply with demand our strong financial position and low cost advantage have historically enabled us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders 

  

• customer service and reputation 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance and guest amenities  including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort all mainline aircraft in operating service have our refreshed interior configuration which provides our guests with one consistent experience across the fleet we also began installing nextgeneration gogo® inflight satellitebased wifi on our entire boeing and airbus fleets in 2018 which is now planned to be completed in early 2022 

our employees are a critical element of our reputation we have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard we heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest satisfaction 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools we expect that the advancement and increased utilization of these tools will eliminate the need for some businessrelated travel 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

• direct to customer  selling direct at alaskaaircom is less expensive than other channels we believe direct sales through this channel are preferable from a branding and customer relationship standpoint because we can establish ongoing communication with the guest and tailor offers accordingly as a result we prioritize efforts that drive more business to our website 

  

• traditional and online travel agencies  both traditional and online travel agencies typically use global distribution systems to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline many large corporate customers require us to use these agencies some of our competitors rely on this distribution channel to a lesser extent than we do and as a result may have lower ticket distribution costs 

  

• reservation call centers  our call centers are located in phoenix az seattle wa and boise id we generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers 

our sales by channel are as follows 



seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in typical years our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel although pretax profits have not fully recovered to precovid levels seasonal fluctuations began to return to precovid patterns as demand recovered in 2021 aided by the widespread availability of covid19 vaccines in the second quarter however due to relatively weaker business travel recovery and volatility from new covid variants seasonal fluctuations have not fully normalized in a typical year some of the impacts of seasonality are offset by travel from the west coast to leisure destinations like hawaii and costa rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern us seasonality and operational fluctuations are not predictable in the current environment and may be permanently changed postpandemic 

in a typical year in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

• pricing initiatives by us or our competitors 

• changes in fuel costs 

• increases in competition at our primary airports 

• general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand 

  

• increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs and 

• air space and air traffic control delays particularly in seattle and san francisco 

  

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

sustainability initiatives 

taking responsibility for our impact on the environment is an integral part of delivering value for all those who depend on us – employees guests owners and communities to that end we are focused on mitigating or reducing our most significant environmental impacts our sustainability goals are anchored by our commitment to reduce our carbon emissions in 2021 we announced new short and longterm targets with the ultimate goal of reaching netzero carbon emissions by 2040 our roadmap for achieving this goal includes the following focus areas 

• renewing our fleet with more efficient airplanes  alaska received 11 boeing 7379 aircraft in 2021 and has firm commitments to take 82 more alaska also has options for 52 additional 7379 aircraft these aircraft will provide improved fuel efficiency compared to the aircraft they are slated to replace and enable fuelefficient growth as well alaska has also partnered with boeing on the 7379 ecodemonstrator program which tests advanced technologies designed to enhance the safety and sustainability of air travel 

• using sustainable aviation fuel  among currently available technologies sustainable aviation fuel has the greatest potential for enabling nearterm progress towards our netzero emissions goal alaska has joined other carriers at seattle tacoma international airport and san francisco international airport to establish a pathway to commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel expanding use of sustainable aviation fuel also depends on its reliable availability to this end we are partnered with others in the aviation community to identify and develop new sources of production 

• increasing operational efficiency  alaska and horizon take pride in consistently delivering topofindustry operational performance alaskas use of required navigational performance aids in reducing emissions through providing more direct approaches and reducing weatherrelated diversions alaska was also the first in the industry to 

adopt flyways ai a technology which leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize air traffic and enable more fuelefficient flight paths for aggregate savings of fuel carbon emissions and time 

• increasing the use of electric or alternative power  in 2021 we launched and funded alaska star ventures llc an investment arm with a primary focus on identifying and funding companies working on emerging green technologies alaska also announced a collaboration with zeroavia to begin development on a hydrogenelectric powertrain engine capable of flying regional aircraft in excess of 500 nautical miles in 2021 alaska star ventures funded 5 million and has goals to contribute an additional 33 million of cash and inkind investments through 2028 alaska and horizon also continue to expand the use of electric ground equipment at airports 

• harnessing carbon offset technology  to close any remaining gaps on the path to netzero we have partnered with industry experts to identify and vet credible highquality carbon offsetting technologies 

in alignment with our sustainability goals we joined the climate pledge in 2021 an amazonled initiative to limit emissions that includes more than 200 companies also in 2021 we included a carbon emissions metric in our companywide performancebased pay program as we believe it is important to embed these critical targets into the incentives that align all of our employees 

aside from our commitments to reducing our airlines carbon footprint we also recognize the impact our operation has in generating waste in 2018 we were the first us airline to remove plastic straws and stir sticks from our aircraft and in 2019 we launched a campaign called fillbeforeyoufly to engage our employees and guests in reducing plastic waste in 2021 we expanded inflight sustainability efforts by trading plastic water bottles and cups for plantbased cartons and recyclable paper cups alaska leads the industry in inflight recycling and continues to evaluate new ways to further reduce inflight waste 

human capital 

our people 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2021 we employed 22833 17054 at alaska 3494 at horizon and 2285 at mcgee air services active employees of those employees 90 are fulltime and 10 are parttime wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 56 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2021 and 47 in 2020 

most major airlines including alaska and horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized workforces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized workforces those with unionized workforces may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly in response to new competition or slowing demand at december 31 2021 labor unions represented 86 of alaska’s 50 of horizon’s and 87 of mcgee air services employees 

our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under the rla collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2021 were as follows 

a negotiations with alpa for an updated collective bargaining agreement are ongoing as of the date of this filing in september 2021 alaska airlines engaged the national mediation board to assist in negotiations 

b as a result of amendments to mexican labor laws the company has up to four years to make changes to the existing labor agreements during that time the existing contracts remain in place 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2021 were as follows 

a negotiations with amfa for an updated collective bargaining agreement began in november 2021 horizon and amfa reached a tentative agreement in january 2022 voting on which remains open as of the date of this filing 

mcgee air services union contract at december 31 2021 was as follows 

with the dramatic decline in demand we experienced in 2020 our workforce was larger than necessary to support our operational and business needs to help stabilize the business we utilized temporary workforce reduction mechanisms including earlyout and voluntary leave programs which were available to all frontline work groups we also offered incentive leaves to alaska pilots and mechanics as demand significantly rebounded in late spring 2021 alaska began recalling employees from leave programs prior to their intended expiry with all employees on leave returned to active employment by october 2021 

alaska and horizon invest in employee programs and training that aid advancement throughout the company our pilot pathways program provides a clear and direct path for horizon pilots to progress to mainline flying has advanced 263 pilots since inception in 2018 in 2021 we also created an internal maintenance technician development program which will provide eligible employees with financial assistance to enhance and develop skills with the goal of becoming a certified maintenance technician providing meaningful advancement opportunities to employees throughout air group is important and we continue to evaluate new programs which support our people and advance our longterm strategic goals 

diversity equity and inclusion 

at alaska and horizon we believe that every person deserves respect regardless of race ethnicity capability age gender or sexual orientation we are committed to advancing equity in all forms and have set specific and measurable goals to deliver on our commitments to racial equity and diversity by 2025 our primary goals in this arena are to increase racial diversity in our leadership team and build a culture of inclusion for all employees 

we are also working with existing partners such as united negro college fund uncf to create career pathways for at least 175000 young people as a reflection of the importance of these commitments a portion of longterm executive compensation has been tied to achievement of these goals 

community involvement 

alaska and horizon are dedicated to actively supporting the communities we serve in 2021 air group companies donated 11 million in cash and inkind travel to approximately 900 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 21000 hours of community service related to youth and education medical research and transportation our cargo business also provided critical support to communities in need by transporting essential goods and shipments of covid19 vaccines throughout the state of alaska 

the alaska airlines foundation the foundation also provides grants to nonprofits that offer educational and careerdevelopment programs to young people organizations are invited to apply biannually for grants ranging from 5000 to 20000 with preference given to organizations that can demonstrate partnership and longterm program sustainability since inception in 1999 the foundation has donated more than 3 million in grants including nearly 260000 in 2021

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the transportation security administration tsa and the faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

• dot a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates while airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the dot has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities essential air service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes international treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the us and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights the dot has been active in implementing a variety of consumer protection regulations covering subjects such as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the dot for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

• faa the faa through federal aviation regulations fars generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls periodically the faa issues airworthiness directives ads that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations all airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the faa from time to time for alleged violations of fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

• tsa airlines serving the us must operate a tsaapproved aircraft operator standard security program aossp and comply with tsa security directives sds and regulations under tsa authority we are required to collect a september 11 security fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the tsa for alleged violations of the aossp 

sds or security regulations we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the rla to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety and health programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

environmental 

  

we are also subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters both domestically and internationally domestic regulations that have an impact to our operations include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act resource conservation and recovery act clean water act safe drinking water act the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act the national environmental policy act including environmental justice emergency planning and community righttoknow act and the toxic substances control act many state and local environmental regulations exceed these federal regulations in the future we expect there to be incremental legislation aimed at further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions hazardous substances and additional focus on environmental justice 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

the domestic us airline industry committed to carbon neutral growth starting in 2020 through this commitment we have joined participation in the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia a global marketbased emissions offset program issued by the international civil aviation organization to be carbon neutral for international growth as a result of the covid19 pandemic the growth baseline year was modified and set to 2019 during the initial phase this does not have a direct impact on domestic flights however the epa finalized a rule in 2020 on aircraft emission standards which aligns with the international agreements additional commitments to decarbonize through the paris climate accord and domestic carbon neutrality remain a potential impact to our industry 

at this time we do not currently anticipate adverse financial impacts from any specific existing or pending environmental regulation or reporting requirements new regulations related to our existing or past operations or compliance issues could harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

 item 1a risk factors tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterprisewide risks align to the risk factors discussed below 

covid19 

the global pandemic caused by covid19 and related measures implemented to combat its spread has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations financial position and liquidity 

in late 2019 an outbreak of novel coronavirus and its resulting disease covid19 was detected in wuhan china since that time covid19 has spread rapidly throughout the globe including within the united states where millions of cases have been positively diagnosed to date although travel restrictions and stayathome orders have largely been lifted following the rollout of vaccination programs the rise of new variants has led to volatility in bookings and overall demand for air travel this volatility coupled with low recovery of business travel had and continues to have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations additionally o ur operations have been and may continue to be negatively affected if our employees or vendor partners are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to covid19 

in response to the pandemic we implemented and continue to refine and adjust a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impacts on our business this strategy may itself have negative impacts on our business and operations our strategies for encouraging air travel may continue to evolve in response to emerging variants these new strategies may require further investment and if not successful may not generate related revenues to offset these costs one such action is the elimination of change fees for first and main cabin fares and the ability to rebook travel for an extended period beyond standard rebooking terms the loss of change fee revenue combined with ongoing significant ticket cancellation activity has adversely impacted our revenues and liquidity 

at this time we are unable to predict what impact the pandemic will have on future customer behavior new variants particularly those which are vaccineresistant may result in further variability in advance booking and refund activity the recovery of business travel may be impacted by widespread use of video conferencing or the reduction of business travel budgets in addition the company has incurred and will continue to incur covid19 related costs in response to the need for higher staffing levels as well as for enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among employees and guests these contingencies individually and in the aggregate could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we have accepted certain conditions by accepting funding under the payroll support program of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act 

the cares act was signed into law on march 27 2020 providing us airlines and related businesses the ability to access liquidity in the form of grants loans loan guarantees and other investments by the us government 

in 2020 and 2021 the company alaska horizon and mcgee entered agreements with the united states department of the treasury treasury to secure approximately 23 billion of funding under the cares act payroll support program psp and two related extensions of total funding 600 million is in the form of an unsecured senior term loan payable over ten years psp proceeds were used exclusively for employee payroll and benefits expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the psp agreements and the applicable provisions of the cares act 

in addition to repayment commitments we remain subject to the following conditions under our cares act agreements 

• the company may not repurchase its common stock or pay dividends on its common stock until october 1 2022 

• compensation and severance payments for officers and employees who earned more than 425000 in total compensation in 2019 will be subject to maximum limitations through april 1 2023 and 

• the company must maintain certain internal controls and records and provide any additional reporting required by the us government 

these conditions may adversely affect the company’s profitability our ability to negotiate favorable terms with loyalty partners our attractiveness to investors and our ability to compensate at marketcompetitive levels and retain key personnel 

mandatory vaccination programs could have a material adverse impact on the companys operations and financial results 

the presidents executive order dated september 9 2021 requires employees of government contractors to be fully vaccinated against covid19 alaska airlines and horizon air are government contractors by virtue of their agreements with the us government for the carriage of passengers and mail among other activities mcgee air services is subject to the executive order as a subcontractor of alaska airlines as of the date of this filing the executive order is subject to unsettled legal challenges and its legality must be upheld in the judicial system prior to its enforcement by the government should the executive order be upheld in its current form employers may excuse employees from the vaccination requirement only with a valid medical or religious exemption alaska horizon and mcgee operate in highly competitive job markets in which the pool of available employees is limited our companies contractors and vendor partners whose services we rely on to run our operation may lose current or prospective employees because individuals decline to be vaccinated if our companies contractors and vendor partners cannot fill job vacancies with other qualified workers operational disruption and associated negative impact to guests and our financial results could result if we cannot comply with the scope andor timing of the executive order or similar state mandates we could lose business and revenues associated with our government contracts 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our company by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives this would harm our business 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

factors that might impact our operations include 

• contagious illness and fear of contagion 

• congestion construction space constraints at airports andor air traffic control problems all of which many restrict flow 

• adverse weather conditions 

• lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc 

  

• increased security measures or breaches in security 

  

• changes in international treaties concerning air rights 

• international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity 

• interference by modernized telecommunications equipment with aircraft navigation technology and 

• other changes in business conditions 

due to the concentration of our flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on vendors for certain critical activities and sourcing which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases 

  

we rely on vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing among others 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised for reasons such as supply chain delays or workforce shortages replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

impacts of climate change including legal regulatory or market responses may have a material adverse result on our operations andor financial position 

concerns regarding climate change including the impacts of a gradual increase in global temperatures leading to more severe weather conditions continue to rise increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could cause significant and prolonged impacts to our operation or disrupt our supply chain these disruptions may result in increased operating costs and lost revenue should we be unable to operate our published schedules 

many aspects of our operation are subject to increasing regulations governing environmental change increased governmental regulation involving aircraft emissions and environmental investigation and remediation costs coupled with public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may require us to make significant investments in emerging and yet unproven technologies should these technologies not gain approval for use in our operation our results of operations may be adversely impacted and we may be required to direct new investments to different technologies failure to comply with increasing regulation or in addressing the concerns of our guests and our shareholders may adversely impact financial position our results of operations or our stock price 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that require substantial compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels these initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates these laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs new initiatives with employerfunded costs specifically those impacting washington state could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared to our competitors in recent years the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws particularly in california application of these laws may result in operational disruption increased litigation risk and impact on negotiated labor agreements 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other expenses additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer 

purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business additionally changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance any instances of noncompliance could result in additional fines and fees 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

• significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel 

  

• significantly increase security and insurance costs 

  

• make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive 

  

• increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices 

  

• increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and 

  

• result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa 

  

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition airlines compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key west coast markets this dynamic may be exacerbated by competition among airlines to attract passengers during the recovery from the covid19 pandemic the resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit costreduction goals this is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations 

  

our strategy involves a high concentration of our business in key west coast markets a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle portland and bay area hubs in 2021 passengers to and from seattle portland and the bay area accounted for 82 of our total guests 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing and airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on embraer and de havilland additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type as a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods additionally if effects of the ongoing economic recovery andor supply chain backlog causes our limited vendors to have performance problems reduced or ceased operations bankruptcies workforce shortages or other events causing them to be unable to fulfill their commitments to us our operations and business could be materially adversely affected 

should these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft we may not be able to grow our fleet at intended rates which could impact our financial position boeing has significant production constraints for the 7379 aircraft which may impact the timing of deliveries if we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner our growth plans could be negatively impacted additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers this could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including an expanded relationship with american these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights refer to item 1 above for details regarding these codeshare agreements in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our loyalty program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

our entry into the one world global alliance is expected to provide us with many benefits including the ability to seamlessly connect our guests to more points around the globe as well as better serve corporate partners entry into the alliance may cause us to lose existing codeshare agreements with partners who are not one world members and could limit options to bring non one world carrier partners into our mileage plan program further maintaining an alliance with another us airline may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny failure to appropriately manage these partnerships and alliances could negatively impact future growth plans and our financial position 

we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and will continue to pursue these commercial activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are particularly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as video conferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business including expanded reliance on systems managed or hosted by third parties failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

we heavily depend on automated systems to operate our business this includes our airline reservation system checkin kiosks website telecommunication systems maintenance systems airline operations control systems flight deckroute optimization systems planning and scheduling mobile applications and devices and many other systems these systems require significant investment of employee time and cost for maintenance and upgrades failure to appropriately execute these procedures may result in service disruptions or system failures additionally as part of our commitment to innovation and providing an attractive guest travel experience we invest in new technology to ensure our critical systems are reliable scalable and secure 

we also continue to expand our reliance on third party providers for management or hosting of operational and financial systems should these providers fail to meet established service requirements or provide inadequate technical support we could experience disruptions in our operation ticketing or financial systems additionally all of our automated systems cannot be completely protected against events beyond our control including natural disasters computer viruses cyberattacks other security breaches or telecommunications failures 

substantial or repeated failures or disruptions to any of these critical systems could reduce the attractiveness of our services or cause our guests to do business with another airline disruptions failed implementations untimely or incomplete recovery or a breach of these systems or the data centerscloud infrastructure they run on could result in the loss of important data an increase in our expenses loss of revenue impacts to our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

we continue to monitor emerging technologies including technologies which may have disruptive impacts which are out of our control such as the rollout of 5g wireless service we will continue to work with regulatory agencies and other air carriers to mitigate potential impacts of these technologies on the safety and security of air travel 

failure to appropriately comply with evolving and expanding information security rules and regulations or to safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost 

as part of our core business we are required to collect process store and share personal and financial information from our guests and employees under current or future privacy legislation we are subject to significant legal risk should we not appropriately protect that data our entrance into the one world alliance exposes us to incremental global regulation and therefore risk in addition we continue to expand our reliance on thirdparty software providers and data processors including cloud providers unauthorized access of personal and financial data via fraud or other means of deception could result in data loss theft modification or unauthorized disclosure to the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information experience a data breach fail to appropriately safeguard personal data or are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm further as regulation of the collection and storage of personal and financial information continues to evolve and increase we may incur significant costs to bring our systems and processes into compliance 

cyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations onboard safety reputation and financial condition 

our sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify because of these everevolving risks and regular attacks we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices however the nature of these attacks means that proper policies technical controls and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access emerging cybercrime threats include the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware denial of service or other attacks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could result in substantial costs for response and remediation adversely affect our operations and our reputation and expose us to litigation regulatory enforcement or other legal action a cybersecurity attack impacting our onboard or other operational systems may result in an accident or incident onboard or significant operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation operation and financial position further a significant portion of our office employees have transitioned to remote work which increases our exposure to cyberattacks and could compromise our financial or operational systems 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

we have a significant amount of debt and fixed obligations and have incurred substantial incremental debt in response to the covid19 pandemic these obligations could lead to liquidity restraints and have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

we carry and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt and aircraft operating lease commitments in response to the covid19 pandemic we obtained new financing to fund operations through periods of unprecedented low demand and for the unknown duration of any economic recovery period although we aim to keep our leverage low due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions further should we incur incremental obligations issuers may require future debt agreements to contain more restrictive covenants or require additional collateral beyond historical market terms which may further restrict our ability to successfully access capital 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft 

as of december 31 2021 the average age of our next gen passenger aircraft b737700 800 900 900ers was approximately 109 years the average age of our b7379 was approximately 04 years the average age of our operating a320 and a321neo aircraft was approximately 93 years the average age of our owned e175 aircraft was approximately 36 years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 137 years typically our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in incremental maintenance expense as we are required to return leased planes in a contractually specified condition 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results 

in accordance with acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the virgin america acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually we could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties we can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods any such charges may materially affect our financial results 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

the companys brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media 

we operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media negative publicity including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees or failure to adhere to covid19 related health and safety protocols can spread rapidly through social media should the company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity the companys brand and reputation may be significantly harmed such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results 

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

labor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses in addition to costs associated with represented employee groups labor costs could also increase for nonunionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major us airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market 

ongoing and periodic negotiations with labor unions could result in job actions such as slowdowns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during negotiations although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts the operation could be significantly impacted although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert management’s attention from other projects and issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the inability to attract retain and train qualified personnel or maintain our culture could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we compete against other major us airlines for pilots aircraft technicians and other labor as more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age the us airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage attrition beyond normal levels or the inability to attract new pilots could negatively impact our operating results additionally the industry including related vendor partners has experienced and may continue to experience challenges in hiring and retaining other labor positions such as aircraft technicians ground handling and customer service agents and flight attendants the companys or our vendor partners inability to attract and retain personnel for these positions could negatively impact our operating results which may harm our growth plans additionally we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages or pay increased rates to our vendors to retain these positions this would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our guest experience and financial position 

our success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a unified culture with cohesive values and goals much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty failure to maintain and grow the alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies as part of this process we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs

year in review 

business recovery 

our 2021 financial performance demonstrates the strength of our business model and our ability to adapt while facing uneven recovery from the covid19 pandemic with the widespread availability of vaccines and the relaxation of local restrictions in many of the markets we serve customer demand for air travel increased dramatically in late spring 2021 for the full year we recorded revenues of 62 billion 70 of 2019 levels on 79 of our 2019 capacity despite volatility caused by the rise of new variants our measured return of capacity coupled with solid cost control and operational performance enabled us to return to adjusted pretax profitability in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 although we recorded an adjusted net loss for the full year of 256 million profitability in the second half of the year indicates our approach to recovery has largely been successful 

with our business stabilizing we generated 138 million in operating cash flow excluding 892 million in grants received from the cares payroll support program with our midyear return to profitability and early return to positive cash flow generation we were well positioned to begin utilizing excess onhand liquidity to pay down debt and repair our balance sheet in 2021 we repaid 13 billion in debt offset by 363 million in issuances which lowered our debttocapitalization ratio to 49 marking a 12 point improvement from december 31 2020 additionally we made a 100 million voluntary pension contribution payment to the defined benefit plan for alaskas pilots bringing our pension status to 98 funded at year end balance sheet strength combined with our operational model has been critical to our past success and we believe we are well positioned exiting 2021 to again capitalize on these as we prepare for growth 

see results of operations below for further discussion 

outlook 

our improving financial results and wellmanaged balance sheet provide a strong foundation for the next phase of recovery we remain committed to returning capacity in a measured way and will align our ongoing network restoration with the continued return of demand we expect to be back to 2019 flying levels by summer 2022 and to grow our airlines from there in the back half of the year 

recent demand setbacks and operational disruptions stemming from the omicron variant are reflected in our first quarter expectations while january was acutely impacted bookings for presidents day and beyond remain strong in response to these conditions we scaled back our first quarter capacity plans as a result in q1 2022 we expect to fly approximately 10 to 13 below the same period in 2019 and expect total revenue to be 14 to 17 below the same period in 2019 our unit costs for the period are expected to be up 15 to 18 versus 2019 with 7 points of pressure attributable to lower than expected levels of flying given the recent schedule adjustments 

for full year 2022 we expect capacity to increase 2 to 6 versus 2019 dependent on demand this guidance reflects first half capacity that is flat to slightly up and second half capacity that could be as much as 10 higher versus 2019 

throughout the pandemic we have stated our commitment to returning to 2019 unit costs levels even if we were to remain a smaller airline for some time while we no longer expect to be a smaller airline as signaled by our growth plans in the back half of the year we are still fundamentally committed to returning to our precovid cost performance for the full year we expect casmex to be up 3 to 6 versus 2019 levels which includes the impact of lease return costs associated with our airbus aircraft excluding those costs we expect casmex to be up 1 to 3 versus 2019 this guidance implies we will return to our precovid cost levels in the second half of 2022 

the guidance we have provided and our outlook more broadly are sensitive to health trends exposure to variants of the covid19 virus and regulations and restrictions imposed by state local and federal authorities our plans will be responsive to emerging information and the guidance we have provided is subject to greater uncertainty than we have historically experienced our people continue to focus on keeping costs low running a great operation and welcoming guests back to travel with nextlevel care to ensure they are safe and comfortable when they fly these are competitive advantages we have cultivated over many years that will continue to serve us well in 2022 and beyond we are confident that we are prepared to meet the challenges ahead and that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger and more resilient airline 

results of operations 

adjusted nongaap results and pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of the payroll support program wage offset special items marktomarket gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because 

• by excluding fuel expense and certain special items including the payroll support program wage offset impairment and restructuring charges and mergerrelated costs from our unit metrics we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations as we focus on costreduction initiatives emerging from the covid19 pandemic our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs so even a small reduction in nonfuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results in addition we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run so it is important for management and thus investors to understand the impact of and trends in companyspecific cost drivers such as productivity airport costs maintenance costs etc which are more controllable by management 

• cost per asm casm excluding fuel and certain special items such as the payroll support program wage offset impairment and restructuring charges and mergerrelated costs is one of the most important measures used by management and by our board of directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance 

• casm excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they have historically compared our airline to others in the industry the measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors 

• adjusted income before income tax and other items as specified in our plan documents is an important metric for the employee annual cash incentive plan which covers the majority of employees within the alaska air group organization 

• disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items we believe that disclosing the impact of these items as noted above is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines 

• although we disclose our unit revenues we do not nor are we able to evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the midtolong term although we believe it is useful to evaluate nonfuel unit costs for the reasons noted above we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

2021 compared with 2020 

our consolidated net income for 2021 was 478 million or 377 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 13 billion or 1072 per share in 2020 

excluding the impact of the payroll support program wage offset special items and marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments our adjusted consolidated net loss for 2021 was 256 million or 203 per share compared to an adjusted consolidated net loss of 13 billion or 1017 per share in 2020 the following table reconciles our adjusted net loss per share eps during the full year 2021 and 2020 to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap 



casmex is reconciled to casm below 

operating statistics summary unaudited 

below are operating statistics we use to measure performance 

a except for ftes data includes information related to thirdparty regional capacity purchase flying arrangements 

b see reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly related gaap measure in the accompanying pages 

c data presented includes information related to flights operated by horizon and thirdparty carriers 

d excludes all aircraft removed from operating service 

given the unusual nature of 2020 we believe that some analysis of specific financial and operational results compared to 2019 provides meaningful insight the table below includes comparative results from 2021 to 2019 



operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased 26 billion or 73 during 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the changes are summarized in the following table 

passenger revenue 

on a consolidated basis passenger revenue for 2021 increased by 25 billion or 82 on a 41 increase in capacity and an 18 point increase in load factor recovery from the pandemic is the driver of these changes as demand for travel increased in 2021 primarily led by leisure travelers there were setbacks to the improvement late in the fourth quarter as absenteeism driven by the omicron variant and severe winter weather on the west coast led to canceled flights and lost passenger revenue 

we anticipate passenger revenue for 2022 will increase as compared to 2021 consistent with our overall growth plan although we face headwinds in the first quarter due to continuing impacts of the omicron variant we anticipate full year capacity will grow 2 to 6 versus 2019 

mileage plan other revenue 

on a consolidated basis mileage plan other revenue increased 87 million or 23 as compared to 2020 largely due to an increase in commission revenue from our affinity card partner stemming from growing consumer spend and an increase in cardholders 

cargo and other 

on a consolidated basis cargo and other revenue increased 43 million or 25 from 2020  the increase is primarily due to the return of all three freighters back to full capacity in the second quarter of 2021 coupled with increased belly cargo activity on increased scheduled departures 

we expect that our cargo revenues will increase in 2022 as compared to 2021 on a full year of freighter capacity and incremental belly cargo availability as we increase our capacity 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased 150 million or 3 compared to 2020 we consider it useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 

significant operating expense variances from 2020 are more fully described below 

fuel expense 

aircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense can be volatile because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense increased 556 million or 77 compared to 2020 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



the raw fuel price per gallon increased 37 due to higher west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel increased fuel costs were also driven by a 42 increase in gallons consumed compared to 2020 consistent with a 41 increase in capacity 

gains recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 57 million in 2021 compared to losses of 18 million in 2020 these amounts represent cash received from settled hedges offset by cash paid for the premium cost on related call options 

we expect our economic fuel cost per gallon in the first quarter of 2022 to range between 245 and 250 per gallon based on current market west coast jet fuel prices 

nonfuel expenses 

the table below provides the reconciliation of the operating expense line items excluding fuel the payroll support program wage offset and special items significant operating expense variances from 2020 are more fully described below 



wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased during 2021 by 165 million or 8 compared to 2020 excluding the impact of the payroll support program wage offset the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 

wages and payroll taxes increased by a combined 172 million or 10 on a 10 increase in ftes increased ftes as compared to the prior period are primarily the result of pilots and employees returning from leaves of absence and incentive lines accepted in 2020 higher wage rates from incentives paid to certain employees in the summer and holiday periods in response to increasing demand were largely offset by a lower average wage rate from the growth in newly hired employees who have a lower wage base than more senior employees 

we expect wages and benefits expense to be higher in 2022 compared to 2021 given our expected growth in overall ftes needed to support our expected capacity growth our guidance does not include the impacts of any future agreements we may reach in 2022 most notably with our mainline pilots whose contract became amendable in april 2020 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased to 151 million in 2021 from 130 million in 2020 the increase is primarily due to higher payouts achieved under the performance based pay plan by meeting or exceeding certain cash flow safety emissions and productivity targets 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased by 43 million compared to 2020 the increase is primarily due to increased component repairs which were deferred in 2020 as well as increased powerbythehour expense driven by increased utilization of covered aircraft 

we expect aircraft maintenance expense to be higher in 2022 due to increased aircraft utilization and expected lease return costs that are expected to be incurred over the next 24 to 36 months as we prepare to return airbus aircraft to lessors 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense decreased 45 million or 15 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of full impairment taken on certain leased airbus aircraft in 2020 

we expect aircraft rent to increase in 2022 on the annualization of expense and incremental deliveries of leased 7379 aircraft as well as incremental skywest lease deliveries 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased 138 million or 33 compared to 2020 primarily due to a significant increase in departures combined with increased rates at certain of our hub airports 

we expect landing fees and other rental expense to increase in 2022 as we continue to increase capacity and departures across our network combined with higher rates at many of our hub airports 

contracted services 

contracted services increased by 54 million or 30 compared to 2020 primarily driven by increased departures and passengers at stations where we outsource our ground operations 

we expect contracted services to increase in 2022 as we continue to increase capacity and departures throughout our network 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased by 72 million or 71 compared to 2020 primarily driven by a significant increase in distribution costs and credit card commissions stemming from increased revenues increased marketing spend and sponsorship costs related to the return of professional sports and events also contributed to the yearoveryear increase 

we expect selling expense to increase in 2022 due primarily to higher sales as demand for air travel returns and an increase in marketing costs as we expand our network 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service increased by 49 million or 54 compared to 2020 consistent with the overall increase in revenue passengers as well as the return and expansion of many of our onboard products in 2021 

we expect food and beverage service to increase in 2022 as we continue to increase capacity and departures throughout our network and return to full service aboard our aircraft 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest under our cpa agreements increased 19 million or 15 in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase in expense is primarily due to increases in departures flown by skywest as compared to the prioryear period offset by the final pass through of cares act psp funding for skywest pilot and flight attendant wages 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to be higher in 2022 on the addition of 10 aircraft flown by skywest under a cpa 

other expense 

other expense increased 100 million or 25 compared to 2020 primarily driven by incremental crew hotel stays and per diem consistent with the overall increase in departures and capacity as well as additional expense for professional services 

we expect other expense to increase in 2022 as we increase departures and hire more employees resulting in incremental crew costs 

special items  impairment charges 

we recorded an impairment benefit of 1 million in 2021 the benefit consisted of adjustments associated with leased aircraft that have been retired and removed from the operating fleet but not yet returned to the lessor we continue to evaluate total estimated costs to return these permanently parked aircraft and make updates to total expense when necessary 

special items  restructuring charges 

we recorded a restructuring benefit of 10 million in 2021 primarily as a result of issuing recall notices to pilots on incentive lines for periods earlier than were previously anticipated as all employees expected to return to work have been recalled we do not anticipate further restructuring charges in 2022 

additional segment information 

refer to note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

mainline adjusted pretax loss was 179 million in 2021 compared to adjusted pretax loss of 14 billion in 2020 the 12 billion improvement in pretax loss was driven by a 22 billion increase in mainline operating revenue offset by a 471 million increase in mainline nonfuel operating expense and a 496 million increase in mainline fuel expense 

as compared to the prior year higher mainline revenues are primarily attributable to a 94 increase in traffic on a 46 increase in capacity driven by the recovery seen in demand in 2021 nonfuel operating expenses and fuel expenses rose given the increase in traffic and capacity as well as higher raw fuel prices 

regional 

regional adjusted pretax loss was 210 million in 2021 compared to an adjusted pretax loss of 421 million in 2020 the 211 million improvement in pretax loss was primarily attributable to a 413 million increase in regional operating revenues offset by a 103 million increase in regional nonfuel operating expense and a 99 million increase in regional fuel expense 

as compared to the prior year higher regional revenues are primarily attributable to a 59 increase in traffic on a 17 increase in capacity driven by the recovery seen in demand in 2021 nonfuel operating expenses and fuel expenses rose given the increase in traffic and capacity as well as higher raw fuel prices 

horizon 

horizon achieved an adjusted pretax profit of 12 million in 2021 compared to 41 million in 2020 primarily as a result of higher operating expenses in 2021 the increased expenses were primarily related to flight operations and maintenance costs as the business began to recover during the year 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

improved results and increased demand in 2021 allowed us to begin the process of returning our balance sheet and available liquidity to prepandemic levels during the year we made the following meaningful progress 

• generated positive operating cash flow in excess of 1 billion bolstered by improved advance bookings as demand returns and the receipt of 892 million in payroll support program funding from the us treasury under extensions of cares act programs 

• repaid 13 billion in debt including the termination of the cares act secured loan full repayment of two outstanding lines of credit and prepayment of the 425 million 364day term loan facility 

• decreased debttocapitalization ratio to 49 at december 31 2021 from 61 at december 31 2020 

• made a 100 million voluntary contribution to the defined benefit plan for alaskas pilots boosting estimated combined funded status of all defined benefit plans to 98 and 

• restored pool of unencumbered aircraft in the operating fleet to 42 as of december 31 2021 which could be financed if necessary 

as the business continues to recover to sustained profitability reducing outstanding debt normalizing our onhand liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet remain high priorities we anticipate funding our planned 2022 capital expenditures of 15 billion to 16 billion with cash onhand 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations meet our debt payment obligations and remain in compliance with the financial debt covenants in existing financing arrangements for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of our financial condition and liquidity 



debttocapitalization adjusted for operating leases 

a to best reflect our leverage at december 31 2020 we included the shortterm borrowings stemming from the covid19 pandemic which were classified as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

adjusted net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization special items and rent 

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 1 billion in 2021 compared to net cash used of 234 million in 2020 cash provided by ticket sales is the primary source of our operating cash flow in 2021 we also had material cash inflows of 892 million from the receipt of psp grants our primary use of operating cash flow is for operating expenses including payments for employee wages and benefits payments to suppliers for goods and services and payments to lessors and airport authorities for rents and landing fees operating cash flow also includes payments to or refunds from federal state and local taxing authorities changes in demand that resulted from the pandemic recovery and the changes we made to our operations in response had a dramatic impact on our operating cash flows in 2021 

in 2021 revenues increased 26 billion when compared to 2020 driven by improved demand described more fully below and incremental cash from our affinity card partners on increased miles purchased operating expenses increased 150 million versus prior year driven by significantly higher fuel costs and increased operating costs as we returned capacity to meet demand offset by a reduction of 858 million in noncash impairment and restructuring charges recorded in 2020 

in 2021 air traffic liability atl increased 90 million driven by new ticket purchases primarily at the end of the year offset by credits redeemed for travel although atl was a source of working capital in 2021 as of december 31 2021 the balance includes 234 million in travel credits issued to guests these credits are expected to be redeemed by guests for travel in future periods and will represent a working capital headwind 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1 billion during 2021 compared to 593 million in 2020 increased cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by the 2020 saleleaseback transaction for ten owned a320 aircraft with no comparative transaction in 2021 cash used also increased due to a 70 million increase in capital expenditures as well as net purchases of marketable securities of 706 million in 2021 compared to net purchases of 644 million in 2020 increased net purchases are primarily driven by additional cash on hand from borrowings and the psp which allowed the company to invest additional funds 

cash used in financing activities 

  

cash used in financing activities was 914 million during 2021 compared to net cash provided of 2 billion in 2020 during the year we utilized cash on hand to make 13 billion in debt payments compared to 565 million in the prior year these payments were offset by proceeds from debt issuances of 363 million compared to 26 billion issued in 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic 

  

material cash commitments 

material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

aircraft commitments 

  

as of december 31 2021 alaska has firm orders to purchase 74 boeing 7379 aircraft with deliveries in 2022 through 2024 and firm commitments to lease eight boeing 7379 aircraft with deliveries between 2023 and 2034 alaska also has an agreement with skywest airlines to expand our longterm capacity purchase agreement by three aircraft in 2022 and two aircraft in 2023 horizon also has commitments to purchase seven e175 aircraft with deliveries in 2023 through 2025 alaska has options to acquire up to 52 additional 7379 aircraft and horizon has options to acquire 15 e175 aircraft options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met over the long term 

the following table summarizes our anticipated fleet count by year as of the date of this filing 

a anticipated fleet activity reflects intended early retirement and extensions or replacement of certain leases not all of which have been contracted yet 

b actual fleet at december 31 2021 excluding airbus aircraft that were removed from operating service in 2020 in response to covid19 capacity reductions of these nine have since been returned to service in 2021 and three are planned to return in 2022 

c retirements in 2022 and 2023 are contractual lease expirations of horizon q400 aircraft in each respective year 

d aircraft are either owned or leased by horizon or operated under a capacity purchase agreement with a third party under the terms of our capacity purchase agreement with a third party in 2023 an additional spare aircraft will be leased to support the operational integrity of the network 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through cash flow from operations or longterm debt 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our obligations as of december 31 2021 for agreements with variable terms amounts included reflect our minimum obligations discussion of these obligations follow the table below 

a future minimum lease payments for aircraft includes commitments for aircraft which have been removed from operating service as we have remaining obligations under existing terms 

b includes noncancelable contractual commitments for aircraft and engines buyer furnished equipment and contractual aircraft maintenance obligations 

c for variablerate debt future obligations are shown above using libor forward curve as of december 31 2021 

d primarily comprised of nonaircraft lease costs associated with capacity purchase agreements 

debt obligations and interest obligations 

the company primarily issues debt to fund purchases of aircraft or other capital expenditures in response to the covid19 pandemic in 2020 we issued 26 billion in debt to withstand the downturn and prepare for recovery in 2021 we repaid 13 billion in debt including prepayments of 923 million which was partially offset by issuances of 363 million at december 31 2021 our debt portfolio carries a weighted average interest rate of 33 interest is paid with regular debt service debt service obligations in 2022 is expected to be 456 million inclusive of interest and principal refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our debt and interest balances 

leased aircraft return costs 

for many of our leased aircraft we are required under the contractual terms to return the aircraft in a specified state as a result of these contractual terms we may incur significant costs at the termination of the lease costs of returning leased aircraft are accrued when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable usually beginning at least 12 months prior to the lease return unless the leased asset is removed from operation if the leased aircraft is removed from the operating fleet the estimated cost of return is accrued at the time of removal such estimates are based on the time remaining on the lease planned aircraft usage and the provisions included in the lease agreement although the actual amount due to any lessor upon return may not be known with certainty until lease termination we anticipate recording material expenses and cash outflows to return aircraft beginning in 2022 as all airbus a319 and a320 aircraft are expected to be removed from operating service by 2023 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices usage of net operating losses whether bonus depreciation provisions are available any future tax reform efforts at the federal level as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2021 we made tax payments net of refunds totaling 48 million the company had an effective tax rate of 24 we believe that we have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimate and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

frequent flyer programs 

  

alaskas mileage plan loyalty program awards mileage credits referred to as miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners we also sell services including miles for transportation companion fare™ certificates bag fee waivers and access to our brand and customer lists to major banks that offer alaska cobrand credit cards to a lesser extent miles for transportation are also sold to other nonairline partners such as hotels and car rental agencies outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or eligible airline partners and for nonairline products such as hotels as long as mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide future travel 

mileage credits and the various other services we sell under our loyalty program represent performance obligations that are part of a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement accounting guidance requires that we use a relative standalone selling price model to allocate consideration received to the material performance obligations in these contracts our relative standalone selling price models are refreshed when contracts originate or are materially modified we also update our model annually based on observed volumes 

  

at december 31 2021 we had approximately 301 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate deferred revenue balance of 24 billion the deferred revenue resulting from our relative selling price allocations requires significant management judgment there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or expenses the most significant assumptions are described below 

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold 

  

we estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation including mileage credits by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimate the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables 

2 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel breakage 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem mileage credits for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical and future award redemption patterns 

we review significant mileage plan assumptions on an annual basis or more frequently should circumstances indicate a need and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

  

we have interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases and interest rate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuel hedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil component of jet fuel limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against fuel price increases we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2021 would change the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 132 million or 44 million 

the portfolio value of our fuel hedge contracts was 81 million at december 31 2021 compared to a portfolio value of 15 million at december 31 2020 we did not have any collateral held by counterparties on these agreements as of december 31 2021 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variable rate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have a number of interest rate swaps that fix the interest rates on certain variable rate debt agreements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on average variable rate debt held during 2021 would have correspondingly changed our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 3 million our variable rate debt represents approximately 29 and 53 of our total longterm debt as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 approximately 469 million of the companys total variable rate notes payable were effectively fixed via interest rate swaps at december 31 2021 

our exposure to interest rate variability is further mitigated through our variable rate investment portfolio we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average one point more than they did in 2021 interest income would increase by approximately 23 million 

our variable rate instruments including longterm debt interest rate swaps and credit facilities all make reference to the london interbank offered rate libor as the interest rate benchmark it is expected that in june 2023 libor will be discontinued as a reference rate in the event of the discontinuance of libor we will need to transition our liborbased contracts to a mutually agreedupon alternate benchmark rate which effectively places the lenders and the company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of libor at this time we do not anticipate that the discontinuance of libor will materially impact our liquidity or financial position 

inflationary risk 

inflation in the united states in late 2021 was among the highest it has been in the past 30 years although a large portion of our operating costs are contractual with escalation clauses a portion of our costs are subject to inflationary pressures examples include fuel costs goods and services for which we do not have existing contracts wages for employees airport costs based on cost recovery models and certain vendor costs that include wage increase clauses among others elevated inflation rates for a prolonged period of time without the ability to increase our fares at a similar rate may have a significant impact to our financial results

 item 1 our business tableend

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines alaska and horizon alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of alaska horizon is a washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981 and was acquired by air group in 1986 virgin america was a member of air group from its acquisition in 2016 through 2018 at which time alaska and virgin america combined operating certificates and legally merged into a single entity the company also includes mcgee air services an aviation services provider that was established as a whollyowned subsidiary of alaska in 2016 and other subsidiaries 

alaska and horizon operate as separate airlines with individual business plans competitive factors and economic risks we organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments which are as follows 

• mainline  includes scheduled air transportation on alaskas boeing and airbus jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the us and in parts of mexico and costa rica 

• regional  includes horizons and other thirdparty carriers’ scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the us and canada under capacity purchase agreements cpa this segment includes the actual revenues and expenses associated with regional flying as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by air group on behalf of the regional operations 

• horizon  includes the capacity sold to alaska under a cpa expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs ownership costs and maintenance costs 

together we are the fifth largest airline in the united states offering unparalleled guest service connectivity and schedules from our hub markets along the west coast with our regional partners we fly to more than 115 destinations throughout the united states and north america we have operated in a highly competitive and often challenging industry for over 88 years our top priority as an airline is ensuring the safety of our guests and employees an area that we have continued to invest in during 2020 despite the significant financial challenges we encountered our success over many decades and resilience in difficult times is attributable to our people business model and commitment to sustainable growth over the longterm 

2020 was a year of uncertainty and challenge the impact of the pandemic stemming from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid19 presented us with the greatest financial challenge in our history travel restrictions and stayathome orders coupled with the closure of many popular destinations and the cancellation of major events drove demand for air travel to historic lows in the spring of 2020 although we have seen modest improvement since that time including improved booking activity at the end of 2020 and in early 2021 demand remains well below historical levels 

in response to reduced demand we acted quickly to preserve cash by reducing flying across our network and removing fixed and discretionary costs to the greatest extent possible we also prepared for a potentially long recovery period by accessing 5 billion in liquidity including private placement offerings government funding bank debt and the sale of ten airbus aircraft part of the government funding received was through the payroll support program of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act which provided critical support to enable us to preserve jobs and continue to provide an essential service to the communities we serve although our debt balances have increased our cash preservation efforts were effective and our adjusted net debt at the end of 2020 is substantially unchanged from the end of 2019 protecting the health of our balance sheet has positioned us well for the recovery that is expected in 2021 and beyond 

we took action early in the pandemic to ensure a safe environment for guests and our employees we launched our nextlevel care initiative which includes over 100 safety measures that have been and will continue to be vital to restoring guest confidence in travel onboard our aircraft to provide peace of mind in guests travel decisions we also eliminated change fees for first class or main cabin itineraries and we extended the expiry of outstanding travel credits to december 31 2021 

although the pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our business we have attempted to reduce its effect on our employees where possible to minimize the need for involuntary furloughs we instituted earlyout and voluntary leave programs which were accepted by 3900 employees additionally we aligned the focus of our 22000 employees on reducing cash burn and delivering a safe travel experience for guests by creating an incentive program designed to supplement our traditional performancebased pay and operational performance programs through these programs our employees earned 130 million in incentive pay in 2020 we strongly believe that aligning employees under common goals makes our company better 

and expect that alaska and horizon will be among the only airlines in the us to provide generous incentive payments for employees in 2020 

in spite of the difficult year alaska and horizon continued to actively support the communities we serve in 2020 air group companies donated 10 million in cash and inkind travel to over 900 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 17000 hours of community service related to youth and education medical research and transportation our cargo business also provided critical support to communities in need by transporting essential goods and shipments of covid19 vaccines throughout the state of alaska 

as we look forward we know that our business is dependent on getting guests flying again and getting our people and assets back to work now that the the initial response to the pandemic is largely behind us we have shifted our attention toward recovery as we prepare for the return in demand over the next several months as the recovery ensues our focus areas include the following 

capturing demand for travel 

capturing the demand that exists for travel will be vital to our recovery in 2020 the rebound in leisure travel was much more robust than business travel and we expect to see that trend continue in 2021 to capture that leisure demand we announced 30 new routes in 2020 aimed at connecting our guests to warmweather and outdoor recreation locations to further reduce travel friction we have worked with health partners and local governments to implement processes to meet locallymandated travel requirements in december 2020 in partnership with the state of hawaii government alaska was the first airline to launch a preclearance program to hawaii providing our guests with a seamless travel experience and allowing them to bypass screening upon arrival we expect these preclearance programs to mature in 2021 and believe they will aid overall recovery and willingness of travelers to fly 

we believe marketing to guests who may soon return to travel and ensuring they are familiar with our safety initiatives is key to capturing demand as it returns toward the end of 2020 we launched several campaigns encouraging guests to book future travel our lets go campaign emphasized the layers of safety we have put in place and our friends and family discount program engaged our employees in reaching out to guests these promotions and others like them stimulated bookings and the results have served as an encouraging indicator that our guests are eager to return to travel in 2021 

in 2020 we announced the west coast international alliance wcia with american airlines inc american which will provide more destinations greater utility and more value for our guests and loyalty members the alliance will allow alaska mileage plan members to enjoy benefits across both airlines by early spring 2021 in conjunction with our partnership with american we accepted a formal invitation to join the one world® global alliance with entry expected on march 31 2021 alaska mileage plan tm members will have significantly expanded benefits in the one world program including reciprocal tier status in one world as well as the ability to earn and use miles to reach more than 1000 destinations worldwide the wcia and one world enhances alaskas presence globally and will position us to capture an incremental share of global travelers and corporate accounts as recovery begins to take shape 

reducing our cost structure and strengthening our balance sheet 

maintaining a low cost structure has been critical to our past success and we believe it will be even more important in the recovery ahead in 2020 we reduced our adjusted nonfuel operating costs by 13 billion or 22 from 2019 through reductions in flying and minimizing discretionary expenditures as we return aircraft to service and build capacity in recovery we are focused on returning to 2019 unit cost levels excluding fuel and special items even if we are a smaller company to this end we have identified over 250 million in structural cost savings initiatives that we began to realize in the fourth quarter of 2020 which will continue to ramp through 2021 having low costs when demand returns will enable us to return to profitability more quickly and will lead to positive cash flow generation this in turn will enable us to begin repaying the debt that we have taken on which is foundational for our future growth additionally exiting 2020 with adjusted net debt that is largely flat as compared to the prior year means that we have cash on hand that can be used to pay down debt when we believe we are in a stable recovery 

in late 2020 alaska announced an agreement in principle with boeing to restructure and grow the existing boeing 737 max max aircraft purchase agreement as part of this restructuring alaska renegotiated the terms of its aircraft order with boeing which will expand the total firm aircraft to 55 to be delivered between 2021 and 2024 with options to purchase an additional 52 aircraft with delivery between 2023 and 2026 alaska also announced an agreement with air lease corporation to obtain an additional 13 leased max aircraft with deliveries between 2021 and 2022 bringing total firm deliveries of max aircraft to 68 by 2024 this will allow us to replace airbus a319 and a320 aircraft that will be returned off lease over the next 

few years further this agreement provides the flexibility to align our growth with the demand environment shifting substantially to a single mainline fleet that is more efficient profitable and sustainable will help support our overall longterm goals 

we have a long track record of disciplined cost control and balance sheet management and we will continue to aggressively manage both as we navigate through and exit the covid19 pandemic

alaska airlines mileage plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 17 airline partners by using an alaska airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program through alaska and our global partners mileage plan™ members have access to a large network of over 800 worldwide travel destinations further members can receive up to 50000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on alaska airlines purchases alaska airlines visa signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the us and platinum and world elite mastercard cardholders in canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to six people traveling on the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or our partner airlines for hotel stays via mileageplanhotelscom or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines we believe all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value than competing programs 

mileage plan™ revenues including those in the passenger revenue income statement line item represented approximately 20 of air groups total revenues in 2020 mileage plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers keeping existing customers actively engaged and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements frequent flyer agreements enable our mileage plan tm members to earn mileage credits and make redemptions on one of our 17 domestic and international partner airlines 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a blockspace arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing a more diverse network and schedule options to our guests 

alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities on march 31 2021 alaska intends to join the one world alliance upon entry mileage plan elite members will receive one world status which enables the benefits of tier status recognition and eligible benefits across all 13 one world member airlines providing access to over 1000 destinations 

alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

• offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage credit and redemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on us and international airline partners 

• providing a consistent and seamless guest experience when you are flying on alaska or one of our partners 

  

• giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and 

  

• providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs 

  

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time our codeshare and interline agreements generated 3 5 and 5 of our total marketed revenues as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

a comprehensive summary of alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows 



a these airlines do not have their own frequent flyer program however alaskas mileage plan tm members can earn and redeem miles on these airlines route systems 

cargo and other revenue 

the company provides freight and mail services cargo the majority of cargo services are provided to commercial businesses and the united states postal service the company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination or is transferred to a thirdparty carrier for delivery 

the company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships hotel and car commissions and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as cargo and other revenue 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to potentially volatile business cycles resulting from factors such as a global pandemic economic conditions volatile fuel prices a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic presented the airline industry one of the greatest challenges in the history of aviation in response to the various stayathome orders local restrictions and general uncertainty regarding air travel usbased airlines reduced domestic capacity when compared to 2019 by 75 although it is uncertain when the impacts of the pandemic will subside competition to capture existing demand for travel in the interim is expected to be intense 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly impacted by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel aircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense or the price that we generally pay at the airport including taxes and fees plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 14 to 25 of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the us 

the price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years has ranged from a low of 39 per barrel in 2020 to a high of 65 in 2018 for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 11 million of fuel cost annually based on 2020 consumption levels said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 5 million per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years over the last five years average annual west coast refining margin prices have fluctuated from a low of 11 per barrel in 2020 to a high of 26 per barrel in 2019 

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased 29 in 2020 after decreasing 6 in 2019 and increasing 28 in 2018 

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



a includes information for virgin america for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 

b other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs 

we use crude oil call options as hedges against our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our price for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of declines in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft and executing on operational best practices are the best hedges against high fuel prices maintaining a young fuelefficient fleet helps to reduce our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry can be intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta air lines inc delta who has significantly increased its capacity in seattle since 2013 approximately 75 of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta as we have grown in california and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings united airlines and southwest airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve our california and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the pacific northwest although competitive capacity is expected to be down significantly in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 given the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we expect once demand returns that we will face strong competition in all of our primary markets 

we believe that the following competitive factors matter to guests when making an air travel purchase decision 

  

• safety and guest health 

safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do in 2021 alaska was again ranked by airlineratingscom as the safest us airline in the top 20 safest airlines in the world in 2020 we also received our 19th diamond award of excellence from the federal aviation administration faa recognizing both alaska and horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training 

in 2020 our guests were acutely focused on the risk of potential contagion throughout their journey in response we partnered with health and safety experts to build our nextlevel care initiative in doing so we have added nearly 100 measures through all stages of travel aimed at educating and helping our guests and employees to stay safe and to build confidence in flying for our efforts we received diamond level certification from the airline passenger experience association in 2020 for the health and safety standards we implemented 

• fares and ancillary services 

ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing 79 of total seats one of our advantages is that we offer low fares and a premium value product and experience however given the large concentration of industry capacity some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time we will defend our position in our core markets and if necessary adjust capacity to better match supply with demand our strong financial position and low cost advantage have historically enabled us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders 

  

• customer service and reputation 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance and guest amenities  including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort in the fourth quarter of 2020 alaska and horizon were among the top in the industry for ontime performance 

all mainline aircraft in operating service have our refreshed interior configuration which provides our guests with one consistent experience across the fleet we also began installing nextgeneration gogo inflight satellitebased wifi on our entire boeing and airbus fleets in 2018 which is now planned to be completed in early 2022 

our employees are a critical element of our reputation we have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard we heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest satisfaction 

• routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we do not serve 

and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles our mileage plan™ offers some of the most comprehensive benefits in the industry allowing our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 17 partner carriers 

in 2020 we announced an expanded alliance with american aimed at providing our west coast guests with greater utility and international options while providing americans international guests with increased connectivity options covered by the alaska network coupled with the expanded alliance we also accepted an invitation to join one world with entrance expected on march 31 2021 these new alliances allow our guests increased global network utility and benefits along with increased opportunity to capture corporate sales when demand returns 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools we expect that the advancement and increased utilization of these tools will eliminate the need for some businessrelated travel 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

• direct to customer selling direct at alaskaaircom is less expensive than other channels we believe direct sales through this channel are preferable from a branding and customer relationship standpoint because we can establish ongoing communication with the guest and tailor offers accordingly as a result we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website 

  

• traditional and online travel agencies both traditional and online travel agencies typically use global distribution systems gds to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel or rely on it to a lesser extent than we do and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs 

  

• reservation call centers our call centers are located in phoenix az seattle wa and boise id we generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers 

our sales by channel are as follows 



a includes results for virgin america for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in typical years our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel this pattern was not followed in 2020 because of the covid19 pandemic and 2021 may also experience abnormal trends as a result of the ongoing recovery in a typical year some of the impacts of seasonality are offset by travel from the west coast to leisure destinations like hawaii and costa rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern us 

seasonality and operational fluctuations are not predictable in the current environment and may permanently impact our typical experience of passenger loads postpandemic in a typical year in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

• pricing initiatives by us or our competitors 

• changes in fuel costs 

• increases in competition at our primary airports 

• general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand 

  

• increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs and 

• air space and air traffic control delays particularly in seattle and san francisco 

  

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees and human capital 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2020 we employed 21997 16643 at alaska 3511 at horizon and 1843 at mcgee air services active employees of those employees 88 are fulltime and 12 are parttime wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 47 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2020 and 43 in 2019 approximately 3300 of our employees were on paid or unpaid leaves as of december 31 2020 and are included in the totals above 

most major airlines including alaska and horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand 

labor organizations 

at december 31 2020 labor unions represented 86 of alaska’s 51 of horizon’s and 87 of mcgee air services employees 

our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under the rla collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2020 were as follows 



a negotiations with alpa for an updated collective bargaining agreement are ongoing as of the date of this filing 

b as a result of amendments to mexican labor laws the company has up to four years to make changes to the existing labor agreements during that time the existing contracts remain in place 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2020 were as follows 



mcgee air services union contract at december 31 2020 was as follows 



given the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic which is expected to have lasting impacts on our business into 2021 we have taken action to adjust the size of our workforce to limit the number of involuntary furloughs we initiated earlyout and voluntary leave programs as well as offered incentive leaves for alaska pilots and aircraft mechanics approximately 3900 employees opted in to these programs including over 600 employees that volunteered for earlyout separation from alaska and horizon in addition we reduced our nonunion management positions by approximately 300 positions as a result of these actions we were able to reduce the number of involuntary furloughs to approximately 400 the majority of which have returned to work by december 31 2020 

diversity and inclusion 

at alaska we believe that every person deserves respect regardless of race ethnicity capability age gender or sexual orientation we are committed to advancing equity in all forms and have set specific measurable goals to deliver on our commitments to racial equity in 2020 we joined several other corporate leaders in creating the washington employers for racial equity which will work to achieve parity in hiring pay and promotion for black employees support blackowned businesses and invest a combined 2 billion over the next five years to support racial equity we also recently published our 2025 diversity equity and inclusion goals which will hold us accountable to our commitments to increase racial diversity increase our employee engagement scores around inclusion related topics and create career pathways for at least 175000 young people by supporting programs that empower and enable opportunity through a lens of racial equity

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the the transportation security administration tsa and the faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

• dot a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates while airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the dot has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities essential air service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes international treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the us and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights the dot has been active in implementing a variety of “consumer protection” regulations covering subjects such as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the dot for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

• faa the faa through federal aviation regulations fars generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to 

major overhauls periodically the faa issues airworthiness directives ads that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations all airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the faa from time to time for alleged violations of fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

• tsa airlines serving the us must operate a tsaapproved aircraft operator standard security program aossp and comply with tsa security directives sds and regulations under tsa authority we are required to collect a september 11 security fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the tsa for alleged violations of the aossp sds or security regulations we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the rla to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety and health programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

environmental 

  

we are also subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters both domestically and internationally domestic regulations that have an impact to our operations include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act resource conservation and recovery act clean water act safe drinking water act the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act the national environmental policy act including environmental justice emergency planning and community righttoknow act and the toxic substances control act many state and local environmental regulations exceed these federal regulations in the future we expect there to be incremental legislation aimed at further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions hazardous substances and additional focus on environmental justice 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions generated by the airline industry and the impact of those emissions on climate change have faced increased scrutiny further we know that attention to climate issues and impact have grown amongst our employees and guests we recognize that our operations have an impact on the environment and are responsible for addressing those impacts through our own operations as well as in partnership with governments industry manufacturers employees and guests to enable new technology for the longterm 

the airline industry committed to carbon neutral growth starting in 2020 through this commitment we have joined participation in the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia a global marketbased emissions offset program issued by the international civil aviation organization to be carbon neutral for international growth as a result of the covid19 pandemic the growth baseline year was modified and set to 2019 during the initial phase this does not have a direct impact on domestic flights however the epa finalized a rule in 2020 on aircraft emission standards which aligns with the international agreements additional commitments to decarbonize through the paris climate accord and domestic carbon neutrality remain a potential impact to our industry 

our commitment to sustainability is anchored by our efforts to reduce our carbon emissions from jet fuel to mitigate emissions and keep with industry commitments towards reductions we have taken a number of key actions including transitioning to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets such as the boeing 737 max utilizing fuelefficient winglets and flying efficient flight paths alaska has joined with others at seattle tacoma international airport and san francisco international airport to strengthen the pathway to commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel through an offtake agreement with neste in san francisco alaska has started to use sustainable aviation fuel on an ongoing basis to reduce the lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions of our flights and will help comply with corsia obligations in 2020 we also strengthened our commitment to emissions reduction through a partnership with microsoft alaska airlines and microsoft are partnering to use sustainable 

aviation fuel to reduce the climate change impact of microsoft employee travel on the top routes their employees fly in addition alaska and horizon continue to utilize electric ground equipment at airports when we have the infrastructure to support it 

overall the total alaska mainline greenhouse gas emissions intensity trend has improved significantly since 2009 with our goals to reduce emissions intensity more broadly we know that being responsible for our impact is a critical part of delivering value for all those who depend on us – employees communities guests and owners – over the long term to that end we are focused on addressing the breadth of our most significant environmental impacts across emissions and waste as well as important social impacts alaska leads the industry in inflight recycling and has reduced waste to landfill by over 60 per passenger over the past decade in 2018 we were the first us airline to remove plastic straws and stir sticks from our aircraft and in 2019 we launched a campaign called fillbeforeyoufly to engage our employees and guests in reducing plastic waste for more details on alaska’s emission reductions programs as well as status on other key environmental initiatives see alaska’s annual sustainability reports and environmental performance metrics on our website 

wwwflysustainablycomreports the information contained on our sustainability website is not a part of this annual report on form 10k 

although we do not currently anticipate that specific environmental regulation will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations related to our existing or past operations or compliance issues could have the impact to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

covid19 

the global pandemic caused by covid19 and related measures implemented to combat its spread has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations financial position and liquidity 

in late 2019 an outbreak of novel coronavirus and its resulting disease covid19 was detected in wuhan china since that time covid19 has spread rapidly throughout the globe including within the united states where millions of cases have been positively diagnosed to date in march 2020 the president of the united states declared a national emergency in response to the rapid spread and all markets we serve implemented some measure of travel restriction or stayathome order these orders combined with a wariness among the public of travel by aircraft due to perceived risk of infection resulted in an unprecedented decline in business and leisure travel cancellations of conventions and conferences sporting events concerts and other similar events as well as the closure of popular tourist destinations contributed to this decline this reduction in demand had a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations as there is uncertainty of when these restrictions will be lifted or when demand may return we expect to continue to see negative impacts from the covid19 pandemic on our business our operations could be negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to covid19 or if they are subject to additional governmental covid19 stayathome health orders or similar 

restrictions measures restricting the ability of our airport or inflight employees to come to work may cause further deterioration in our service or operations all of which could negatively affect our business additionally the availability of covid19 vaccines and the timing of inoculation in each state we serve will impact the willingness of the public to travel and our ability to recover from the impacts of the pandemic 

in response to the pandemic we implemented and continue to refine and adjust a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impacts on our business this strategy may itself have negative impacts on our business and operations one such action is the elimination of change fees for first and main cabin fares and the ability to rebook travel for an extended period beyond standard rebooking terms the loss of change fee revenue combined with ongoing significant ticket cancellation activity has adversely impacted our revenues and liquidity 

we have also implemented significant cash preservation and cost reduction strategies in response to the impacts of covid19 these strategies include but are not limited to capital expenditure reductions solicitation of voluntary short and longterm leaves of absence and renegotiation of contractual terms and conditions with vendors these measures while helpful in slowing the rate at which we utilize our cash are not expected to fully offset the loss of cash as a result of decreased ticket sales further should we not be able to recall and provide training to those accepting longterm leaves of absence to provide staffing to match our expectations of capacity we may not be able to capitalize on the return of demand this may have a negative impact on our financial results 

at this time we are unable to predict what impact the pandemic will have on future customer behavior future business travel may be impacted by widespread use of video conferencing or the reduction of business travel budgets travelers may also be more reluctant in general to travel and the company may need to expend significant resources to educate and demonstrate that air travel does not pose a health risk in addition the company has incurred and will continue to incur covid19 related costs for enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among employees and guests although these procedures are elective the industry may be subject to mandated cleaning and safety measures in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement additionally the availability of covid19 vaccines and the timing of inoculation in each state we serve will impact the willingness of the public to travel these contingencies individually and in the aggregate could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we have accepted certain conditions by accepting funding under the payroll support program of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act 

the cares act was signed into law on march 27 2020 providing us airlines and related businesses the ability to access liquidity in the form of grants loans loan guarantees and other investments by the us government 

in 2020 the company alaska horizon and mcgee entered agreements with the united states department of the treasury treasury to secure approximately 11 billion of funding under the cares act payroll support program psp of which 290 million is in the form of an unsecured senior term loan payable over ten years on january 15 2021 alaska and horizon finalized agreements with the treasury and accepted partial disbursement of funds through an extended round of psp funding made available under the consolidated appropriations act 2021 psp proceeds must be used exclusively for employee payroll and benefits expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the psp agreements and the applicable provisions of the cares act 

also in 2020 the company and its airline subsidiaries entered agreements with the treasury to obtain access to term loans of approximately 19 billion under the cares act loan program funds drawn under the loan program must be secured with assets owned by alaska or horizon 

to date the company has drawn 135 million from the loan facility and may at its option borrow additional amounts in up to two subsequent borrowings until may 28 2021 all proceeds must be used for general corporate purposes and operating expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreements and the applicable provisions of the cares act all borrowings are prepayable in whole or in part and are ultimately due and payable on september 26 2025 or march 28 2025 with respect to the portion of the loan if any secured with certain loyalty program assets 

in addition to repayment commitments we are subject to the following conditions under our cares act psp and loan agreements 

• alaska horizon and mcgee have to refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits for nonofficer employees through march 31 2021 

• alaska and horizon may have to maintain dotprescribed levels of air service to markets they served as of march 1 2020 through march 1 2022 

• the company may not repurchase its common stock or pay dividends on its common stock until the later of march 31 2022 or one year after secured loan funds are repaid 

• the company must meet minimum liquidity and collateral coverage ratio requirements until the secured loan funds are repaid 

• compensation and severance payments for officers and employees who earned more than 425000 in total compensation in 2019 will be subject to maximum limitations through the later of october 1 2022 or one year after secured loan funds are repaid and 

• the company must maintain certain internal controls and records and provide any additional reporting required by the us government relating to psp and loan funding 

these conditions may adversely affect the company’s profitability our ability to negotiate favorable terms with loyalty partners our attractiveness to investors and our ability to compensate at marketcompetitive levels and retain key personnel 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our company by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives this would harm our business 

we announced plans to replace many of our airbus aircraft with boeing 737 max aircraft and in january 2021 we took delivery of our first max aircraft which is expected to enter revenue service in march 2021 although the grounding of the aircraft was lifted in late 2020 following an extensive recertification process there is potential the traveling public may not trust the aircraft for safe operation as a result we may be required to expend significant resources in restoring guest confidence on the safe operation of the 737 max aircraft failure to address guest confidence may negatively harm our business growth plans and results of operations 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

factors that might impact our operations include 

• contagious illness and fear of contagion 

• congestion construction andor space constraints at airports specifically in our hub locations of seattle los angeles and san francisco 

• air traffic control problems 

• adverse weather conditions 

• lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc 

  

• increased security measures or breaches in security 

  

• changes in international treaties concerning air rights 

• international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity and 

• other changes in business conditions 

due to the concentration of our flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that require substantial compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections as a result of the covid19 pandemic we expect further regulation of onboard health and hygiene matters 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels these initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates these laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs new initiatives with employerfunded costs specifically those impacting washington state could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared to our competitors in recent years the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws particularly in california application of these laws may result in operational disruption increased litigation risk and impact on negotiated labor agreements additionally compliance with existing and future regulation around environmental laws including those involving aircraft emissions and environmental investigation and remediation costs could require significant expenditures or result in significant fines or penalties 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business additionally changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance any instances of noncompliance could result in additional fines and fees 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

• significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel 

  

• significantly increase security and insurance costs 

  

• make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive 

  

• increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices 

  

• increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and 

  

• result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa 

  

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases 

  

we rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing among others 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key west coast markets this dynamic may be exacerbated by actions from airlines as we compete to attract passengers during the recovery from the covid19 pandemic the resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit costreduction goals this is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations 

  

our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the west coast this results in a high concentration of our business in key west coast markets a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle portland and bay area hubs in 2020 passengers to and from seattle portland and the bay area accounted for 84 of our total guests 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for 

air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing and airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on de havilland and embraer additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type as a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods additionally if covid19 causes our limited vendors to have performance problems reduced or ceased operations bankruptcies or other events causing them to be unable to fulfill their commitments to us our operations and business could be materially adversely affected 

should these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft we may not be able to grow our fleet at our intended rate which could impact our financial position following the recertification of the 737 max aircraft boeing has a significant production backlog which may impact the timing of deliveries we have 32 7379 max aircraft on order with 13 aircraft deliveries currently anticipated in 2021 if we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner our growth plans could be significantly impacted additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers this could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including the west coast international alliance wcia with american which was announced in 2020 these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our loyalty program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and will continue to have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

our impending entry into the one world global alliance is expected to provide us with many benefits including the ability to seamlessly connect our guests to more points around the globe as well as better serve corporate partners entry into the alliance may cause us to lose existing codeshare agreements with partners who are not one world members and could limit options to bring non one world carrier partners into our mileage plan tm program further maintaining the wcia with another us airline may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny failure to appropriately manage these partnerships and alliances could negatively impact future growth plans and our financial position 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as video conferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our guests checkin using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or our data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

failure to appropriately comply with information security rules and regulations or safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost 

we accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business many international and us jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing their own data security and privacy regulatory framework with which we our business partners and our corporate customers must comply there are also various bills pending at the us state and federal levels that could impose additional privacy and data security obligations this uncertain and increasingly complex regulatory environment may result in significant expenses associated with increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of personal information if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence decreased sales or be exposed to fraud any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and operations in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers to the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm 

cyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations onboard safety reputation and financial condition 

our sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify because of these everevolving risks and regular attacks we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices however the nature of these attacks means that proper policies and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation a cybersecurity attack impacting our onboard or other operational systems may result in an accident or incident onboard or significant operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation operation and financial position further a significant portion of our office employees have transitioned to remote work which could increase our potential exposure to cyberattacks and could compromise our financial or operational systems 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

we have a significant amount of debt and fixed obligations and have incurred substantial incremental debt in response to the covid19 pandemic these obligations could lead to liquidity restraints and have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

we carry and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt and aircraft operating lease commitments in response to the covid19 pandemic we have incurred and may continue to seek new financing sources to fund our operations while demand remains at an unprecedented low level and for the unknown duration of any economic recovery period although we aim to keep our leverage low due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions further as we incur incremental obligations issuers may require future debt agreements to contain more restrictive covenants or require additional collateral beyond historical market terms which may further restrict our ability to successfully access capital 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft 

as of december 31 2020 the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737700 800 900 900ers was approximately 99 years the average age of our operating a320 and a321neo aircraft was approximately 72 years the average age of our owned e175 aircraft was approximately 26 years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 127 years typically our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in unplanned maintenance expense as we are required to return leased planes in a contractually specified condition 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results 

in accordance with acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the virgin america acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually we could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties we can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods any such charges may materially affect our financial results 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

the companys brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media 

we operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media negative publicity including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees or failure to adhere to covid19 related health and safety protocols can spread rapidly through social media should the company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity the companys brand and reputation may be significantly harmed such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results 

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

labor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses in addition to costs associated with represented employee groups labor costs could also increase for nonunionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major us airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market although ample efforts have been dedicated to rightsizing our management structure following the merger with virgin america these increased labor costs may adversely affect our financial performance 

should employees engage in job actions such as slowdowns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during section 6 negotiations although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts the operation could be significantly impacted although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert management’s attention from other projects and issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the inability to attract retain and train qualified personnel or maintain our culture could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we compete against other major us airlines for pilots aircraft technicians and other skilled labor as more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age the us airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage attrition beyond normal levels the inability to attract new pilots or our key vendors inability to attract and retain mechanics or other skilled labor positions could negatively impact our operating results as a result our business prospects could be harmed additionally we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages or pay increased rates to our vendors to retain these positions this would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our financial position 

our success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a unified culture with cohesive values and goals much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty failure to maintain and grow the alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies as part of this process we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs 

regulation 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware or the dgcl or as to which the dgcl confers jurisdiction to the court of chancery of the state of delaware or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the exchange act or the securities act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction the exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations 

this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees in addition stockholders who do bring a claim in the court of chancery of the state of delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware the court of chancery of the state of delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments or results may be more favorable to our company than to our stockholders

the company is a party to routine litigation matters incidental to its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected liabilities for litigation related contingencies are recorded when a loss is determined to be probable and estimable 

in 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all virgin america flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of california and city of san francisco wage and hour laws the court certified a class of approximately 1800 flight attendants in november 2016 the company believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit 

in july 2018 the court granted in part plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding virgin america and alaska airlines as a successorininterest to virgin america responsible for various damages and penalties sought by the class members in february 2019 the court entered final judgment against virgin america and alaska airlines in the amount of approximately 78 million it did not award injunctive relief against alaska airlines in february 2021 an appellate court reversed portions of the lower court decision and significantly reduced the judgment the determination of total judgment has not been completed as of the date of this fili ng based on the facts and circumstances available the company believes the range of potential loss to be between 0 and 78 million the company has recorded an estimate of the loss within this range in the financial statements for the period ending december 31 2020 as a recognized subsequent event 

the company is seeking an appellate court ruling that the california laws on which the judgment is based are invalid as applied to national airlines pursuant to the us constitution and federal law and for other employment law and improper class certification reasons the company remains confident that a higher court will respect the federal preemption principles that were enacted to shield interstate common carriers from a patchwork of state and local wage and hour regulations such as those at issue in this case and agree with the companys other bases for appeal 

in january 2019 a pilot filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all alaska and horizon pilots for damages based on alleged violations of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra plaintiff received class certification in august 2020 the case is in discovery the company believes the claims in the case are without factual and legal merit and intends to defend the lawsuit 

the company is involved in other litigation around the application of state and local employment laws like many air carriers our defenses are similar to those identified above including that the state and local laws are preempted by federal law and are unconstitutional because they impede interstate commerce none of these additional disputes are material 

this forwardlooking statement is based on managements current understanding of the relevant laws and facts and it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries

year in review 

covid19 impact and response 

the public health and economic crises resulting from the outbreak of covid19 has had and continues to have an unprecedented impact on our business the adverse impacts from the crises have been material to our business operating results and financial condition the cancellation of large public events suspension of business travel closure of popular tourist destinations and implementation of stayathome orders throughout the country that began in march 2020 drove demand for air travel to historic lows passenger enplanements were lowest in april 2020 and experienced a slow and volatile recovery pattern through the end of the year 

in response to the crises at hand we took immediate action to reinforce the health and safety standards for our guests through our nextlevel care initiative we emphasized nearly 100 measures aimed at creating layers of safety aimed and a safe and healthy environment at all stages of travel 

we also moved quickly to reduce flying and associated costs compared to the same quarters in the prior year our flown capacity was down 75 in q2 down 55 in q3 and down 42 in q4 resulting in full year capacity that was 44 below 2019 levels by reducing flying we were able to reduce variable costs which we supplemented with efforts to minimize discretionary and nonessential spend our efforts included officer pay reductions including 100 pay reductions for both the ceo and alaska president suspending or cancellation of pay increases for all employees reducing management hours and offering voluntary leave programs we also solicited earlyouts and provided incentive leaves for certain workgroups which reduced our need to furlough employees in october we did furlough approximately 400 flight attendants the majority of whom have returned to work and reduced management positions by approximately 300 as a result our nonfuel operating expenses excluding the payroll support program grant wage offset and special items declined 22 for the year 

to further curb cash outflows we suspended our cash dividend and share repurchase program and cut capital expenditures to 206 million for the year 

in addition to these efforts we also sought to fortify our liquidity position we accessed over 5 billion in new capital including approximately 12 billion raised in the capital markets through the issuance of eetcs approximately 600 million in bank financing approximately  280 m illion from the sale of 10 airbus aircraft approximately 11 billion received under the cares act payroll support program and approximately 19 billion made available under the cares act loan program 

remarkably we ended the year with adjusted net debt of 17 billion essentially flat to 2019 levels despite a decline in total operating revenues of 52 billion in 2020 we were able to keep this metric flat to prior year as a result of our immediate actions taken to reduce cash spend through the reduction of operating expenses and discretionary spend these actions coupled with 753 million in payroll support program grants enabled us to preserve our balance sheet strength which was a significant achievement in such a challenging year this strength positions us well to seize opportunities in the recovery expected ahead 

see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

recovery and 2021 outlook 

  

the timing and rate of recovery remains difficult to predict the slow and at times volatile return of demand that we experienced in 2020 is likely to continue into 2021 we are cautiously optimistic that there will be a step change in demand once the vaccine has been broadly distributed and state and local authorities begin to relax restrictions leisure travel has led in the recovery thus far and we believe it will continue to do so business travel has remained more severely depressed and we believe it will be slower to recover in 2021 this is in part due to the expectation that businesses will be addressing duty of care concerns plans for reopening corporate offices and potential resizing corporate travel budgets our focus is on preparing our company and operation to rebuild capacity to levels that meet demand as it returns 

we believe lowcosts are critical to our success and returning to prepandemic casmex levels is a priority even if we remain a smaller business for some time in the first quarter of 2021 we expect to incur unit costs that are approximately 20 over 2019 levels and expect sequential improvement in the quarters beyond with a goal of reaching 2019 unit costs as we move into 2022 although there is still significant work to be done to achieve these goals we believe that our employees are up to the challenge 

our outlook and the guidance provided will be directly impacted by health trends the vaccine rollout and regulations and restrictions imposed by state local and federal authorities our plans for 2021 will be responsive to emerging information from all of these areas and the guidance we have provided above is subject to greater uncertainty than we have historically experienced the work we have done in 2020 to keep our balance sheet strong provides a strong foundation for taking advantage of the recovery ahead whatever course it may take our people are focused on keeping our costs low running a great operation and welcoming guests back to travel with nextlevel care to ensure they are safe and comfortable when they fly these competitive advantages we have cultivated over many years will continue to serve us well in 2021 and beyond and we are confident that we are prepared to meet the challenges ahead and that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger and more resilient airline 

results of operations 

adjusted nongaap results and pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because 

• by excluding fuel expense and certain special items including the payroll support program wage offset impairment and restructuring charges and mergerrelated costs from our unit metrics we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations as we focus on costreduction initiatives emerging from the covid19 pandemic our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs so even a small reduction in nonfuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results in addition we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run so it is important for management and thus investors to understand the 

impact of and trends in companyspecific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity airport costs maintenance costs etc which are more controllable by management 

• cost per asm casm excluding fuel and certain special items such as the payroll support program wage offset impairment and restructuring charges and mergerrelated costs is one of the most important measures used by management and by the air group board of directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance 

• adjusted income before income tax and casm excluding fuel and other items as specified in our plan documents are important metrics for the employee incentive plan which covers the majority of air group employees 

• casm excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry the measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors 

• disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items we believe that disclosing the impact of certain items such as mergerrelated costs and marktomarket hedging adjustments is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines 

• although we disclose our passenger unit revenues we do not nor are we able to evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the midtolong term although we believe it is useful to evaluate nonfuel unit costs for the reasons noted above we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

2020 compared with 2019 

our consolidated net loss for 2020 was 13 billion or 1072 per diluted share compared to net income of 769 million or 619 per diluted share in 2019 

excluding the impact of the payroll support program grant wage offset special items and marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments our adjusted consolidated net loss for 2020 was 13 billion or 1017 per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 798 million or 642 per share in 2019 the following table reconciles our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share eps during the full year 2020 and 2019 to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

operating revenues 

total operating revenues decreased 52 billion or 59 during 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue 

on a consolidated basis passenger revenue for 2020 decreased by 51 billion or 63 on a 44 decrease in capacity and a 29 point decrease in load factor decreased revenue yearoveryear is primarily due to the significant loss of demand due to the covid19 pandemic beginning in march 2020 load factors were severely depressed and in response we reduced our capacity which remained well below 2019 levels through the end of 2020 although we saw modest recovery during summer months and over the holiday periods primarily led by leisure travelers resurgence of cases throughout the united states coupled with restrictions imposed by state and local governments stalled further improvements 

mileage plan other revenue 

on a consolidated basis mileage plan other revenue decreased 91 million or 20 as compared to 2019 largely due to a reduction in purchased miles and decreased commissions received from our affinity card partner and an overall reduction in consumer spending 

cargo and other revenue 

on a consolidated basis cargo and other revenue decreased 48 million or 22 from 2019  the decrease is primarily driven by reduced belly cargo activity as a result of schedule reductions for passenger aircraft as well as capacity limitations on our freighters that resulted from an issue with the barrier walls in the aircraft that was identified in 2020 the barrier walls will eventually be replaced but the freighters can be operated at reduced capacity until the replacement occurs these reductions were offset by new cargo routes announced in alaska as well as an increase in online shopping activity leading to increased overall cargo volumes 

we expect that our cargo revenues will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as all three freighters return to full capacity and as cargo capacity on passenger aircraft increases 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses decreased 24 billion or 31 compared to 2019 we consider it useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2019 are more fully described below 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense as defined below and the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases aircraft fuel expense can be volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease 

raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense decreased 12 billion or 62 compared to 2019 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



raw fuel expense per gallon decreased 29 due to lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as the refining costs associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2020 was driven by a 26 decrease in crude oil prices and a 57 decrease in refining margins as compared to the prior year fuel gallons consumed decreased by 401 million or 47 consistent with the decrease in capacity of 44 and a 42 decrease in block hours 

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices have on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 18 million in 2020 compared to losses of 16 million in 2019 these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement 

as of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to decrease approximately 10 in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 for similar reasons as noted above as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits decreased during 2020 by 317 million or 13 compared to 2019 excluding the impact of the payroll support program grant wage offset the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages and payroll taxes decreased by a combined 292 million on a 21 decrease in ftes decreased wages are primarily due to voluntary leaves of absence taken by thousands of our employees throughout 2020 voluntary earlyouts accepted by 600 employees and a reduction in executive pay and hours for management employees 

medical and other benefits expense decreased 23 million or 7 partially due to an overall reduction in ftes coupled with reduced usage of medical benefits as compared to the prior year decreases were offset by increased medical rates in 2020 

we expect wages and benefits expense to be higher in 2021 compared to 2020 given our expected growth in overall ftes needed to support our expected capacity growth our guidance does not include the impacts of any future agreements we may reach in 2021 most notably with our mainline pilots whose contract became amendable in april 2020 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense decreased to 130 million in 2020 from 163 million in 2019 on a decreased overall wage base coupled with reduced achievement of stated goals as compared to the prior year the decrease was offset by achievement on a supplemental incentive pay plan approved in 2020 and increased achievement from our quarterly operational bonus program as compared to 2019 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs decreased by 116 million compared to 2019 primarily due to a significant reduction in engine events and heavy checks as well as reduced powerbythehour expense on reduced utilization of covered aircraft lower maintenance costs and activity is offset by penalties recorded for failure to meet certain contractual minimum obligations 

we expect aircraft maintenance expense to increase in 2021 as we return temporarily grounded aircraft to flying which will result in increased heavy maintenance events and additional powerbythehour expense on covered aircraft 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense decreased 32 million or 10 compared to 2019 primarily the result of full impairment taken on certain leased airbus aircraft the decrease was partially offset by the full year of expense for two leased a321neos added to the operating fleet in 2019 

we expect aircraft rent to be lower in 2021 given the permanent parking and impairment of 40 leased airbus aircraft in 2020 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses decreased 114 million or 21 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a 44 decrease in capacity on 38 fewer departures 

we expect landing fees and other rental expense to increase in 2021 as we bring capacity back to our network we also expect rate increases at many airports we serve specifically our hubs as significant capital programs are underway and will be included in our lease rates 

selling expenses 

selling expenses decreased by 212 million or 68 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a significant reduction in distribution costs and credit card commissions due to lower sales reduced marketing spend and sponsorship costs due to the renegotiation of certain agreements with partners also contributed to the yearoveryear decline 

we expect selling expense to increase in 2021 due primarily to higher sales as demand for air travel returns 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased slightly as compared to 2019 due to the impairment in the first quarter of 2020 of our owned q400 fleet as well as the writeoff of certain leasehold improvements 

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2021 primarily due to depreciation taken on the 737 max aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements decreased 38 million or 23 in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease is primarily due to a 23 decrease in capacity flown by skywest as compared to the prior year and reduced contractual rates incurred for a portion of 2020 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to be higher in 2021 as regional capacity has largely rebounded to where it was prior to the pandemic 

special items  impairment charges and other 

we recorded impairment and other charges of 627 million in 2020 the charges were largely driven by our decision to permanently remove certain leased airbus aircraft from operating service for these aircraft any remaining operating lease assets and related leasehold improvements spare inventory and parts were expensed additionally for these aircraft we recorded an accrual for total estimated lease return costs charges also include the writedown of the ten owned airbus a320 aircraft and our q400 fleet to their respective fair value an accrued loss on a class action lawsuit judgment received subsequent to december 31 2020 and the full writeoff of gate assets at dallaslove field plus certain other immaterial items 

special items  restructuring charges 

we recorded restructuring charges of 220 million in 2020 relating to the reduction of our workforce through voluntary early retirement and temporary leaves incentive leave programs involuntary furloughs and reductions in force charges are primarily comprised of wages for those pilots and mechanics on incentive leave programs ongoing medical benefit coverage and lumpsum termination payments the total charge for the program was revised in the fourth quarter to capture pilot recalls anticipated in 2021 as a result of increased capacity expectations in our network and a change in the mix of aircraft type additional changes to this charge could be necessary in the future if the pilot recall schedule changes again 

special items  mergerrelated costs 

we recorded 6 million of mergerrelated costs in 2020 associated with our ongoing integration of former virgin america operations compared to 44 million in 2019 costs incurred in 2020 are primarily comprised of certain technology integration costs we do not expect to incur integration related charges in 2021 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2020 we recorded net nonoperating expense excluding special items of 39 million compared to 47 million in 2019 the decrease is primarily due to an increase in income generated by additional cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced expense from our definedbenefit pension plan improved nonoperating expense was offset by increased interest expense on an increased outstanding debt balance 

we recorded special items in nonoperating expense of 26 million in 2020 for prepayment penalties and swapbreak charges related to the early repayment of debt that was previously collateralized by the a320 aircraft which we sold in 2020 

additional segment information 

refer to note 14 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

mainline pretax loss was 14 billion in 2020 compared to pretax income of 993 million in 2019 the 24 billion shift to pretax loss was driven by a 46 billion decrease in mainline operating revenue offset by a 11 billion decrease in mainline nonfuel operating expense and a 1 billion decrease in mainline fuel expense 

as compared to the prior year lower mainline revenues are primarily attributable to a 65 decrease in traffic on a 47 reduction in capacity driven by the significant reduction in demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic nonfuel operating expenses declined significantly on cost savings driven by reduced variable costs on lower capacity as well as decreased wages and benefits expense from voluntary leaves of absence and a reduction in hours for management employees lower raw fuel prices coupled with decreased consumption from the reduction in flying drove the decrease in mainline fuel expense 

regional 

our regional operations generated a pretax loss of 421 million in 2020 compared to a pretax profit of 2 million in 2019 the shift to pretax loss was primarily attributable to a 660 million decrease in operating revenues partially offset by a 104 million decrease in nonfuel operating expense and a 133 million decrease in fuel costs decreased regional revenues is primarily the result of a 50 decrease in revenue passengers on an 18 decrease in capacity flown stemming from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

horizon 

horizon achieved a pretax profit of 41 million in 2020 compared to 38 million in 2019 primarily as a result of significant cost reduction efforts implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic as horizon records revenue based on total capacity sold to alaska under the terms of the cpa revenue was impacted to a lesser degree by the overall reduction in demand spurred by the pandemic 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have taken and will continue to take action to reduce costs increase liquidity and preserve the relative strength of our balance sheet from the onset of the pandemic we have taken the following key actions to enhance and preserve our liquidity 

• obtained approximately 16 billion in payroll support program funding to use towards payments of wages and benefits including the extension finalized in january 2021 

  

• executed an agreement with the us department of the treasury to obtain up to 19 billion through the cares act loan program the collateral pool for the agreement includes certain mileage plan tm assets and cash flow streams 34 aircraft and 15 spare engines 

• obtained 12 billion in financing through the issuance of eetc instruments collateralized by 42 boeing 737 aircraft and 19 embraer e175 aircraft 

• reached an agreement in principle to restructure our aircraft purchase agreement with boeing allowing for greater flexibility and lower cash outflows in 2021 

• drew 400 million from existing credit facilities and 

• suspended our share repurchase program and quarterly dividend indefinitely 

although we have no plans to access equity markets we believe our equity would be of high interest to investors the liquidity raised from these financings coupled with the availability of additional liquidity and our meaningful cost reductions have provided the company with confidence in our ability to withstand the depressed demand and prepare for recovery because of our successful efforts to reduce spending and preserve cash our adjusted net debt is nearly flat as compared to december 31 2019 

as the business recovers and eventually returns to profitability reducing outstanding debt and strengthening our balance sheet will be a high priority based on our expectations about the recovery ahead we expect to incur cash flow from operations of 100 million to zero in the first quarter including funds received as part of the cares act payroll support program for the first half of the year we expect cash flows from operations to be positive 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations and to remain in compliance with the financial debt covenants in existing financing arrangements for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



debttocapitalization adjusted for operating leases 



a to best reflect our leverage at december 31 2020 we included the shortterm borrowings stemming from the covid19 pandemic which are classified as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 

adjusted net debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization special items and rent 



the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash used in operating activities 

  

net cash used in operating activities was 234 million in 2020 compared to net cash provided of 17 billion in 2019 cash provided by ticket sales is the primary source of our operating cash flow our primary use of operating cash flow is operating expenses changes in demand that resulted from the pandemic and the changes we made to our operations in response had a dramatic impact on our operating cash flows in 2020  

in 2020 revenues declined 52 billion versus prior year through reduced flying levels and removal of fixed costs we reduced operating expenses by 24 billion versus prior year which reflects the benefit of the 753 million cash grant we received under the payroll support program 2020 operating expenses included 627 million in special items that were largely noncash during the period this included impairment of property plant and equipment for which the cash outflow occurred in the past and accruals that are associated with future cash out flows such as the expected costs of lease returns and the impairment of leased aircraft 

in 2020 air traffic liability atl increased 173 million which included approximately 13 billion in new ticket purchases offset by approximately 500 million in tickets that existed in atl at the end of 2019 which flew and were recognized in revenue in 2020 and approximately 600 million in cash refunds issued to guests although air traffic liability was a source of working capital in 2020 as of december 31 2020 it includes 569 million in ewallet credits that were issued to guests as a result of trip cancellations these credits are expected to be redeemed by guests for travel in future periods and will represent a working capital headwind 

also in 2020 we recognized a 516 million tax benefit associated with the net operating losses that were incurred during the period which will be carried back to prior tax years or used in future tax years these benefits are expected to result in operating cash inflows in future periods but none were received in 2020 

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 593 million during 2020 compared to 791 million in 2019 our capital expenditures were 206 million or 490 million lower than in 2019 primarily driven by the elimination or postponement of capital expenditures and temporary cessation of predelivery deposits as a result of the covid19 pandemic our net purchases of marketable securities were 644 million in 2020 compared to net purchases of 136 million in 2019 increased net purchases are primarily driven by additional cash on hand from borrowings and the psp which allowed the company to invest additional funds 

cash provided by financing activities 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 20 billion during 2020 compared to cash used in financing activities of 813 million in 2019 during the year we received funds from new secured debt financing of 26 billion including 12 billion from the issuance of the eetcs 290 million from the loan portion of the proceeds from the psp and 135 million drawn on the cares act secured term loan these proceeds were partially offset by debt payments of 565 million dividend payments of 45 million and 31 million in common stock repurchases 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

as of december 31 2020 alaska had commitments to purchase 32 boeing 7379 max aircraft with deliveries in 2021 through 2023 and cancelable purchase commitments for 30 airbus a320neo aircraft with deliveries from 2024 through 2026 at this time we do not expect to take delivery of these 30 airbus aircraft horizon also has commitments to purchase three e175 aircraft with deliveries in 2023 alaska has options to acquire up to 37 additional 737 max aircraft and horizon has options to acquire 30 e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2022 to 2024 in addition to the 32 e175 aircraft currently operated by skywest in our regional fleet we have options in future periods to add regional capacity by having skywest operate up to eight more e175 aircraft 

in december 2020 alaska announced an agreement in principle with boeing to restructure the existing aircraft purchase agreement upon execution of the agreement alaska will have commitments to purchase an additional 23 7379 max aircraft with deliveries between 2023 and 2024 the agreement in principle also provides for an incremental 15 options to purchase aircraft these options as well as the 37 available under the existing contractual agreement are expected to be available for delivery between 2023 and 2026 

to best reflect our expectations of future fleet activity we have included the firm deliveries from the boeing agreement in principle in the table below which summarizes our expected fleet count by year as of february 26 2021 



a anticipated fleet activity reflects intended early retirement and extensions or replacement of certain leases not all of which have been contracted yet 

b at december 31 2019 alaska had 10 operating a319 aircraft all of which were removed from operating service in 2020 

c aircraft are either owned or leased by horizon or operated under capacity purchase agreement with a third party 

firm orders and option exercises beyond 2021 are expected to be financed primarily through longterm debt and operating cash flows 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 



contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our obligations as of december 31 2020 for agreements with variable terms amounts included reflect our minimum obligations 



a future minimum lease payments for aircraft includes commitments for aircraft which have been removed from operating service as we have remaining obligations under existing terms 

b includes noncancelable contractual commitments for aircraft and engines buyer furnished equipment and contractual aircraft maintenance obligations 

c for variablerate debt future obligations are shown above using interest rates forecast as of december 31 2020 

d primarily comprised of nonaircraft lease costs associated with capacity purchase agreements 

the table above includes changes to our existing purchase agreement with boeing as outlined in the agreement in principle reached with boeing in 2020 as of december 31 2020 alaska has approximately 550 million in predelivery deposits on hand with boeing the revised delivery timeline for our existing firm orders in connection with the predelivery payment schedule we have agreed upon with boeing will reduce our 2021 capital commitments significantly from those outlined above additionally in the event that the demand environment does not support the need for deliveries as scheduled we can utilize slide rights under the agreement to defer as much as 300 million of these capital commitments from 2022 into later years 

los angeles international airport lax construction 

in may 2019 we executed an amended lease agreement with los angeles world airports which includes an agreement to renovate and upgrade the fuel system jet bridges and concourse facilities at terminal 6 of lax project terms and preconstruction readiness was approved and finalized in 2020 we expect construction will be completed by early 2024 under the terms of the agreement we expect to have total reimbursable cash outlays for the project of approximately 230 million to date we have made total cash outlays of 24 million and have received reimbursement for 87 million of that total 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 446 million at december 31 2020 compared to a 363 million unfunded position at december 31 2019 this results in an 85 funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 86 funded as of december 31 2019 there were no contributions to the plans in 2020 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the shortterm are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices usage of net operating losses whether bonus depreciation provisions are available any future tax reform efforts at the federal level as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2020 we received a net refund of tax payments of 2 million and had an effective tax rate of 280 we believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

frequent flyer programs 

  

alaskas mileage plan™ loyalty program awards mileage credits to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners referred to as flown miles we also sell services including miles for transportation companion fare™ certificates bag fee waivers and access to our brand and customer lists to major banks that offer alaska cobrand credit cards to a lesser extent miles for transportation are also sold to other nonairline partners such as hotels and car rental agencies the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or eligible airline partners and for nonairline products such as hotels as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide future travel 

mileage credits and the various other services we sell under our loyalty program represent performance obligations that are part of a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement accounting guidance requires that we use a relative standalone selling price model to allocate consideration received to the material performance obligations in these contracts our relative standalone selling price models are refreshed when contracts originate or are materially modified we also update our model annually based on observed volumes 

  

at december 31 2020 we had approximately 295 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate deferred revenue balance of 23 billion the deferred revenue resulting from our relative selling price allocations requires significant management judgment there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or expenses the most significant assumptions are described below 

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold 

  

we estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation including mileage credits by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimate the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables 

2 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel breakage 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem mileage credits for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program™ and historical and future award redemption patterns 

we review significant mileage plan™ assumptions on an annual basis or more frequently should circumstances indicate a need and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

impact of covid19 on critical accounting estimates 

there is uncertainty about when the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and economic consequences may be resolved and when demand may return to prepandemic levels as a result we have experienced a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making judgments and estimates relevant to critical accounting matters further as the pandemic and related economic impact continues to develop information may arise that could result in changes to or refinements of these estimates which may have a meaningful impact on our financial position and results of operations in future periods specific discussion around areas of impact are described below 

property and equipment and capitalized operating leases 

given the impact of the crisis the projected cash flows used to make future fleet decisions and assess our assets for impairment are subject to greater uncertainty than normal assumptions that drive such projected cash flows include expectations of future demand including total passenger revenues and volumerelated costs as well as future capacity requirements if expectations for these assumptions were to deteriorate estimated future cash flow projections could be negatively impacted and could result in further impairment of assets 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we have assessed our property and equipment and capitalized operating leases for impairment and have recorded 358 million in impairment charges primarily related to certain leased aircraft being permanently removed from our operating fleet as well as the writedown to fair value for certain owned aircraft refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion 

leased aircraft return costs 

as a result of the removal of leased aircraft discussed above the company is required to record an estimate for future return costs for these leased aircraft given many of the permanently parked aircraft have more than a year before the contractual date of return there is greater uncertainty around the estimated scope and cost of maintenance work that may be necessary for each aircraft to meet contractual return specifications unexpected events new airworthiness directives or maintenance bulletins or negotiations with lessors could result in material adjustments to our total accrued lease return costs 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded 209 million in lease return costs for aircraft that were permanently removed from the fleet in advance of their contracted lease return date refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend

  

we have interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases and interest rate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuel hedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil component of jet fuel limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against fuel price increases we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2020 would change the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 7 million or 28 million 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 15 million at december 31 2020 compared to a portfolio value of 11 million at december 31 2019 we did not have any collateral held by counterparties on these agreements as of december 31 2020 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variable rate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have a number of interest rate swaps that fix the interest rates on certain variable rate debt agreements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on average variable rate debt held during 2020 would have correspondingly changed our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 4 million our variable rate debt represents approximately 53 and 69 of our total longterm debt as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 approximately 614 million of the companys total variable rate notes payable were effectively fixed via interest rate swaps at december 31 2020 

our exposure to interest rate variability is further mitigated through our variable rate investment portfolio we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average one point more than they did in 2020 interest income would increase by approximately 16 million 

our variable rate instruments including longterm debt interest rate swaps and credit facilities all make reference to the london interbank offered rate libor as the interest rate benchmark it is expected that after 2021 libor will be discontinued as a reference rate in the event of the discontinuance of libor we will need to transition our liborbased contracts to a mutually agreedupon alternate benchmark rate which effectively places the lenders and the company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of libor at this time we do not anticipate that the discontinuance of libor will materially impact our liquidity or financial position

 item 1 our business tableend

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines alaska and horizon alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of alaska horizon is a washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981 and was acquired by air group in 1986 virgin america was a member of air group since it was acquired in 2016 until 2018 when alaska and virgin america combined operating certificates to become a single airline and legally merged into a single entity the company also includes mcgee air services an aviation services provider that was established as a whollyowned subsidiary of alaska in 2016 

alaska and horizon operate as separate airlines with individual business plans competitive factors and economic risks together with our regional airline partners we fly to 115 destinations with over 1300 daily departures through an expansive network across the us mexico canada and costa rica with global airline partners we provide our guests with a network of more than 800 destinations worldwide during 2019 we carried an alltime high 47 million guests and earned consolidated net income under generally accepted accounting principles gaap of 769 million compared to net income of 437 million in 2018 our adjusted net income was 798 million which excludes mergerrelated costs and marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments refer to results of operations in managements discussion and analysis for our reconciliation of nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

we organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments which are as follows 

• mainline  includes scheduled air transportation on alaskas boeing and airbus jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the us and in parts of mexico and costa rica 

• regional  includes horizons and other thirdparty carriers’ scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the us under capacity purchase agreements cpa this segment includes the actual revenues and expenses associated with regional flying as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by air group on behalf of the regional operations 

• horizon  includes the capacity sold to alaska under a cpa expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs ownership costs and maintenance costs 

our purpose is creating an airline people love the ing is to recognize that we are never done we are continually working to improve we believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively it is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance but also our people the communities we serve and the environment 

we marked the 16th consecutive year of profitability on an adjusted basis in 2019 our liquidity and capital position remain strong positioning us among other highquality industrial companies due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three us airlines with investment grade credit ratings the cash generated by our continued success enables us to invest in our business to deliver profitable growth enhance our guests experience and improve our financial position 

we are active in the communities we serve and strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship in 2019 air group donated 15 million in cash and inkind travel to over 1200 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 41000 hours of community service related to youth and education medical research and transportation one of our leadership principles is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees also in 2019 we launched lift our social and environmental impact program aimed at uniting all of our social and environmental impact efforts through this program our guests also showed great generosity donating 72 million miles in 2019 for donation to charitable organizations as recognition of our community leadership financial stability and the fact that our combined fleet is one of the youngest and most fuelefficient in north america we ranked higher than any other north american airline for the third year in a row on the dow jones sustainability index 

in 2019 we completed the majority of the remaining integration milestones from our acquisition of virgin america during the year alaska flight attendants began flying as integrated crews and our pilots adopted an integrated seniority list in july 2019 alaska aircraft maintenance technicians represented by the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa ratified an 

agreement bringing our last work group under a single collective bargaining agreement we also finished painting the remainder of the airbus fleet in the alaska livery and completed interior cabin renovations on 60 of the airbus fleet 

with the integration largely behind us we have shifted our focus towards our vision and strategy for the next five years this strategy has three major pillars 

people 

our success depends on our more than 24000 employees living our values every day to deliver awardwinning customer service as one team we know engaged employees deliver higher productivity superior execution and better guest experiences which is why investing in our people is imperative to our future success 

in 2019 we completed flight path  a program that brought all alaska and horizon employees together through leaderled sessions to inform engage and set the course for our business and culture aside from onetime programs we continue to communicate with employees through a variety of vehicles including weekly leader look ahead and periodic livestreamed webcasts to provide employees better information and a stronger connection to organizational priorities our efforts were recognized by forbes magazine who named alaska as one of the worlds best employers for the fifth year in a row for 2019 and as one of americas best employers for diversity in 2020 

aligning our employees goals with air groups goals has been an important contributor to our strong track record of accomplishments and financial performance the majority of alaska and horizon employees participate in our performancebased pay pbp and operational performance rewards opr programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to the companys strategy  including safety profitability ontime performance low costs customer loyalty and customer satisfaction over the last ten years our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one months pay for most employees in 2019 our employees earned more than 150 million under these incentive programs 

growth 

driving growth will require our focus in a variety of areas including a powerful brand optimized network and strong revenue generation 

• powerful brand  p roviding genuine and caring service to our guests is key to our success and loyalty to the alaska brand this service is demonstrated daily by our employees who are empowered to make the best choices for our guests as proof in 2019 alaska ranked first in the jd power and associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the 12th year in a row alaska was also recognized for excellent service by condé nast traveler and travel  leisure magazine for the second consecutive year continuing an achievement earned by virgin america for the preceding ten years 

our award winning mileage plan tm is another way we build longterm guest relationships and grow our brand we maintain the only distancebased frequent flier program in the united states which rewards all fliers regardless of the price they paid for their tickets in 2019 we increased our signup promotion for new cardholders to 40000 miles providing immediate utility of the program we also offered promotions like buy one get one free companion fares and continued popular redemption benefits including using miles for hotel redemptions with access to over 400000 hotels worldwide and adding el al airlines as a new global partner 

over the past two years we initiated a refresh of many of our amenities with the aim of highlighting our west coast roots from updated onboard offerings including fresh and local food to local craft beers and wines as well as updating our inair wifi to meet the evolving needs of our guests we will continue to innovate and evolve to provide our guests with the best experience work towards updated guestfacing amenities continued in 2019 with our flagship lounge opening in the north satellite at seatac airport as well as the announcement of a new lounge at san francisco international airport which is expected to open in the second half of 2020 we also strive to connect with west coast guests through key sponsorships including russell wilson the san jose sharks san francisco giants seattle mariners portland timbers seattles new nhl team and more 

• optimized network  the acquisition of virgin america positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the us with an unparalleled ability to serve west coast travelers we offer the highest guest relevance of any carrier from the west coast competition in our markets is significant and we know that we must defend our customer base as we grow our network presence by providing guests with an increased choice of schedule times and fares we are intensely focused on providing the most utility and routes to our guests from our west coast hub cities we lead all other airlines in 

nonstop markets daily flights and seat share in 2019 we began departures from paine fieldsnohomish county airport in everett washington to ten west coast markets we also optimized our current network and reallocated flying to expand offerings between the pacific northwest and california increasing network utility and providing more nonstop service on the west coast 

• revenue generation  in 2018 we introduced our saver fare product which offers greater choice for our guests allowing them to purchase and pay for the ticket type and other amenities they value most in 2019 our saver fare product provided meaningful revenue growth and is expected to continue to provide incremental revenue into 2020 this combined with synergies from the merger which are expected to hit their full run rate in 2021 and capacity growth will enable us to continue to grow our annual revenues innovation will also be key to growth in our revenues we will focus our efforts on merchandising and demand generation including through a variety of unique marketing strategies aimed at increasing revenues in typically offpeak periods

safety is the foundation of everything we do and remains our top priority we have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives alaska and horizon were the first us major airlines to receive faa validation and acceptance of their safety management systems sms in 2016 in 2018 we used sms to safely and consistently guide our integration with the legacy virgin america operation report it our mobile safety reporting application makes it easier for employees to file safety reports in 2018 100 of our alaska and horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the faas diamond certificate of excellence award marking the 17th consecutive year alaska has received the award and the 17th time in the last 19 years horizon has received this award in early 2020 we were again included as one of only two us airlines on the airlineratingscom list of the worlds top 20 safest airlines we believe that maintaining safe operations through adherence to welldefined processes and ensuring every air group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance the rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in north america for ontime performance and horizon was recognized once again as the leader in ontime performance in 2019 among regional airlines 

ultimately our success will be driven by our business model being flexible and innovative as we drive towards our pretax margin goals of 13 to 15 and our growth goals of 4 to 6 over the business cycle we know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while generating strong returns for our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure in 2019 our unit costs excluding fuel and special items increased 23 on a consolidated basis although our unit costs are expected to rise again in 2020 primarily due to general wage inflation higher engine maintenance on both our airbus and b737800 fleets and increased lease return costs associated with our airbus fleet we will continue our focus on lowering overhead improving productivity and managing vendor costs we are also actively managing fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which has increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 16 over the last five years we have a long track record of effective cost control and we remain keenly committed to protecting our unit cost advantage relative to competitors 

air group 

our airlines operate different aircraft and missions alaska operates a fleet of narrowbody passenger jets on primarily longerhaul capacity alaska contracts primarily with horizon and skywest airlines inc skywest for shorterhaul capacity such that alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates embraer 175 e175 regional jet aircraft and bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a cpa the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers the percentage of revenues by category is as follows

frequent flyer program 

alaska airlines mileage plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 18 airline partners by using an alaska airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program through alaska and our global partners mileage plan™ members have access to a large network of over 800 worldwide travel destinations further members can receive up to 40000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on alaska airlines purchases alaska airlines visa signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the us and platinum and world elite mastercard cardholders in canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to six people traveling on the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or our partner airlines for hotel stays via mileageplanhotelscom or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines we believe all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value than competing programs 

mileage plan™ revenues including those in the passenger revenue income statement line item represented approximately 13 of air groups total revenues in 2019 mileage plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers keeping existing customers actively engaged and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements frequent flyer agreements enable our mileage plan tm members to earn mileage credits and make redemptions on one of our 18 domestic and international partner airlines 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a blockspace arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing a more diverse network and schedule options to our guests 

alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

• offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage creditredemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on us and international airline partners 

• giving our mileage plan tm program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with both unaffiliated international carriers and carriers from all three major worldwide alliances 

  

• giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and 

  

• providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs 

  

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time our codeshare and interline agreements generated 5 5 and 6 of our total marketed revenues as of december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

the comprehensive summary of alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows 



a these airlines do not have their own frequent flyer program however alaskas mileage plan tm members can earn and redeem miles on these airlines route systems 

cargo and other revenue 

the company provides freight and mail services cargo the majority of cargo services are provided to commercial businesses and the united states postal service the company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination or is transferred to a thirdparty carrier for delivery 

the company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships hotel and car commissions and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as cargo and other revenue 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2019 the airline industry posted another year of profits and increases over 2018 primarily due to lower fuel prices although growth was impacted in 2019 following the grounding of the boeing 737 max aircraft airlines have continued to make significant investments in airports and new services to differentiate their customer service offering thus the level of competition is expected to continue to increase 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly impacted by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel aircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense or the price that we generally pay at the airport including taxes and fees plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18 to 25 of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the us 

the price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years has ranged from a low of 43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of 65 in 2018 for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 21 million of fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 9 million per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years over the last five years average annual west coast refining margin prices have fluctuated from a low of 13 per barrel in 2016 to a high of 26 per barrel in 2019 

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased 6 in 2019 after increasing 28 in 2018 and increasing 21 in 2017 

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



a includes information for virgin america for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 

b other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs 

we use crude oil call options as hedges against our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our price for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of declines in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft and executing on operational best practices are the best hedges against high fuel prices maintaining a young fuelefficient fleet helps to reduce our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta airlines inc delta who has significantly increased its capacity in seattle since 2013 approximately 76 of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta as we have grown in california and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings united airlines and southwest airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve our california and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the pacific northwest based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 1 in the first quarter of 2020 weighted based on our network 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests 

  

• safety 

safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do in early 2020 alaska was again ranked by airlineratingscom as one of only two us airlines in the top 20 safest airlines in the world in 2018 we also received our 17th diamond award of excellence from the federal aviation administration recognizing both alaska and horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training 

• fares and ancillary services 

ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing over 80 of total seats one of our advantages is our low fare with high value position in the industry however given the large concentration of industry capacity some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time we will defend our core markets and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe our strong financial position and low cost advantage enables us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders 

  

• customer service and reputation 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance and guest amenities  including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2019 alaska ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by jd power and associates for the 12th year in a row and was also named as the best us airline by condé nast traveler additionally in 2019 we opened our new flagship lounge in the north satellite of seatac airport and began work on our new lounge at san francisco international airport 

we are also in the process of reconfiguring our airbus aircraft which began in 2018 the new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests with one consistent brand experience across the mainline fleet airbus livery updates 

were completed in 2019 while the interior reconfiguration is expected to wrap up in early 2021 we began installation of nextgeneration gogo inflight satellite based wifi on our entire boeing and airbus fleets in 2018 which is planned to be complete in 2020 

our employees are a key element of our product we have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard we heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest satisfaction 

• routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we do not serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles our mileage plan™ offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 18 partner carriers for the fifth year in a row mileage plan™ was ranked first in us news and world reports list of best travel rewards programs 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets to some extent our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

• direct to customer it is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channel at alaskaaircom we believe direct sales through this channel are preferable from a branding and customer relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the guest and tailor offers accordingly as a result we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website 

  

• traditional and online travel agencies both traditional and online travel agencies typically use global distribution systems gds to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs 

  

• reservation call centers our call centers are located in phoenix az kent wa and boise id we generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers 

our sales by channel are as follows 



a includes results for virgin america for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel however we have significantly moderated the impact of seasonality of our operations through continued growth from the west coast to leisure destinations like hawaii and costa rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

• pricing initiatives by us or our competitors 

• changes in fuel costs 

• increases in competition at our primary airports 

• general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand 

  

• increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs and 

• air space and air traffic control delays particularly in seattle and san francisco 

  

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2019 we employed 24134 17919 at alaska 4301 at horizon and 1914 at mcgee air services active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 43 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2019 and 41 in 2018 

most major airlines including alaska and horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements cbas airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand 

as part of the integration we have been working to bring represented work groups under single cbas in 2019 our aircraft maintenance technicians represented by the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa ratified a twoyear contract extension bringing airbus and boeing technicians under a single cba now all five of our unionized groups at alaska are under joint collective agreements with integrated seniority lists in place 

at december 31 2019 labor unions represented 86 of alaska’s 43 of horizon’s and 87 of mcgee air services employees 

our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under the rla collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2019 were as follows 



a negotiations with alpa for an updated collective bargaining agreement are ongoing as of the date of this filing 

b as a result of amendments to mexican labor laws the company has up to four years to make changes to the existing labor agreements during that time the existing contracts remain in place 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2019 were as follows 



a negotiations with afa for an updated collective bargaining agreement are ongoing as of the date of this filing 

mcgee air services union contract at december 31 2019 was as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the the transportation security administration tsa and the faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

• dot a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates while airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the dot has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities essential air service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes international treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the us and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights the dot has been active in implementing a variety of “consumer protection” regulations covering subjects such 

as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the dot for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

• faa the faa through federal aviation regulations fars generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls periodically the faa issues airworthiness directives ads that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations all airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the faa from time to time for alleged violations of fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

• tsa airlines serving the us must operate a tsaapproved aircraft operator standard security program aossp and comply with tsa security directives sds and regulations under tsa authority we are required to collect a september 11 security fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the tsa for alleged violations of the aossp sds or security regulations we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the rla to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety and health programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

environmental 

  

we are also subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters both domestically and internationally domestic regulations that have an impact to our operations include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act resource conservation and recovery act clean water act safe drinking water act the comprehensive environmental response and compensation liability act the national environmental policy act emergency planning and community righttoknow act and the toxic substances control act many state and local environmental regulations exceed these federal regulations in the future there may be incremental legislation aimed at reduction of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and environmental restoration 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

the impacts of carbon emissions generated by the airline industry and the impact of those emissions on climate change have faced increased scrutiny we committed to carbon neutral international growth starting in 2020 through our commitment to carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation a global marketbased emissions offset program issued by the international civil aviation organization this does not have a direct impact on domestic flights however epa is expected to finalize a rule in 2020 on aircraft emission standards which will align with the international agreements 

over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets added fuelefficient winglets and flown efficient flight paths keeping with our industry commitments towards emission reduction in 2016 alaska airlines flew the first commercial flight in the us using a sustainable alternative jet fuel of a 20 blend made from forest residuals the fuel from that flight was produced by the northwest advanced renewables alliance nara led by washington state university alaska airlines has joined with others at seattle tacoma international airport and san francisco international 

airport to strengthen the pathway to commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel and through a partnership with neste continues to assess the increased use of biofuels as an alternative fuel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in addition alaska airlines and horizon air continue to utilize electric equipment at airports when we have the infrastructure to support it 

overall the total alaska mainline greenhouse gas emissions and intensity trend has decreased since 2009 and future goals have been set to continue reducing emissions intensity more broadly we know that being responsible for our impact is a critical part of delivering value for all those who depend on us – employees communities guests and owners – over the long term to that end we focused on addressing the breadth of our most significant environmental impact across emissions and waste as well as important social impacts alaska airlines leads the industry in inflight recycling and has reduced waste to landfill by over 15000 tons over the past decade in 2018 we were the first us airlines to remove plastic straws and stir sticks from our aircraft and in 2019 we launched a campaign called fillbeforeyoufly to engage our employees and guests in reducing plastic waste for more details on alaska’s emission reductions programs as well as status on other key environmental initiatives see alaska’s annual sustainability reports and environmental performance metrics on our website

although we do not currently anticipate that specific environmental regulation will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

 item 1a risk factors tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our company by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives this would harm our business 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

factors that might impact our operations include 

• congestion construction andor space constraints at airports specifically in our hub locations of seattle los angeles and san francisco 

• air traffic control problems 

• adverse weather conditions 

• lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc 

  

• increased security measures or breaches in security 

• contagious illness and fear of contagion 

  

• changes in international treaties concerning air rights 

• international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity and 

• other changes in business conditions 

due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that require substantial compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels these initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates these laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs new initiatives with employerfunded costs specifically those impacting washington state could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared 

to our competitors in recent years the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws particularly in california application of these laws may result in operational disruption increased litigation risk and impact on negotiated labor agreements 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business additionally changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance any instances of noncompliance could result in additional fines and fees 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

• significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel 

  

• significantly increase security and insurance costs 

  

• make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive 

  

• increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices 

  

• increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and 

  

• result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa 

  

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases 

  

we rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing among others 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

operation of a multiaircraft type fleet may present standardization and training challenges 

we strive for operational efficiency which has historically been aided by our operation of a single aircraft type fleet at each operating company with our acquisition of virgin america we added additional aircraft types to our mainline fleet certain procedures and training remain to be completed in order to ensure standardized operations for our crews and technicians as well as a seamless experience for our guests any failure to complete these procedures and training may create adverse impacts on guests employees and our ability to run an operationally efficient airline 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key west coast markets the resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit costreduction goals this is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations 

  

our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the west coast this results in a high concentration of our business in key west coast markets a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle portland and bay area hubs in 2019 passengers to and from seattle portland and the bay area accounted for 83 of our total guests 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing and airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on de havilland and embraer additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type as a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods should these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft we may not be able to grow our fleet at our intended rate which could impact our financial position specifically the boeing 737 max aircraft was grounded by the faa in march 2019 and remains grounded we have 32 max9 aircraft on order with 10 aircraft deliveries currently anticipated in 2020 if we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner our growth plans could be significantly impacted additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers this could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and will continue to have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our guests checkin using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs we are in the final stages of moving our primary data facility disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

failure to appropriately comply with information security rules and regulations or safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost 

we accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business many international and us jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing their own data security and privacy regulatory framework with which we our business partners and our corporate customers must comply there are also various bills pending at the us state and federal levels that could impose additional privacy and data security obligations this uncertain and increasingly complex regulatory environment may result in significant expenses associated with increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of personal information if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence decreased sales or be exposed to fraud any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and operations in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers to the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm 

cyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations reputation and financial condition 

our sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify because of these everevolving risks and regular attacks we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices however the nature of these attacks means that proper policies and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could lead to liquidity constraints that may restrict our activities 

we carry and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt related to aircraft lease and financing commitments although we aim to keep our leverage low due to our high fixed costs including such aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft 

as of december 31 2019 the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737700 800 900 900ers was approximately 89 years the average age of our a319 a320 and a321neo aircraft was approximately 86 years the average age of our owned e175 aircraft was approximately 16 years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 117 years currently our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in unplanned maintenance expense as we are required to return the leased planes in a contractually specified condition 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results 

in accordance with acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the virgin america acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually we could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties we can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

the companys brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media 

we operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media negative publicity including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees can spread rapidly through social media should the company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity the companys brand and reputation may be significantly harmed such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results 

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

labor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses in addition to costs associated with represented employee groups labors costs could also increase for nonunionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major us airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market although ample efforts have been dedicated to rightsizing our management structure following the merger with virgin america these increased labor costs may adversely affect our financial performance 

should employees engage in job actions such as slowdowns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during section 6 negotiations although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts the operation could be significantly impacted although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert management’s attention from other projects and issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the inability to attract retain and train qualified personnel or maintain our culture could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we compete against other major us airlines for pilots aircraft technicians and other skilled labor as more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age the us airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage attrition beyond normal levels the inability to attract new pilots or our key vendors inability to attract and retain mechanics or other skilled labor positions could negatively impact our operating results as a result our business prospects could be harmed additionally we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages or pay increased rates to our vendors to retain these positions this would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our financial position 

our success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a united culture with cohesive values and goals much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty failure to maintain and grow the alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies as part of this process we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend

  

we are a party to routine litigation matters incidental to our business management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to materially affect our financial position or results of operations this forwardlooking statement is based on management’s current understanding of the relevant law and facts and it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries 

in 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all virgin america flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of california and city of san francisco wage and hour laws the court certified a class of approximately 1800 flight attendants in november 2016 the company believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit 

in july 2018 the court granted in part plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding virgin america and alaska airlines as a successorininterest to virgin america responsible for various damages and penalties sought by the class members on february 4 2019 the court entered final judgment against virgin america and alaska airlines in the amount of approximately 78 million it did not award injunctive relief against alaska airlines 

the company is seeking an appellate court ruling that the california laws on which the judgment is based are invalid as applied to national airlines pursuant to the us constitution and federal law and for other employment law and improper class certification reasons the company remains confident that a higher court will respect the federal preemption principles that were enacted to shield interstate common carriers from a patchwork of state and local wage and hour regulations such as those at issue in this case and agree with the companys other bases for appeal for these reasons no loss has been accrued 

the company is involved in other litigation around the application of state and local employment laws like many air carriers our defenses are similar to those identified above including that the state and local laws are preempted by federal law and are unconstitutional because they impede interstate commerce none of these additional disputes are material

year in review 

in 2019 we posted our 16th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis and an adjusted pretax margin of 12 which ranks among the top quartile of the industry our pretax income was 10 billion compared to 585 million in 2018 our 2019 pretax income on an adjusted basis a nongaap financial measure was 11 billion an increase of 43 from the same measure in 2018 adjusted pretax income for 2019 excludes 44 million of mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america and 6 million of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments 

the increase in adjusted pretax income was driven largely by an increase in operating revenues of 517 million and a decrease in fuel expense of 58 million due to lower fuel prices as compared to the prior year these improvements were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding fuel and special items of 243 million 

revenue growth of 517 million was largely driven by initiatives we launched in late 2018 and early 2019 most notably our new saver fare product and continued network expansion resulting in capacity growth of about 2 

the 243 million increase in operating expenses excluding fuel and special items was largely due to growth in wages and benefits cost from new collective bargaining agreements and growth in our overall business requiring an increase in frontline staffing one of these agreements was a joint collective bargaining agreement with our aircraft mechanics marking the last of the work groups to integrate from the virgin america merger this was a significant achievement and marks 2019 as the year in which we completed substantially all of the integration milestones 

see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure

since 2007 we have repurchased 62 million shares of common stock for 17 billion for an average price of approximately 2789 per share in 2019 we increased our quarterly dividend 9 from 032 per share to 035 per share and subsequent to december 31 2019 we announced a 7 increase to 0375 per share for 2020 overall we returned 248 million to shareholders during 2019 we currently expect to increase capital returns to shareholders in 2020 to approximately 430 million of which approximately 250 million will be from share repurchases 

labor update 

in july 2019 our aircraft technicians represented by amfa ratified an agreement to integrate airbus technicians into the collective bargaining agreement with boeing technicians as well as extend the contract term by two years the ratification of the agreement brings all of our labor groups under single collective bargaining agreements an important milestone less than three years after the merger with virgin america in september 2019 alaskas clerical office passenger service ramp service and stores agents represented by the iam ratified new fiveyear contracts both the iam and amfa agreements included signing bonuses and wage rate increases which were implemented in the third quarter 

outlook 

  

with the acquisition of virgin america largely behind us in 2020 we will shift our focus to executing on our new fiveyear strategy integral to this longterm plan will be achieving 13 to 15 pretax margins and 4 to 6 annual capacity growth over the business cycle our revenue initiatives including our saver fare product provided meaningful revenue improvements in 2019 and are expected to continue to provide incremental revenue in 2020 benefits from the synergies of the merger also provided positive impacts to our 2019 pretax margin with the full runrate expected by 2021 through crossfleeting we were able to optimize the use of our fleet by moving largergauge lower unit cost aircraft into markets with high demand 

in 2020 we anticipate the continuation of these initiatives and synergies will provide an incremental 125 million of revenue we also expect additional revenue from initiatives we will be launching throughout 2020 in addition we will continue our work on notable guest experience enhancement projects which are already underway by the end of the year we expect our entire mainline fleet will be equipped with highspeed satellite wifi and that the majority of the interiors of our airbus fleet will be retrofitted to align with the boeing fleet allowing for lower unitcosts and incremental premium revenue on airbus aircraft work will also continue with the port of seattle to open a stateoftheart 20gate north satellite concourse at seatac airport to be completed in 2021 these improvements combined with our ongoing rotation of fresh onboard menu offerings refreshed aircraft interiors and optimization of our network will continue to provide our guests with more options at a significant value 

we expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2020 by approximately 3 to 4 compared to 2 growth in 2019 current schedules indicate competitive capacity will increase by roughly one point in the first quarter of 2020 our capacity guidance is highly dependent on the return to service of the boeing 737 max aircraft our current delivery schedule indicates that ten 737 max aircraft will be delivered in 2020 three of which were delayed from 2019 plus seven originally contracted for delivery in 2020 should the grounding of the aircraft further delay those ten deliveries beyond our current expectations our capacity growth could be negatively impacted 

given another year of slower growth and increased cost pressure from higher wages airport costs and maintenance costs we expect unit costs to increase approximately 2 in 2020 this expectation excludes the impacts of any new labor agreements that might be reached during the year in order to reach our longterm margin goals of 13 to 15 we will mitigate cost pressures through a continued focus on higher productivity and lower overhead we believe that our product our operation our engaged employees our awardwinning service and our competitive mileage plan™ combined with our strong balance sheet and focus on low costs give us the ability to compete successfully in the markets we serve and generate meaningful profit margins 

results of operations 

adjusted nongaap results and pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because 

• by excluding fuel expense and certain special items including mergerrelated and other costs from our unit metrics we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our nonfuel cost initiatives our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs so even a small reduction in nonfuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results in addition we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact of and trends in companyspecific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity airport costs maintenance costs etc which are more controllable by management 

• cost per asm casm excluding fuel and certain special items such as mergerrelated costs is one of the most important measures used by management and by the air group board of directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance 

• adjusted income before income tax and casm excluding fuel and other items as specified in our plan documents are important metrics for the employee incentive plan which covers the majority of air group employees 

• casm excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry the measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors 

• disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items we believe that disclosing the impact of certain items such as mergerrelated costs and marktomarket hedging adjustments is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines 

• although we disclose our passenger unit revenues we do not nor are we able to evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the midtolong term although we believe it is useful to evaluate nonfuel unit costs for the reasons noted above we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

2019 compared with 2018 

our consolidated net income for 2019 was 769 million or 619 per diluted share compared to net income of 437 million or 352 per diluted share in 2018 

excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs and marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments our adjusted consolidated net income for 2019 was 798 million or 642 per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 554 million or 446 per share in 2018 the following table reconciles our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share eps during the full year 2019 and 2018 to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

b see reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly related gaap measure in the accompanying pages 

c data presented includes information related to flights operated by horizon and thirdparty carriers 

d information for 2017 has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of new accounting standards 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased 517 million or 6 during 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue 

on a consolidated basis passenger revenue for 2019 increased by 464 million or 6 on a 2 increase in capacity and a 42 increase in unit revenues the capacity increase was driven by the continued expansion of our network and fleet growth over the past year unit revenues increased largely due to our current year revenue initiatives including our saver fare product implemented as a part of a broader plan to drive revenue growth and the realization of synergies from our acquisition of virgin america 

mileage plan other revenue 

on a consolidated basis mileage plan other revenue increased 31 million or 7 as compared to 2018 primarily due to increased miles purchased by our affinity card partner consistent with the overall growth in cardholders 

cargo and other revenue 

on a consolidated basis cargo and other revenue increased 22 million or 11 from 2018  the increase is primarily attributable to increased freight and mail volumes from our three freighters as a result of the annualization of new contracts entered into late in 2018 and revenue from our subleased slots at laguardia and reagan national airports 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased 97 million or 1 compared to 2018 we consider it useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2018 are more fully described below 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense as defined below and the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases aircraft fuel expense can be volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease 

raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense decreased 58 million or 3 compared to 2018 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



raw fuel expense per gallon decreased 6 due to lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as the refining costs associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2019 was driven by a 12 decrease in crude oil prices partially offset by a 9 increase in refining margins as compared to the prior year fuel gallons consumed increased by 23 million or 3 consistent with the increase in capacity of 2 and a 3 increase in block hours 

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices have on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 16 million in 2019 compared to gains of 24 million in 2018 these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement 

as of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to increase approximately 4 in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019 due to increasing crude oil prices offset by a slight decrease in refining margins as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased during 2019 by 180 million or 8 compared to 2018 the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages and payroll taxes increased by a combined 114 million on a 22 increase in ftes the increase in ftes is attributable to the growth in our business additionally the increase in wages is driven by the recognition of approximately 24 million in onetime costs following the ratification of the amfa and iam contracts in the third quarter as well as the impact of increased wage rates for our labor groups as compared to the prioryear period 

medical and other benefits expense increased 66 million or 27 primarily due to fte growth rising medical costs a greater occurrence of highdollar value claims in 2019 as compared to the prior year and increases in the obligation for our pilots longterm disability plan 

we expect wages and benefits expense to be higher in 2020 compared to 2019 on an approximate 3 increase in ftes our guidance does not include the impact of any future agreements we may reach with represented work groups in 2020 most notably our mainline pilots whose contract becomes amendable in april 2020 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased to 163 million in 2019 from 147 million in 2018 due to a higher wage base upon which the achievement percentage is applied as well as a greater achievement of our stated goals as compared to the prior year 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased by 2 million compared to 2018 although not a significant increase overall core maintenance costs were higher resulting from a larger volume of airframe and engine maintenance checks as compared to the prior year particularly on our airbus fleet this was partially offset by lower costs associated with our leased airbus aircraft 

we expect aircraft maintenance expense to increase 17 to 19 in 2020 due to increased volume of engine maintenance checks on our airbus and b737800 fleets as well as increased costs associated with the return of certain leased airbus aircraft 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense increased 16 million or 5 compared to 2018 primarily due to the the addition of two a321neos to our mainline fleet and the annualization of rent on our leased e175s under the cpa agreement with skywest 

we expect aircraft rent to be flat in 2020 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased 32 million or 6 compared to 2018 primarily driven by a 2 increase in capacity and rate increases at many of our hub airports 

we expect landing fees and other rental expense to grow 9 to 12 in 2020 as we continue to add capacity to our network we also expect rate increases at many airports we serve specifically our hubs as significant capital programs are underway and will be included in our lease rates 

selling expenses 

selling expenses decreased by 13 million or 4 compared to 2018 due to improvements in our credit card rates as well as decreased spending on advertising as compared to the prior year 

we expect selling expense to decrease slightly in 2020 due primarily to ongoing reductions in overall advertising and sponsorship spend and an expected shift in distribution to lowercost channels 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 25 million or 6 compared to 2018 primarily due to the addition of four owned b737900ers and four owned e175s to our fleet since december 31 2018 

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase 4 to 6 in 2020 primarily due to the full year impact of depreciation on aircraft delivered in 2019 and the impact of 737 max aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2020 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements increased 12 million or 8 in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase is primarily due to a 33 increase in capacity flown by skywest as compared to the prior year and higher cpa rates 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to be flat in 2020 as there is no expected growth in the number of aircraft to be operated by skywest 

special items  mergerrelated costs 

we recorded 44 million of mergerrelated costs in 2019 associated with our ongoing integration of former virgin america operations compared to 87 million in 2018 costs incurred in 2019 consisted primarily of expenses associated with airbus flight attendant and pilot vacation balances which were subject to a onetime trueup in accordance with the integrated labor agreements as well as certain technology integration costs we expect to incur mergerrelated costs in 2020 although at a lesser rate 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2019 we recorded net nonoperating expense of 47 million compared to 58 million in 2018 the decrease is primarily due to lower interest expense as compared to 2018 as a result of an overall reduction in our debt balance and a reduction in average interest rates 

additional segment information 

refer to note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

mainline adjusted pretax profit was 993 million in 2019 compared to 809 million in 2018 the 184 million increase in pretax profit was primarily driven by a 318 million increase in mainline operating revenue and a 63 million decrease in mainline fuel expense these increases were partially offset by a 201 million increase in mainline nonfuel operating expenses 

mainline revenue increased primarily due to a 3 increase in yields and a slight increase in load factor as compared to the prior year lower raw fuel prices offset by an increase in gallons consumed drove the decrease in mainline fuel expense nonfuel operating expense increased due to a 24 million signing bonus and higher wage rates from new contracts with our iam and amfa employees as well as increased aircraft ownership and maintenance costs 

regional 

our regional operations generated a pretax profit of 2 million in 2019 compared to a pretax loss of 100 million in 2018 the improvement was primarily attributable to a 197 million increase in operating revenues partially offset by 73 million higher nonfuel operating expense and 33 million increase in fuel costs increased revenues and nonfuel operating expenses is primarily driven by the 13 increase in capacity 

horizon 

horizon achieved a pretax profit of 38 million in 2019 compared to 27 million in 2018 the change was primarily driven by a 22 increase in capacity growth attributable to four e175 aircraft added to horizons fleet over the past year and improved cost management through better productivity and improved operational performance 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

• our existing cash and marketable securities balance of 15 billion and our expected cash from operations 

  

• our 133 unencumbered aircraft in the operating fleet as of december 31 2019 that could be financed if necessary and 

• our combined bank lineofcredit facilities with no outstanding borrowings of 400 million information about these facilities can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2019 we took delivery of four owned b737900er and four owned e175 aircraft and made net debt payments totaling 608 million undertaken as part of our broader plan of reducing balance sheet leverage and lowering interest expense as part of this overall reduction plan as of december 31 2019 we have paid off approximately 75 of the debt sourced to fund the virgin america acquisition we also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling 173 million and repurchasing 75 million of our common stock because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance we are one of only three airlines in the us with investment grade credit ratings 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



debttocapitalization adjusted for operating leases 



a following the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on january 1 2019 this represents the total capitalized operating lease liability whereas prior year periods were calculated utilizing the present value of aircraft lease payments this change had no meaningful impact to the ratio 

net adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization special items and rent 



the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion in 2019 compared to 12 billion in 2018 the increase of 527 million is primarily due to a 332 million increase in our net income and an increase in advance ticket sales on an expected increase in first quarter capacity as compared to the prior year these increases were partially offset by a 65 million voluntary pension contribution 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment to make debt payments and to return capital to shareholders 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 791 million during 2019 compared to 631 million in 2018 our capital expenditures were 696 million or 264 million lower than in 2018 primarily driven by lower cash outlays for deliveries of and advance deposits on aircraft in 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018 our net purchases of marketable securities were 136 million in 2019 compared to net sales of 282 million in 2018 the shift to net purchases is primarily driven by stronger operating cash flows as compared to 2018 internally we analyze and manage our cash and marketable securities balance in the aggregate 

cash used in financing activities 

  

cash used in financing activities was 813 million during 2019 compared to cash used in financing activities of 647 million in 2018 during the year we made debt payments of 11 billion repurchased 75 million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 173 million these payments were partially offset by the receipt of funds from new secured debt financing of 450 million in 2019 this compares to our activity in 2018 which consisted of net debt payments of 468 million repurchases of 50 million of our common stock and cash dividend payments of 158 million 

we plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand internally generated cash from operations along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lines of credit 

  

we have three credit facilities with availability totaling 516 million including one 250 million credit facility one 150 million credit facility and one 116 million credit facility we have secured letters of credit against the 116 million facility but have no plans to borrow using either of the two remaining facilities 

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase and lease commitments 

  

as of december 31 2019 we have firm orders to purchase 35 aircraft we also have cancelable purchase commitments for 30 airbus a320neo aircraft with deliveries from 2023 through 2025 we could incur a loss of predelivery payments and credits as a cancellation fee we also have options to acquire up to 37 additional 737 max aircraft with deliveries from 2021 through 2024 and 30 e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2021 to 2023 in addition to the 32 e175 aircraft currently operated by skywest in our regional fleet we have options in future periods to add regional capacity by having skywest operate up to eight more e175 aircraft 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 750 million in 2020 pending 737 max deliveries and any decision made for future aircraft orders we have included in the table below the three undelivered aircraft from 2019 in our 2020 delivery schedule the total of ten deliveries is subject to change based on the ongoing faa grounding of the aircraft 

the following table summarizes our contractual fleet count by year as of february 12 2020 



a the expected fleet counts at december 31 2020 and 2021 reflect contractual lease returns and is subject to change pending our longterm fleet decisions and strategies for future acquisition of aircraft 

b aircraft are either owned or leased by horizon or operated under capacity purchase agreement with a third party 

c all three of our boeing 737 max9 aircraft that were originally scheduled for delivery in 2019 have been shifted to 2020 in light of the max grounding 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through cash from operations longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 



contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our obligations as of december 31 2019 for agreements with variable terms amounts included reflect our minimum obligations 



a for variablerate debt future obligations are shown above using interest rates forecast as of december 31 2019 

b primarily comprised of nonaircraft lease costs associated with capacity purchase agreements 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 363 million at december 31 2019 compared to a 367 million unfunded position at december 31 2018 this results in an 86 funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 84 funded as of december 31 2018 we made a voluntary contribution of65 million to the plans in 2019 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the shortterm are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices usage of net operating losses whether bonus depreciation provisions are available any future tax reform efforts at the federal level as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2019 we made tax payments net of refunds totaling 31 million and had an effective tax rate of 243 we believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

frequent flyer programs 

  

alaskas mileage plan™ loyalty program awards mileage credits to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners referred to as flown miles we also sell services including miles for transportation companion fare™ certificates bag fee waivers and access to our brand and customer lists to major banks that offer alaska cobrand credit cards to a lesser extent miles for transportation are also sold to other nonairline partners such as hotels and car rental agencies the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or eligible airline partners and for nonairline products such as hotels as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide future travel 

mileage credits and the various other services we sell under our loyalty program represent performance obligations that are part of a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement accounting guidance requires that we use a relative standalone selling price allocation to allocate consideration received to the material performance obligations in these contracts our relative standalone selling price allocation models are refreshed when contracts originate or are materially modified we also update our model annually based on observed volumes 

  

at december 31 2019 we had approximately 262 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate deferred revenue balance of 20 billion the deferred revenue resulting from our relative selling price allocations requires significant management judgment there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or expenses the most significant assumptions are described below 

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold 

  

we estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation including mileage credits by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimate the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables 

2 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel breakage 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem mileage credits for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program™ and historical award redemption patterns 

we regularly review significant mileage plan™ assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil component of jet fuel limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against fuel price increases we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2019 would change the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 3 million or 33 million 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 11 million at december 31 2019 compared to a portfolio value of 4 million at december 31 2018 we did not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2019 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have a number of interest rate swaps that fix the interest rates on certain variablerate debt agreements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on average variablerate debt held during 2019 would have correspondingly changed our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 5 million our variablerate debt represents approximately 69 and 70 of our total longterm debt as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 approximately 717 million of the companys total variablerate notes payable were effectively fixed via interest rate swaps at december 31 2019 

our exposure to interest rate variability is further mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average one point more than they did in 2019 interest income would increase by approximately 12 million 

our variablerate instruments including longterm debt interest rate swaps and credit facilities all make reference to the london interbank offered rate libor as the interest rate benchmark it is expected that after 2021 libor will be discontinued as a reference rate in the event of the discontinuance of libor we will need to transition our liborbased contracts to a mutually agreedupon alternate benchmark rate which effectively places the lenders and the company in the same economic position that existed immediately prior to the discontinuation of libor at this time we do not anticipate that the discontinuance of libor will materially impact our liquidity or financial position

 item 1 our business 

tableend

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines alaska and horizon alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of alaska horizon air is a washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981 it was acquired by air group in 1986 virgin america has been a member of air group since it was acquired in 2016 in 2018 virgin america and alaska combined operating certificates to become a single airline and legally merged into a single entity the company also includes mcgee air services an aviation services provider that was established as a whollyowned subsidiary of alaska in 2016 

  

alaska and horizon operate as separate airlines with individual business plans competitive factors and economic risks together with our regional partner airlines we fly to 115  destinations with over 1200  daily departures through an expansive network across the united states mexico canada and costa rica with global airline partners we provide our guests with a network of more than 900  destinations worldwide during 2018  we carried an alltime high 46 million  guests and earned consolidated net income under generally accepted accounting principles gaap of 437 million  compared to net income of 960 million  in 2017  our adjusted net income was 554 million  which excludes mergerrelated costs special items and marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments refer to results of operations in managements discussion and analysis for our reconciliation of nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

we organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments which are as follows 

 

our purpose is creating an airline people love the ing is to recognize that we are never done we are continually working to improve we believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively it is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance but also our people the communities we serve and the environment 

in 2018  we focused much of our energy on the integration of virgin america completing over 95  of our integration milestones in january 2018  alaska and virgin america received a single operating certificate soc from the federal aviation administration faa which recognizes alaska and virgin america as one airline in april 2018  we transitioned to a single passenger service system pss which allows us to provide one reservation system one website and one inventory of flights to our guests this transition to a single pss enables us to unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition and to provide consistent branding to our guests at all airport gates ticketing and checkin areas 

the two most important milestones we have yet to complete include combining the maintenance operations of boeing and airbus and reconfiguring our airbus fleet in 2018  we painted 33  airbus aircraft with the alaska livery and we are in process of reconfiguring all airbus aircraft to achieve a cabin experience for our guests that is consistent with our boeing fleet in early 2019 we will also complete the integration of our crew management systems and aim to reach a collective bargaining agreement with our aircraft technicians the last remaining labor group that has not yet reached a joint collective bargaining agreement 

with the integration largely behind us we remain committed to our vision to become the favorite airline for people on the west coast the acquisition of virgin america positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the us with an unparalleled ability to serve west coast travelers to do so we believe we need to meet our guests evolving needs by offering a relevant network and schedule upgrading our onboard offerings and retaining our unique west coast vibe some of the more notable product enhancements underway include adding highspeed satellite connectivity to our entire boeing and airbus fleets updating and expanding our airport lounges and working with the port of seattle to open a stateoftheart 20gate north satellite concourse 

 4 

at seatac airport including a 15000 squarefoot flagship lounge we have also introduced new food and beverage menus which include more fresh local and healthy offerings including salads protein plates and fresh snacks as well as new beverage offerings including craft beers juices and an updated wine selection 

we are also active in the communities we serve and strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship in 2018  air group donated 17 million  in cash and inkind travel to over 1300  charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 44000  hours of community service related to youth and education medical research and transportation one of our leadership principles is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees as recognition of our community leadership financial stability and the fact that our combined fleet is one of the youngest and most fuelefficient in north america we ranked higher than any other north american airline for the second year in a row on the dow jones sustainability index 

we continued to generate profits in 2018  marking our 15th  consecutive year with adjusted net income our liquidity and capital position remain strong positioning us among other highquality industrial companies due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three us airlines with investment grade credit ratings the cash generated by our continued success enables us to invest in our business to deliver profitable growth enhance our guests experience and improve our financial position 

looking to the future our vision is to become the west coasts favorite airline to do this we will focus on the following areas 

safety   

safety is the most important thing we do we have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives alaska and horizon were the first us major airlines to receive faa validation and acceptance of their safety management systems sms in 2016 in 2018 we continued using sms to safely and consistently guide our integration with the legacy virgin america operation report it a new mobile safety reporting application made it easier than ever for employees to file safety reports once again in 2018 100 of our alaska and horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the faas diamond certificate of excellence award this marks the 17th consecutive year alaska has received the award and the 17th time in the last 19 years horizon has received this award in 2018 we were also included as one of only two us airlines on the airlineratingscom list of the worlds top 20 safest airlines we also believe that maintaining safe operations through adherence to welldefined processes and ensuring every air group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance the rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in north america for ontime performance and horizon recognized as the leader in ontime performance in 2018 among regional airlines 

delivering low costs 

we believe that our lowfare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing significant value to our guests we also know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while generating strong returns for our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure in 2018  our unit costs excluding fuel and special items increased 31  on a consolidated basis although our unit costs are expected to rise again in 2019 primarily due to slower capacity growth a higher mix of regional flying and general wage inflation we have increased our focus on lowering overhead improving productivity and managing vendor costs we are also actively managing fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which has increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 13  over the last five years as we work to finalize the integration of our airbus operations we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals we have a long track record of effective cost control and we remain keenly committed to protecting our unit cost advantage relative to competitors 

enabling our advantage 

paramount to becoming the west coast favorite airline is enabling and demonstrating our advantage we do so by delivering great service great value and providing generous rewards 



 5 

 

we are also focused on providing meaningful utility and routes to our guests from our west coast hub cities we lead all other airlines in nonstop markets daily flights and seat share in the past two years we have significantly expanded our network utility in california adding 21 new routes and nearly doubling our number of daily flights we also have focused our new routes announced for 2019 in those areas which connect our guests to high demand markets in the lower 48 states and hawaii including 18  daily departures from paine fieldsnohomish county airport in everett washington to eight  west coast markets expected to launch in march 2019 

 

 

being one team 

our success depends on our more than 23000  employees living our values every day to deliver superior customer service as a single team we know engaged employees deliver higher productivity superior execution and better guest experiences which is why investing in our people is imperative to our future success 

in 2018 we focused on our culture to ensure every employee feels valued informed and engaged it is a top priority to ensure our employees know where we are where we are going and how we will get there to this end we have implemented new and enhanced communication vehicles including weekly leader look ahead and periodic livestreamed webcasts to provide employees better information and a stronger connection to organizational priorities additionally we launched flight path  a program that brings employees together through leaderled sessions to inform engage and set the course for our business and culture our efforts were recognized by forbes magazine in 2018 who recognized alaska as one of americas best employers for the fourth year in a row 

aligning our employees goals with air groups goals has been an important contributor to our strong track record of accomplishments and financial performance the majority of alaska and horizon employees participate in our performancebased pay pbp and operational performance rewards opr programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to the companys strategy including safety profitability ontime performance low costs customer loyalty and customer satisfaction over the last five years our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one months pay for most employees in 2018 we rewarded our employees with 147 million  under these incentive programs

air group 

our airlines operate different aircraft and missions alaska operates a fleet of narrowbody passenger jets on primarily longerhaul capacity alaska contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula aviation services inc penair a subsidiary of ravn air group inc for shorterhaul capacity such that alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates embraer 175 e175 regional jet aircraft and bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a cpa the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers the percentage of revenues by category is as follows 



 

we deploy aircraft into the network in ways that we believe will best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce the impacts of seasonality 

the percentage of our capacity by region is as follows 



 

mainline 

our mainline operations include boeing 737 b737 and airbus family a319 a320 and a321neo jet service offered by alaska we offer extensive passenger service from the western us throughout the contiguous united states alaska hawaii canada mexico and costa rica our largest concentrations of departures are in seattle portland and the bay area we also offer cargo service throughout our network and have dedicated cargo aircraft that operate primarily to and within the state of alaska 

  

in 2018  we carried 36 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations at december 31 2018  our mainline operating fleet consisted of 162  boeing 737 jet aircraft and 71  airbus a320 family jet aircraft compared to 154  b737 aircraft and 67  airbus aircraft as of december 31 2017

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



 

regional 

  

our regional operations consist of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2018  our regional operations carried approximately 10 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and carries approximately 71  of air groups regional revenue passengers 

based on 2018  horizon passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our most significant concentration of regional activity was in seattle and portland at december 31 2018  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 26  e175 jet aircraft and 39  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft the regional fleet operated by skywest consisted of 32  e175 aircraft 

the percentage of regional passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



frequent flyer program 

alaska airlines mileage plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 17  airline partners by using an alaska airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program through alaska and our global partners mileage plan™ members have access to a large network of over 900  worldwide travel destinations further members can receive up to 40000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on alaska airlines purchases alaska airlines visa signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the us and platinum and world elite mastercard cardholders in canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to six people traveling on the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or our partner airlines for hotel stays via mileageplanhotelscom or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines we believe all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value for their travel 

mileage plan™ revenues including those in the passenger revenue income statement line item represented approximately 13  of air groups total revenues in 2018  mileage plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 

 8 

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements frequent flyer agreements enable our mileage plan tm  members to earn mileage credits and make redemptions on one of our 17  domestic and international partner airlines 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests 

alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time our codeshare and interline agreements generated 5  6  and 8  of our total marketed revenues as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

 9 

the comprehensive summary of alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows 



 

cargo and other revenue 

the company provides freight and mail services cargo the majority of cargo services are provided to commercial businesses and the united states postal service the company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination or is transferred to a thirdparty carrier for delivery 

the company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships hotel and car commissions and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as cargo and other revenue 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2018  the airline industrys profits declined when compared to 2017  primarily due to rising fuel prices higher labor costs and increased competitive fare actions reducing ticket prices despite some of these headwinds the industry reported profits in 2018  in the current industry environment airlines are making significant investments in airports more fuelefficient planes and new services to differentiate their customer service offering thus the level of competition is expected to continue to increase 

 10 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18  to 32  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the us 

  

the price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of 43  per barrel in 2016  to a high of 93  in 2014  for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 20 million  of fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 8 million  per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years over the last five years average annual west coast refining margin prices have fluctuated between 13  per barrel to a high of 24  per barrel in 2018  

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased   28  in 2018  after increasing   21  in 2017  and decreasing   19  in 2016  

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



 

we use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices air groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 769  asmsg in 2014  to 779  asmsg in 2018  maintaining a young fuelefficient fleet has not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta airlines inc delta who has significantly increased its capacity in seattle over the past several years approximately 77  of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta as we have grown in california and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings united airlines and southwest airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve our california and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the pacific northwest based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 4  in the first quarter of 2019  weighted based on our network 

 11 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests 

  

 

ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing over 80  of total seats one of our advantages is our low fare with high value position in the industry however given the large concentration of industry capacity some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time we will defend our core markets and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe our strong financial position and low cost advantage enables us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders 

 

safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do in 2018  we were again ranked by airlineratingscom as one of only two us airlines in the top 20 safest airlines in the world we also received our 17th diamond award of excellence from the federal aviation administration recognizing both alaska and horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training 

  

 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance guest amenities—including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2018  alaska airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by jd power and associates for the 11th  year in a row additionally in 2018  we completed installation of premium class service on our b737 aircraft which provides extra legroom early boarding premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage 

we also began reconfiguring the interior and livery of our airbus fleet in 2018 the new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests with one consistent brand experience across the mainline fleet airbus livery updates are expected to be complete in 2019 while the interior reconfiguration is expected to wrap up in early 2020 we also began installation of nextgeneration gogo inflight satellite based wifi on our entire boeing and airbus fleets which is also planned to be complete in 2020 

our employees are a key element of our product we have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard we heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys 

 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we do not serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles our mileage plan™ offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 17  partner carriers in 2018  we added finnair to our list of codeshare partners and a number of new interline partners 

 12 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets to some extent our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



 

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel however we have significantly moderated the impact of seasonality of our operations through continued growth from the west coast to leisure destinations like hawaii and costa rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• changes in fuel costs 

 

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weatherrelated risks over larger route systems we also are 

 13 

susceptible to congested air space and air traffic control delays due to our heavy concentration of departures from seattle and san francisco 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2018  we employed 23376   17520  at alaska 4052  at horizon and 1804  at mcgee air services active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 41  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2018  and 39  in 2017  additionally in the first quarter of 2018 we paid approximately 25 million  in onetime bonuses to employees as a result of tax reform 

most major airlines including alaska and horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements cba airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand 

as part of the integration we have been working to bring represented work groups under single collective bargaining agreements the process for combining work groups begins with the union filing a petition with the national mediation board nmb at which point the nmb performs a review to assess a ‘single carrier determination’ for the airlines following this single carrier determination the nmb makes a representation determination depending on size of the premerger bargaining units and will either extend the certification if one is significantly larger than the other or require a vote once representation is determined the nmb certifies the union as the bargaining representative for the work group the parties must also work together to achieve agreed upon single collective bargaining agreements integration also requires the premerger work groups to agree upon and finalize integrated seniority lists as of december 31 2018  four of our five unionized groups at alaska have joint collective agreements and integrated seniority lists in place this is a major milestone just 24 months after the official close of the acquisition of virgin america in december 2016 a tentative agreement reached with the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa was rejected by boeing technicians we will continue to work with amfa and our technicians to reach a transition agreement 

at december 31 2018  labor unions represented 84  of alaska’s 45  of horizon’s and 87  of mcgee air services employees 

our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under the rla collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2018  were as follows 





 14 

only for boeing qualified mechanics and excludes legacy virgin america mechanics as they are not currently under a collective bargaining agreement 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2018  were as follows 



mcgee air services union contract at december 31 2018  was as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the the transportation security administration tsa and the faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

 16 

  

 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

in the future there may be legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

 17 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our company by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives this would harm our business 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

factors that might impact our operations include 

 

 

 

   

 

   

 

 19 

 

 

due to our concentration of flights along the west coast and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to air traffic control delays than our competition additionally due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels these initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates these laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs new initiatives with employerfunded costs specifically those impacting washington state could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared to our competitors 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business additionally changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance any instances of noncompliance could result in additional fines and fees 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 20 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases 

  

we rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing among others 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

completion of remaining virgin america integration activities may continue to incur substantial expenses 

although the majority of our integration efforts have been completed we continue to devote management attention resources and costs to integrating the business practices and operations of virgin america certain milestones must still be completed which will lead to additional costs any failure to complete these milestones in a seamless manner may create adverse impacts on guests suppliers employees and other constituents 

success of the merger is also dependent on cultivating a united culture with cohesive values and goals much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty failure to maintain and grow the alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies as part of this process we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs 

our plans to discontinue use of the virgin america brand in 2019 are subject to an agreement with certain entities affiliated with the virgin group 

we are in the process of discontinuing all uses of the virgin america brand in our operations and anticipate the process will be complete in 2019 the virgin group licensor may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of a number of specified events including if we commit a material breach of our obligations under the agreement that is uncured for more than 10 business days if we lose our rights to use the virgin america brand before we have discontinued all uses of the brand our current plan would need to be accelerated which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key west coast markets the resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we continue to strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit costreduction goals this is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns therefore our financial results may suffer 

 21 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations 

  

our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the west coast this results in a high concentration of our business in key west coast markets a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle portland and bay area hubs in 2018  passengers to and from seattle portland and the bay area accounted for 82  of our total guests 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing and airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier and embraer additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type as a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers this could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

 22 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our guests checkin using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs we are in the final stages of moving our primary data facility disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

failure to appropriately comply with information security rules and regulations or safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost 

we accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business many international and us jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing their own data security and privacy regulatory framework with which we our business partners and our corporate customers must comply there are also various bills pending at the us state and federal levels that could impose additional privacy and data security obligations this uncertain and increasingly complex regulatory environment may result in significant expenses associated with increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of personal information if our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence decreased sales or be exposed to fraud any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and operations in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers to the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm 

cyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations reputation and financial condition 

our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify because of these everevolving risks and regular attacks we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices however the nature of these attacks means that proper policies and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

 23 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could lead to liquidity constraints that may restrict our activities 

we incurred a significant amount of new debt to finance our acquisition of virgin america although we have paid down a large portion of the mergerrelated debt we now carry and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft 

as of december 31 2018  the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737700 800 900 900ers was approximately 81  years the average age of our a319 a320 and a321neo aircraft was approximately 79  years the average age of our e175 aircraft was approximately 14  years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 112  years currently our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results 

in accordance with acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the virgin america acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually we could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties we can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results 

our ability to use virgin america’s net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal and state income tax purposes may be limited if we are unable to earn adequate taxable income in future periods 

our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards nols will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods the nols may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the nols

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests 

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

failure to fully integrate virgin america’s workforce with alaska’s workforce unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel or a significant increase in labor costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

since acquiring virgin america joint collective bargaining agreements or transition agreements have been signed with all unionized workforces except aircraft technicians work will continue in 2019 to fully implement these integration agreements and to reach an agreement with the aircraft technicians failure to reach fully integrated work groups presents the potential for delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs 

should employees engage in job actions such as slowdowns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during section 6 negotiations or transition agreement discussions although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts the operation could be significantly impacted although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert management’s attention from other projects and issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

labor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses in addition to costs associated with represented employee groups labors costs could also increase for nonunionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major us airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market although ample efforts have been dedicated to rightsizing our management structure following the merger with virgin america these increased labor costs may adversely affect our financial performance 

the inability to attract retain and train qualified personnel could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we compete against other major us airlines for pilots aircraft technicians and other skilled labor as more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age the us airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage attrition beyond normal levels the inability to attract new pilots or our key vendors inability to attract and retain mechanics or other skilled labor positions could negatively impact our operating results as a result our business prospects could be harmed additionally we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages or pay increased rates to our vendors to retain these positions this would result in increased overall costs and impacts to our financial position

we are a party to routine litigation matters incidental to our business management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to materially affect our financial position or results of operations this forwardlooking statement is based on management’s current understanding of the relevant law and facts and it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries 

in 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all californiabased virgin america flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of california and city of san francisco wage and hour laws the court 

 26 

certified a class of approximately 1800 flight attendants in november 2016 the company believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit 

in july 2018 the court granted in part plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding virgin america and alaska airlines as a successorininterest to virgin america responsible for various damages and penalties sought by the class members on february 4 2019 the court entered final judgment against virgin america and alaska airlines in the amount of approximately 78 million it did not award behavioral relief from alaska airlines 

the company will then seek an appellate court ruling that the california laws on which the judgment is based are invalid as applied to national airlines pursuant to the us constitution and federal law and for other employment law and improper class certification reasons the company remains confident that a higher court will respect the federal preemption principles that were enacted to shield interstate common carriers from a patchwork of state and local wage and hour regulations such as those at issue in this case and agree with the companys other bases for appeal for these reasons no loss has been accrued

year in review 

december 2018  marked the twoyear anniversary of our acquisition of virgin america as we look back over that time we are very pleased with how far we have come just 24 months ago we were two airlines in complementary geographies with distinct products operating processes and cultures we also had separate faa certificates labor agreements and systems as we stand today virtually all of that has changed our operating processes are fully aligned substantially all of our systems have been merged and all but one of our labor groups are under single collective bargaining agreements through 2018 we have completed about 95 of our major integration milestones and we continue to make great progress on a number of fronts culturally our employees are coming together as one team across the fleet our guest experience is increasingly aligned and we will reach full alignment early in 2020 as we complete the renovation of the airbus fleet we recently began to swap boeing and airbus aircraft onto the most appropriate routes our flight attendants began flying as integrated crews in january 2019 and we are working on the integration of our pilot schedules now 

with much of the integration work behind us we are shifting our focus to realizing the merger synergies and maturing our recent network expansions our core business remains strong and we continue to leverage the financial and operational discipline that has long been a source of our competitive advantage in 2018 we announced or launched a host of new revenue initiatives including increases to bag fees to better align with the industry the introduction of saver fares and the reconfiguration of airbus aircraft we continue to invest heavily in our brand and product through projects like satellite connectivity for our full mainline fleet updating and expanding airport lounges and introducing new food and beverage choices onboard these investments among others are laying the ground work as we look to grow revenues and strengthen margins in 2019 and beyond 

 31 

in 2018  we posted our 15th  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis our pretax income was 585 million  compared to 12 billion  in 2017 our 2018  pretax income on an adjusted basis a nongaap financial measure was 739 million  a decrease  of 42  from 2017  adjusted pretax income for 2018  excludes 87 million  of mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america 45 million  of other onetime special charges and 22 million  of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments 

the decrease in adjusted pretax income was driven largely by an increase in operating expenses excluding fuel and special items of 430 million  and an increase in fuel expense of 489 million  due to significantly higher fuel prices the increased costs were partially offset by an improvement in operating revenues of 370 million  

revenue growth of 370 million  was driven by continued network expansion and aircraft added to our fleet since prior year allowing us to grow capacity about 5  the regional business grew more quickly as we took delivery of 25  new e175 regional jets and grew capacity by 20  as we look to 2019 we are slowing our capacity growth to 2  as we focus on strengthening our performance across the network and expanding margins 

see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure

shareholder return 

in 2018  we paid cash dividends of 158 million  and repurchased 776186  shares of our common stock for 50 million  under the 1 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in august 2015  as of december 31 2018  the company has repurchased approximately 6 million shares for 438 million under this program 

since 2007 we have repurchased 61 million  shares of common stock for 16 billion  for an average price of approximately 2720  per share in 2018  we increased our quarterly dividend 7  from 030  per share to 032  per share and subsequent to december 31 2018  we announced a 9  increase to 035  per share for 2019  overall we returned 208 million  to shareholders during 2018  we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2019  primarily in the form of dividends 

labor update 

in july 2018 alaska dispatchers represented by twu ratified a merger transition agreement and in the third quarter our pilots finalized their integrated seniority list as a result all mainline groups except for aircraft technicians are now under a single collective bargaining agreement and have an integrated seniority list additionally we are currently in negotiations with iam who represent our clerical office and passenger service employees as well as our ramp and stores agents we are optimistic that we will reach a longterm agreement with this work group early in 2019  

other 

in april we entered into an agreement to lease 12 airport slots at laguardia airport lga and eight airport slots at reagan national airport dca to another carrier the lease began in october 2018 and continues through 2028 this agreement enables us to monetize these valuable slots and reallocate flying from dallas love field dal to more strategic and profitable opportunities on the west coast we maintain the right to resume flying using these slots should we choose to do so in 2028 when the agreement expires or if perimeter restrictions change 

on august 10 2018 one of our q400 aircraft was taken without authorization by an employee from seatac international airport the aircraft crashed in a remote area south of the airport resulting in the loss of life of the individual flying the aircraft there were no other fatalities and no ground structures were involved at the crash site the loss of the aircraft is a fully insured event with no deductibles air groups aviation insurance program is secured with a number of highly rated insurers on quota share programs presenting a claim to all insurers on the programs commenced only after the aircraft wreckage was released from governmental authorities in late september 2018 the fbi concluded their investigation in november 2018 we are currently working with insurers to finalize our claim and expect to receive proceeds in the first half of 2019 

outlook 

  

in 2019  and beyond we are focused on completing our integration of boeing and airbus operations and realizing the full synergies from the merger we are investing in our people through an allemployee workshop called flight path so that we can have facetoface conversations between leaders and our employees and come together as one team we know our people are our greatest competitive advantage and that investment along with investments in our product will allow us to continue to be recognized in the industry as one of the best in customer satisfaction 

in 2019  some of the more notable guest experience enhancement projects underway include adding highspeed satellite connectivity to our entire boeing and airbus fleets further upgrades to our onboard menu offerings updating and expanding airport lounges and working with the port of seattle to open a stateoftheart 20gate north satellite concourse at seatac airport we also have begun the retrofit of our airbus fleet which will allow us to align the product across both mainline aircraft platforms 

we have also announced new revenue initiatives that are competitively driven and incremental to our expected merger synergies in fall 2018 we introduced a new option for our guests called the saver fare a lowfare product which we believe will result in incremental annual revenue of approximately 100 million in 2019 in addition we have implemented a series of other revenue initiatives that we expect to add 50 million of revenue in 2019 such as offering exit rows for sale introducing demandbased pricing for our premium class seats leveraging new technology to better manage revenue postsale and eliminating fee waivers for changes made outside of 60 days furthermore we announced an increase in our checked bag fees which is also expected to add approximately 50 million of incremental revenue in 2019 bringing the expected total of new revenue initiatives to 200 million we believe these changes provide guests with more options and reflect the significant increase in the value of our expanded network and product 

 33 

in 2019 we will slow our capacity growth and renew our focus on expanding margins despite cost pressure from wage increases across our unionized labor groups and higher maintenance expenses we will manage costs through productivity initiatives schedule optimization and other initiatives we expect to incur further costs associated with the ongoing integration of virgin america though less than in prior years we also expect the price per gallon of jet fuel to decrease approximately 4  from the prioryear period our casmex will be disproportionately impacted in the first quarter and first half of 2019 due to an increased mix of regional flying timing of heavy maintenance events and costs for allemployee training on a full year basis however we expect to see total unit costs excluding fuel to decrease in the second half of 2019 and expect a full year casmex increase of 2  to 25  

we expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2019  by approximately 2  compared to 53  growth in 2018  current schedules indicate competitive capacity will increase by roughly 4  points in the first quarter of 2019  compared to the first quarter of 2018 we believe that our product our operation our engaged employees our awardwinning service and our competitive mileage plan™ combined with our strong balance sheet give us the ability to compete successfully in the markets we serve

adoption of new accounting standards 

we adopted the new revenue recognition and retirement benefit accounting standards on january 1 2018 utilizing a full retrospective transition method accordingly information for 2017 and 2016 in the following comparative discussions have been recast to reflect the new standards 

2018  compared with 2017   

our consolidated net income for 2018  was 437 million  or 352  per diluted share compared to net income of 960 million  or 775  per diluted share in 2017  

excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments a contract termination fee and onetime bonuses paid to employees as a result of tax reform our adjusted consolidated net income for 2018  was 554 million  or 446  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 791 million  or 638  per share in 2017  the following table reconciles our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share eps during the full year 2018  and 2017  to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

operating statistics summary unaudited 

alaska air group inc 

below are operating statistics we use to measure performance as the acquisition of virgin america closed on december 14 2016 consolidated and mainline amounts presented below include virgin america results for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 in the twelve  months ended december 31 2016 additionally certain historical information has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of new accounting standards we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which are nongaap measures 



 

 36 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   370 million  or 5  during 2018  compared to the same period in 2017  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue 

on a consolidated basis passenger revenue for 2018   increased  by 331 million  or 5  on a 5   increase  in capacity partially offset by a 06 pt  decrease in load factor the capacity increase was driven by the expansion of our network and fleet over the past year although growth was lower than in 2017 as we slowed our expansion to allow for the maturation of a significant number of markets added after our acquisition of virgin america lower load factor is a result of our growth and an increase in competitive capacity in markets we serve in 2018 we began the first of a number of initiatives to combat competitive pressures including increasing our bag fees reconfiguring our airbus cabins and the introduction of our saver fare in the fourth quarter 

mileage plan other revenue 

on a consolidated basis mileage plan other revenue increased   16 million  or 4  as compared to 2017  primarily due to growth in our affinity credit card program resulting in an increase in miles sold to our affinity credit card partner 

cargo and other revenue 

on a consolidated basis cargo and other revenue increased   23 million  or 13  from 2017  the increase is primarily attributable to increased freight and mail capacity from our three freighters and utilizing our airbus fleet to transport cargo the remainder of the increase was due to increased lounge revenue as a result of our new lounges at jfk and seatac airports 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   935 million  or 14  compared to 2017  we consider it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2017  are more fully described below 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below and the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases aircraft fuel expense can be volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease 

 37 

raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense increased   489 million  or 34  compared to 2017  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



raw fuel expense per gallon increased   28  due to higher west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as the refining costs associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2018  was driven by a 32  increase in refining margins and a 28  increase in crude oil prices compared to the prior year fuel gallons consumed increased  by 42 million  or 5  consistent with the increase in capacity of 5  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices have on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

gains recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 24 million  in 2018  compared to losses of 17 million  in 2017  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement 

as of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to decrease approximately 4  in the first quarter of 2019  as compared to the first quarter of 2018  due to decreasing crude oil prices as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2018  by 259 million  or 13  compared to 2017  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   190 million  with a 72  increase in ftes the increase in ftes is attributable to the growth in our business and the growth in mcgee air services which has brought certain airport ground service positions inhouse that were 

 38 

previously reflected in contracted services expense additionally the increase in wages is driven by higher wage rates for many work groups including on average a 24 increase for our mainline pilots and a 10 increase for our mainline flight attendants whose new contract rates became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018  respectively 

costs associated with our defined contribution plans increased   23 million  or 22  due to fte growth increased participation throughout all labor groups and higher contribution rates for mainline pilots and flight attendants as a result of new contract rates effective in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018 respectively 

medical and other benefits expense increased   29 million  or 13  primarily due to fte growth and rising medical costs 

we expect wages and benefits expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 on an approximate 2  3 increase in ftes our guidance does not include the impact of any future agreements we may reach with aircraft technicians or the iam labor group 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  to 147 million  in 2018  from 135 million  in 2017 due to a higher wage base upon which achievement percentage is applied as compared to the prior year as well as a higher number of months where we achieved our monthly opr goals 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased  by 44 million  or 11  compared to 2017  maintenance costs increased  primarily due to a powerbythehour engine maintenance arrangement on our b737800 aircraft which was entered into and became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017 although the agreement results in increased expense earlier in the engine life cycle of b737800 aircraft it allows for much more predictable expense patterns over the fleet life the remaining increase was due to higher volumes of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events as compared to the prior period 

we expect aircraft maintenance expense to increase 2  4 in 2019  due to increased volume of maintenance checks and airframe and engine component costs in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to our larger fleet we expect these costs to be higher in the first half of 2019 and then to decline as we proceed through the year 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense increased   41 million  or 15  compared to 2017  primarily due to the the addition of four  a321neos to our mainline fleet and nine  e175s added to our cpa agreement with skywest in 2018 

we expect aircraft rent to increase in 2019  at a greater rate than our forecasted capacity growth due to the full year impact of these aircraft as well as two additional a321neo deliveries in 2019 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased   39 million  or 8  compared to 2017  primarily driven by our 5  increase in capacity and rate increases at many of our hub airports 

we expect landing fees and other rental expense to grow 7 to 10 in 2019  as we continue to add capacity to our network we also expect to see rate increases at many airports we serve specifically our hubs as significant capital programs are undertaken 

selling expenses 

selling expenses decreased  by 42 million  or 11  compared to 2017  this decrease was primarily due to lower credit card commissions and decreased promotional and advertising activities notably those related to virgin america 

we expect selling expense to decrease  in 2019  due primarily to a continued improvement in our credit card rates decreased spending on advertising and distribution as well as aggressive targets set to reduce our vendor costs 

 39 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 26 million  or 7  compared to 2017  primarily due to the addition of eight  owned b737900ers and 16  owned e175s to our fleet since december 31 2017  as well as the acceleration of depreciation taken on certain of our q400 aircraft 

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase 9  13 in 2019  primarily due to the full year impact of depreciation of our e175 aircraft delivered in 2018 and additional deliveries in 2019 as well as accelerated depreciation on our q400 fleet as we begin to retire a portion of this fleet 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expense increased  by 16 million  or 8  compared to 2017  due to the increased number of passengers premium class offerings and enhancements to our onboard menu offerings to provide higher quality food and beverage products 

we expect food and beverage expenses to remain flat in 2019  compared to 2018  primarily due to our increasing focus on reducing waste and changes to our catering process for our regional business 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements increased   33 million  or 27  in 2018  compared to 2017  the increase is primarily due to the addition of nine  e175 aircraft operated by skywest in the current year 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to continue to increase in 2019  as we realize the fullyear impact of the additional e175 aircraft operated by skywest 

special items  mergerrelated costs 

we recorded 87 million  of mergerrelated costs in 2018  associated with our ongoing integration of virgin america operations compared to 116 million  in 2017  costs incurred in 2018  consisted primarily of severance and retention costs it integration costs and the writeoff of virgin america related assets connected with our transition to a single pss in april 2018 we expect to continue to incur mergerrelated costs in 2019 

special items  other 

we recorded other special items of 45 million  in 2018 these consisted of a onetime settlement fee of 20 million  for the termination of a former maintenance services agreement which was subsequently replaced by a new agreement that provides more flexibility for the timing and scope of aircraft engine maintenance the remaining 25 million  was due to onetime bonuses paid to employees as a result of tax reform in early 2018 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2018  we recorded nonoperating expense of 58 million  compared to nonoperating expense of 49 million  in 2017  the increase is primarily due to certain disposal costs associated with nonoperating crj700 aircraft 

additional segment information 

refer to note 13  of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

mainline adjusted pretax profit was 809 million  in 2018  compared to 12 billion  in 2017  the 435 million  decrease in pretax profit was primarily driven by a 306 million  increase in mainline nonfuel operating expenses and a 370 million  increase in mainline fuel expense these increases were partially offset by a 231 million  increase in mainline operating revenue 

 40 

nonfuel operating expense increased due to higher wages related to new contract wage rates for pilots and flight attendants and higher other operating expense categories as described above higher raw fuel prices and an increase in gallons consumed drove the increase in mainline fuel expense mainline revenue increased primarily due to increased revenue passengers on lower average fares

our regional operations incurred a pretax loss of 100 million  in 2018  compared to a pretax profit of 34 million  in 2017  the pretax loss was primarily attributable to 172 million  higher nonfuel operating expense and 90 million  increase in fuel costs partially offset by a 139 million increase in operating revenues the increase in nonfuel operating expenses is primarily due to higher ownership costs associated with nine  e175 aircraft operated by skywest that were added to the regional fleet over the past year as well as higher cpa rates on a 20  increase in capacity 

horizon 

horizon achieved a pretax profit of 27 million  in 2018  compared to pretax loss of 8 million  in 2017  the change was primarily driven by a significantly improved operation in 2018 as compared to 2017 a 17 million decrease in aircraft maintenance expense due to a lower volume of scheduled maintenance events as compared to the prior period and a 11  increase growth in capacity attributable to 16  e175 aircraft added to horizons fleet over the past year

2017  compared with 2016 

our consolidated net income for 2017  was 960 million  or 775  per diluted share compared to net income of 797 million  or 641  per diluted share in 2016  our financial results include results of virgin america for the period from december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of december 14 2016 refer to our previously filed forms 10k for 2016 and 2017 for additional information on accounting for our merger with virgin america 

excluding the impact of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and special items our adjusted consolidated net income for 2017  was 791 million  or 638  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 894 million  or 719  per share in 2016  the following tables reconcile our adjusted net income and eps during the full year 2017 and 2016 to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

combined comparative operating statistics 

given the december 2016 acquisition of virgin america we believe that analysis of specific financial and operational results on a combined basis provides more meaningful yearoveryear comparisons the discussion below includes “combined comparative” results for 2016 determined as the sum of the historical consolidated results of air group and virgin america additionally we adopted the new revenue recognition and retirement benefit accounting standards on january 1 2018 utilizing a full retrospective transition method preacquisition virgin america 2016 results have not been retrospectively adjusted for these accounting standards nor has it been conformed to reflect air groups historical financial statement presentation the combined comparative information does not purport to reflect what our financial and operational results would have been had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented 

 42 



a 2016 combined operating statistics have been recalculated using the combined results 

 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   20 billion  or 33  during 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  on a combined comparative basis total operating revenues increased 405 million  or 5  the changes including the reconciliation of the impact of virgin america on the comparative results are summarized in the following table 



a b c see footnotes on the combined comparative operating statistics table above 

passenger revenue 

on a consolidated basis passenger revenue for 2017   increased  by 19 billion  or 35  on a 41  increase in capacity driven by the acquisition of virgin america offset by a 37  decline in yield on a combined comparative basis passenger revenue increased by 495 million  or 7  due to a 7  increase in capacity the increase in capacity was driven by our continued network expansion and growth in the number of operating aircraft in 2017 we launched 44 new markets to activate our new larger network lower ticket yields pricing were impacted in large part by our new market growth and by competitor pricing actions felt more acutely in our california markets 

mileage plan other revenue 

mileage plan other revenue increased  by 48 million  or 13  compared to 2016  primarily due to increases in miles sold to our affinity card partner during the year and mileage plan™ revenue earned from partner airlines 

  

 43 

cargo and other 

cargo and other revenue increased   12 million  or 7  from 2016  due to increased lounge revenues and freight services on a combined comparative basis cargo and other revenue decreased 138 million  or 441  this decrease is primarily due to not reflecting the impact of the new revenue accounting standard on 2016 preacquisition virgin america totals had the standard been applied the majority of virgin americas other revenue would have been moved to passenger or mileage plan other revenue 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   21 billion  or 45  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis total operating expenses increased 725 million  or 12  primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and higher fuel costs among other increases we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 

a b c see footnotes on the combined comparative operating statistics table above 

significant operating expense variances from 2016  are more fully described below 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense increased   616 million  or 74  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis aircraft fuel expense increased 323 million   or 29  the elements of the change are summarized in the following table 



on a combined comparative basis raw fuel expense per gallon increased 21 due primarily to higher west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2017 was driven by a 38 increase in refining margins and a 17 increase in crude oil prices compared to the prior year fuel gallons consumed increased by 58 million or 8 consistent with the increase in capacity of 7 on a combined comparative basis 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 17 million  in 2017  compared to losses of 16 million  in 2016  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement

nonfuel expense and nonspecial items 

the table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of virgin america on the comparative results for each of our operating expense line items excluding fuel and special items 



a b c see footnotes on the combined comparative operating statistics table above 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2017  by 537 million  or 39  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis total wages and benefits increased by 253 million  or 15  the primary components of wages and benefits including a reconciliation of 2016 on a combined comparative basis are shown in the following table 



a b c see footnotes on the combined comparative operating statistics table above 

on a combined comparative basis wages increased   222 million  with a 16  increase in ftes the increase in ftes is attributable to the growth in our business and the growth in mcgee air services which has brought certain airport ground service positions inhouse that were previously reflected in contracted services expense additionally wage rates for pilots at alaska and virgin america increased significantly in november 2017 as a result of new contract rates stemming from a decision reached by a thirdparty arbitration panel during the fourth quarter of 2017  

costs associated with our defined contribution plans increased   14 million  or 16  on a combined comparative basis due to fte growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups additionally due to the arbitration decision reached in the fourth quarter of 2017 pilots at alaska and virgin america began receiving contributions at a higher rate 

 45 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased to 135 million  in 2017  from 127 million  in 2016  on a combined comparative basis variable incentive pay decreased 24 million or 15 due to lower achievement against performancebased pay metrics as compared to the prior year 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased  by 121 million  or 45  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis aircraft maintenance costs increased 41 million  or 12  maintenance costs increased primarily due to timing of scheduled maintenance events in 2017 as well as a powerbythehour maintenance agreement for our b737800 aricraft that began during the fourth quarter of 2017 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense increased   160 million  or 140  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis aircraft rent expense decreased   10 million  or 4  primarily due to the resetting of straightline aircraft rent resulting from purchase price accounting for leases held by virgin america 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased   140 million  or 44  compared to 2016 on a combined comparative basis landing fees and other rental expenses increased 33 million or 8 primarily due to increased flying in 2017  as we increased capacity by 7 and entered into 44 new markets 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   67 million  or 27  when compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis contracted services increased   7 million  or 2  primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us additionally wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve these cost increases were partially offset by insourcing some of the ground services at many airports to mcgee air services whose costs are now included in other financial statement line items particularly wages and benefits 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased by 120 million  or 48  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis selling expenses decreased   3 million  or 1  the 2016 preacquisition virgin america balances were not adjusted to reflect the new revenue recognition standard had the standard been applied virgin americas selling expenses would have decreased in 2016 resulting in a combined comparative year over year increase in selling expenses mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 9 million  or 2  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis depreciation and amortization expense decreased   28 million  or 7  primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain b737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years which was effective october 1 2016 partially offset by the addition of 14 b737900ers and 10 e175s to our fleet during 2017 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased by 69 million  or 55  compared to 2016 on a combined comparative basis food and beverage service expenses increased   20 million  or 11  due to the increased number of passengers premium class offerings and enhancements to our onboard menu offerings to provide higher quality food and beverage products 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpas increased   26 million  or 27  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase was primarily due to the addition of eight e175 aircraft operated by skywest in 2017 

 46 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   195 million  or 53  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis other operating expenses increased   109 million  or 24  primarily due to higher costs associated with crew costs such as hotels and per diems training higher it costs an increase in scrapped parts inventory and higher property taxes 

special items—mergerrelated costs 

we recorded special items of 116 million  for mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america in 2017  compared to 117 million  in 2016  which reflects the results of virgin america from december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and 138 million on a combined comparative basis in 2016  costs incurred in 2017  consisted primarily of severance and retention costs and it integration costs 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2017  we recorded nonoperating expense of 49 million  compared to nonoperating income of 10 million  in 2016  on a combined comparative basis nonoperating expense increased  by 40 million  primarily due to interest expense incurred in 2017 on the debt issued in 2016 to finance the acquisition of virgin america 

additional segment information 

refer to note 13  of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

mainline adjusted pretax profit was 12 billion  in 2017 compared to 13 billion  in 2016 on a combined comparative basis mainline adjusted pretax profit decreased by 267 million  the table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of virgin america on the comparative results for our mainline segment excluding mergerrelated costs and marktomarket fuelhedge accounting charges 



a b c see footnotes on the combined comparative operating statistics table above 

the 267 million  decrease in combined comparative pretax profit was driven by a 270 million  increase in mainline fuel expense a 324 million  increase in mainline nonfuel operating expenses and a 33 million  increase in nonoperating expense these increases were partially offset by a 360 million  increase in mainline passenger revenue higher raw fuel prices and an increase in gallons consumed to support additional flying drove the increase in mainline fuel expense nonfuel operating expenses increased due to higher wages to support our growth and higher operating expenses as described above nonoperating expense increased primarily due to increased interest expense mainline revenue increased due to higher capacity from new routes 

regional 

our regional operations contributed a pretax profit of 34 million  in 2017  compared to 124 million  in 2016  the 90 million  decrease in pretax profit was driven by an 83 million  higher nonfuel operating expense due in large part to increased capacity and higher raw fuel costs partially offset by a 40 million  increase in revenue 

 47 

horizon 

horizon incurred a pretax loss of 8 million  in 2017  compared to pretax profit of 10 million  in 2016  the change was primarily driven by 20 million  higher nonfuel operating expenses nonfuel expenses increased primarily due to higher wage and training expense as a result of the increase in ftes increased costs associated with flight cancellations and a 9 million ratification bonus expense in connection with the agreement reached with horizons pilots 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

in 2018  we took delivery of eight  owned b737900er and 16  owned e175 aircraft made debt payments totaling 807 million  and secured 339 million  of new borrowings we also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling 158 million  and repurchasing 50 million  of our common stock because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance we are one of only three airlines in the us with investment grade credit ratings 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



   

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 12 billion  in 2018  compared to 16 billion  in 2017  the decrease of 395 million  is primarily due to a decrease in our net income for reasons previously discussed 

 48 

in 2017  we generated 16 billion  in operating cash flows compared to 14 billion  in 2016  the increase of 204 million was due to an increase in our net income 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment to make debt payments and to return capital to shareholders during 2016 we paused our share repurchase program as we prepared for the acquisition of virgin america we resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017  and continued the program in 2018  

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 631 million  during 2018  compared to 11 billion  in 2017  our capital expenditures were 960 million  or 66 million   lower  than 2017  primarily due to the deferral of mainline deliveries in 2018 offset by an increase in nonaircraft spend related to the retrofit of our fleet and corporate real estate projects cash used in investing activities was also impacted by net sales of marketable securities of 282 million in 2018 compared to net purchases in 2017 of 181 million the shift to net sales is primarily due to funds being utilized to prepay certain debt for further information regarding our future expected capital expenditures please refer to the contractual obligations and commitments section below 

cash used in investing activities was 11 billion  during 2017  compared to 26 billion  in 2016  in 2016 we used 2 billion to acquire virgin america representing 26 billion  consideration paid offset by 645 million  of cash acquired this cash outlay was offset by increased capital expenditures in 2017 which were 1 billion  in 2017  348 million higher than in 2016 and was a result of the purchase of more aircraft in 2017 

cash used in financing activities 

  

cash used in financing activities was 647 million  during 2018  compared to cash used in financing activities of 592 million  in 2017  during the year we made debt payments of 807 million  repurchased 50 million  of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 158 million  during the fourth quarter of 2018 we secured new debt financing from multiple lenders of 339 million  which replaced certain debt previously retired 

in 2017  we made debt payments of 397 million  repurchased 75 million  of our common stock and made cash dividend payments of 148 million  in 2016  we secured debt proceeds of 2 billion for the acquisition of virgin america made debt payments of 249 million  repurchased 193 million  of our common stock and made cash dividend payments of 136 million  

  

we plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand internally generated cash from operations along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lines of credit 

  

we have three  credit facilities with availability totaling 516 million  including one 250 million  credit facility one 150 million  credit facility and one 116 million  credit facility we have secured letters of credit against the 116 million  facility but have no plans to borrow using either of the two  remaining facilities 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase and lease commitments 

  

as of december 31 2018  we have firm orders to purchase or lease 48  aircraft we also have cancelable purchase commitments for 30  airbus a320neo aircraft with deliveries from 2022  through 2024  we could incur a loss of predelivery payments and credits as a cancellation fee we also have options to acquire up to 37  additional b737 aircraft with deliveries from 2021  through 2024  and 30  e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2021  to 2023  in addition to the 32   e175 aircraft currently operated by skywest in our regional fleet we have options in future periods to add regional capacity by having skywest operate up to eight  more e175 aircraft 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 750 million  in both 2019  and 2020  we currently expect delivery of seven  owned mainline jet aircraft and four  owned regional jet aircraft in 2019  

 49 

the following table summarizes our expected fleet count by year as of february 15 2019  



 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through cash from operations longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 



 50 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our obligations as of december 31 2018  for agreements with variable terms amounts included reflect our minimum obligations 



 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 367 million  at december 31 2018  compared to a 304 million  unfunded position at december 31 2017  this results in an 84  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 87  funded as of december 31 2017  there were no contributions in 2018  to the plans 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the shortterm are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices usage of net operating losses whether bonus depreciation provisions are available any future tax reform efforts at the federal level as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2018  we had no net tax payments and had an effective tax rate of 253  we believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

 51 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

frequent flyer programs 

  

alaskas mileage plan™ loyalty program awards mileage credits to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners referred to as flown miles we also sell services including miles for transportation companion fare™ certificates bag fee waivers and access to our brand and customer lists to a major bank that offers alaska affinity credit cards to a lesser extent miles for transportation are also sold to other nonairline partners such as hotels and car rental agencies the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners and for nonairline products such as hotels as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

  

mileage credits and the various other services we sell under our loyalty program represent performance obligations that are part of a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement accounting guidance requires that we use a relative standalone selling price allocation to allocate consideration received to the material performance obligations in these contracts our relative standalone selling price allocation models are refreshed when contracts originate or are materially modified 

  

at december 31 2018  we had approximately 243 billion  miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate deferred revenue balance of 19 billion  the deferred revenue resulting from our relative selling price allocations requires significant management judgment there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or expenses the most significant assumptions are described below 

  

   

we estimate the standalone selling price for each performance obligation including mileage credits by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimate the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem mileage credits for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program™ and historical award redemption patterns 

we regularly review significant mileage plan™ assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

 52 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil component of jet fuel limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2018  would change the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 8 million  or 2 million  respectively 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 4 million  at december 31 2018  compared to a portfolio value of 22 million  at december 31 2017  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2018  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 4  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have a number of interest rate swaps that fix the interest rates on certain variablerate debt agreements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on average variablerate debt held during 2018  would have correspondingly changed our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 5 million  our variablerate debt represents approximately 70  and 63  of our total longterm debt as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively 

our exposure to interest rate variability is further mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average one point more than they did in 2018  interest income would increase by approximately 14 million

our mission is creating an airline people love the ing is to recognize that we are never done we are continually working to improve we believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively it is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance but people the communities we serve and environment 

in 2017 we focused much of our energy on integrating virgin america we achieved several milestones including merging most back office functions kicking off station colocations and launching technology that enables our frontline employees to be agile between alaska and virgin america applications in january 2018 alaska and virgin america obtained a single operating certificate from the federal aviation administration faa our most significant integration milestone to date these accomplishments will ease our transition to a single passenger service system pss in the spring of 2018 which will help us unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition we remain on track to complete all of our integration milestones on schedule and continue to be optimistic about the value of our combined company 

with the integration well underway we remain committed to our strategic focus to become the goto airline for people on the west coast the acquisition of virgin america positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the us with an unparalleled ability to serve west coast travelers to do so we believe we need to meet our guests evolving needs through innovation in our onboard offerings and provide unique destinations with better schedules while retaining the best of both the alaska and virgin america brand experiences we have begun to implement this strategy in a number of ways including merging our loyalty programs allowing us to bring the award winning benefits of our mileage plan™ program to virgin americas loyal customer base rolling out free movies and free chat to virgin americas entire fleet and kicking off the first of several cabin enhancements of alaskas boeing aircraft with expressive mood lighting 

while aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation we recognize this is fundamentally a people business our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with guests and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute our strategy in 2017  alaska was once again named one of americas best employers by forbes magazine for the third year in a row we know that engaged employees provide excellent service in that vein in 2017  alaska ranked highest in jd power and associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the tenth  year in a row virgin america was also recognized for excellent service by conde nast traveler and travel  leisure magazine also for the tenth year in a row customer service matters and we believe the combination of alaska and virgin america will only enhance the experience for our guests 

operationally alaska held the no 1 spot in the wall street journals middle seat scorecard for us airlines for four consecutive years and the no 2 spot for 2017 although we were not the leader in ontime performance in 2017 we led the industry for ontime performance among major airlines for the previous seven years we are focused on becoming the industry leader in operational performance once again as we fully integrate alaska and virgin america operations and we are off to a great start in 2018 for achieving safety customer service operational and financial goals we rewarded our employees with 135 million  for their service in 2017  

in support of the communities that we serve we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship our combined fleet is one of the youngest most fuelefficient fleets in north america and we look forward to further enhancements in this area as a result of our environmental and corporate sustainability leadership we ranked higher than any other north american airline in this years dow jones sustainability index we are also proud of our community stewardship  air group donated 14 million  to over 1300 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 32000  hours of community service focused on youth and education medical research and transportation and community outreach in 2017

one of our leadership principles is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees across the system 

we continued to generate strong profits in 2017  marking our 14th  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis our liquidity and capital position remain strong positioning us among those of highquality industrial companies due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three us airlines with investment grade credit ratings with the cash generated by our continued success we have been able to invest in our business to achieve profitable growth and to enhance the guest experience 

as we look to the future we will build on our success by executing our strategic plan in the following areas 

be safe and on time 

we have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives alaska and horizon were the first us major airlines to receive faa validation and acceptance of our safety management system sms in 2016 in 2017 virgin america adopted sms ensuring a consistent safety process across our carriers additionally all virgin america employees received training for the alaska air group sms our ready safe go principles and our mobile safety reporting system once again in 2017 100 of our alaska and horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the faas diamond certificate of excellence award this is the 16th consecutive year alaska airlines has received the award and the 16th time in the last 18 years horizon has received this award we also believe that maintaining safe operations through adherence to welldefined processes and ensuring every air group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance the rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in north america for ontime performance 

focus on people 

our business is fundamentally a people business and our success depends on our nearly 23000  employees engaged employees deliver higher productivity superior execution and better customer service in merging alaska airlines and virgin america employees and labor groups we kept a vigilant focus on creating an unbeatable culture in january 2017 we rolled out momentum training for all virgin america employees to help bridge the two airlines and blend our cultures we implemented culture champion initiatives to help employees build relationships across airlines allowing them to share concerns and feedback directly with executive leadership similarly our qx factor program brought new energy to the horizon employee experience our people programs and integration plan are focused on ensuring employees feel valued informed and engaged in meaningful ways as we build our future 

aligning our employees goals with air groups goals is important in achieving success all permanent employees of our airlines participate in our performancebased pay pbp and operational performance rewards opr programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety profitability ontime performance low costs customer loyalty and customer satisfaction over the last five years our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one months pay for most employees 

build a deep emotional connection for our brand 

to be the goto airline for people on the west coast we must be recognized for creating an airline that people love in 2017 we built upon the strong brand connection we have with our guests in our pacific northwest markets and the state of alaska by broadening our focus to include california we rolled out fresh modern marketing campaigns showcasing benefits such as our network growth low fares our buy one get one companion fare credit card promotional offer and unique onboard experience elements we are enthusiastic about our plans for continued investment in key products that will provide meaningful improvements to our guests such as gogo satellite internet which we will begin installing in early 2018 additionally we partnered with key sponsors in the bay area including sports franchises such as the san francisco giants and the san jose sharks as well as noted professional athletes including kevin durant of the golden state warriors 

we continue to invest in key products that will provide meaningful improvements to our guests and further drive an emotional connection to our brand this includes free chat and free movies and the launch of gogo satellite service already mentioned above we’ve rolled out new digital products to improve the guest experience including a new inflight entertainment portal and the beta launch of first class meal preselect we’ve nearly completed retrofits of our boeing fleet to include premium class while adding larger overhead bins to many of our aircraft expanding our airport lounge portfolio we’ve opened a third lounge at seatac airport and plan to open a lounge at jfk in 2018 finally guests can also look forward to an integrated onboard food and beverage program in 2018 which will emphasize fresh and local west coast products on our aircraft

defend and grow our customer base 

competition in our markets is fierce and we know we must defend our customer base as we grow our network presence by providing our guests with an increased choice of schedule times and fares and allowing us to effectively compete for new guests we will continue to introduce guests to our awardwinning service mileage plan™ program and visa signature credit card as we grow our network we work hard to ensure our guests have a great experience on our airlines and provide an exceptional product at a low fare 

win with low costs and low fares 

we believe that our lowfare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing value to and building trust with our guests we also know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while returning value to our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure in 2017  our unit costs excluding fuel and special items remained flat year over year on a consolidated basis we understand the importance of low costs to the business model and the success of the company and we have a long track record of reducing unit costs although our unit costs are expected to rise in 2018 primarily due to pilot wages and maintenance costs we continue to focus on productivity cost management low overhead and leveraging capacity growth we also manage increasing fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 35  over the last five years as we continue to integrate virgin america into our operations we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals it is critical that we achieve these goals in order to continue our cost reduction efforts 

during fiscal 2017  we added 44  new markets to the combined network for 2018  we plan to grow our systemwide capacity approximately 75  as compared to 2017  approximately 70 of growth in 2018 is attributable to existing routes and locations with the rest attributable to our plans to fly 13  daily departures from paine fieldsnohomish county airport in everett washington to eight  west coast markets starting in fall 2018 

air group 

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of alaska virgin america horizon mcgee air services a whollyowned subsidiary of alaska and other business units alaska virgin america and horizon operate as airlines however the business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially for horizon in comparison to alaska and virgin america mcgee air services operates as an aviation services provider focused on providing ground and ramp handling services to airlines alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 virgin america is a delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2004 and acquired by air group on december 14 2016  horizon is a washington corporation that began service and was incorporated in 1981 it was acquired by air group in 1986 mcgee air services is a delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2016 alaska and virgin america operate fleets of narrowbody passenger jets together the operations of alaska and virgin america are referred to as mainline operations alaska also contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity such that alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon began operating e175 regional jet aircraft in 2017 in addition to its fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement cpa the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers the percentage of revenues by category is as follows 



 

we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in ways that best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce our seasonality

the percentage of our capacity by region is as follows 



 

mainline 

our mainline operations include boeing 737 b737 and airbus family a319 a320 and a321neo jet service offered by alaska and virgin america we offer extensive passenger service from the western us throughout the contiguous united states alaska hawaii canada mexico and costa rica our largest concentration of departures are in seattle portland and the bay area we also offer cargo service throughout our network and have dedicated cargo aircraft that operate primarily to and within the state of alaska 

  

in 2017  we carried 35 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations at december 31 2017  our mainline operating fleet consisted of 154  b737 jet aircraft and 67  airbus a320 family jet aircraft compared to 155  b737 aircraft and 63  airbus aircraft as of december 31 2016  

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



 

regional 

  

our regional operations consist of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2017  our regional operations carried approximately 9 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and carries approximately 74  of air groups regional revenue passengers 

based on 2017  horizon passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our most significant concentration of regional activity was in seattle and portland at december 31 2017  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 10  embraer 175 e175 jet aircraft and 50  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft the regional fleet operated by skywest consisted of 23  e175 aircraft

the percentage of regional passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



frequent flyer program 

in 2017 we maintained two frequent flyer plans the alaska airlines mileage plan™ and virgin america elevate® to provide consistency and clarity to our guests we merged the two programs throughout the year and elevate® was officially sunset in december 2017 

alaska airlines mileage plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 18  airline partners by using the alaska airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program through alaska and our global partners mileage plan™ members have access to a large network of over 900  worldwide travel destinations further members can receive 30000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on alaska airlines and virgin america purchases alaska airlines visa signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the us and platinum and world elite mastercard holders in canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling in the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or partner airlines or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines we believe all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value for their travel 

mileage plan™ and elevate® revenues represented approximately 11  of air groups total revenues in 2017  mileage plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements frequent flyer agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our mileage plan™ members alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our mileage plan™ members through frequent flyer partnerships with 18  domestic and international carriers 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests 

alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

 8 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time 

the comprehensive summary of alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows 



 

 9 

the following is the financial impact of our marketing alliances 



 

other revenue 

other revenue consists of freight and mail certain frequent flyer and ancillary revenue while some of our product features are included in our base pricing we have unbundled certain ancillary features that our guests separately value major ancillary revenue products include checked bag fees change fees and lounge memberships we also promote and sell products inflight to enhance the guest experience including our tom douglas signature meals snacks alcoholic beverages inflight entertainment and wifi total other revenue excluding frequent flyer program revenue represents about 7  of our total revenues 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2017  the airline industrys profits declined when compared to the record setting year of 2016 primarily due to rising fuel prices higher labor costs and increased competitive fare actions reducing ticket prices despite some of these headwinds the industry continued to report strong profits in 2017 in the current strong industry environment airlines are making significant investments in airports in more fuelefficient planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering thus the level of competition is expected to continue to increase 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18  to 34  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the us 

  

the prices we have paid for crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of 43  per barrel in 2016 to a high of 98  in 2013 for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 19 million  of fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 8 million  per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years average annual west coast refining margin prices have fluctuated between 13  per barrel and 36  per barrel in the last five years and averaged 18  per barrel in 2017  

 10 

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased   21  in 2017  after decreasing 19 in 2016  and 39 in 2015  

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



 

we use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet virgin america operates an allairbus a320 family fleet and horizon currently operates a fleet including embraer 175 jet aircraft and bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft air groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 753  asmsg in 2013  to 779  asmsg in 2017  these improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta who has significantly increased its capacity in seattle over the past few years approximately 75 of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta as we grow in california and expand our transcontinental route offerings united airlines and southwest airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve our california and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the pacific northwest based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 6  in the first half of 2018  weighted based on our network 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests 

  

 

safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do in 2017 we were ranked by airlineratingscom as one of only two us airlines in the top 20 safest airlines in the world we also received our 16th diamond award of excellence from the federal aviation administration recognizing both alaska and horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training 

  

 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance guest amenities—including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2017  alaska airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by jd power and associates for the tenth  year in a row we have installed boeing space bins on the majority of our boeing 737900er fleet providing additional overhead bin space for our guests in 2017 we launched a premium class of service on our b737 aircraft that provides extra 

 11 

legroom early boarding premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage additionally in 2017 we increased the distance between seats in our first class cabins on the alaska b737900 and b737900er fleet providing significantly more space for guests flying in the first class cabin we expect to fully complete the first class cabin upgrades on the b737900 and b737900er fleet in early 2018 

starting in 2018 we will begin reconfiguring the interior and livery of the airbus fleet the new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests a consistent brand experience across the mainline fleet the projects are expected to be complete in late 2019 

our employees are a key element of our product we have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a high degree of service and hospitality to our guests both at the airport and in flight we heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys 

  

 

fare pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing over 80 of total seats accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields we will defend our core markets and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe the restructuring weve completed over the past decade has decreased our costs enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders 

 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles the mileage plan™ offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 18  partner carriers 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets to some extent our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   



 12 

that is charged to the airline many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs 

  

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



 

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have significantly improved the seasonality of our operations by our continued growth from the west coast to leisure destinations like hawaii and costa rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• changes in fuel costs 

 

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems we also are susceptible to air traffic control due to our heavy concentration of departures from seattle and san francisco 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2017  we employed 23156   13896  at alaska 3538  at virgin america 3943  at horizon and 1779  at mcgee air services active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 39  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2017  and 40  in 2016  

most major airlines including alaska virgin america and horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements cba airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand 

 13 

as part of the integration we have been working to bring represented alaska airlines and virgin america work groups under single collective bargaining agreements the process for combining workgroups begins with the union filing a petition with the national mediation board nmb at which point the nmb performs a review to assess a ‘single carrier determination’ for the airlines following this single carrier determination the nmb makes a representation determination depending on size of the premerger bargaining units and will either extend the certification if one is significantly larger than the other or require a vote once representation is determined the nmb certifies the union as the bargaining representative for the work group the parties must also work together to achieve agreed upon single collective bargaining agreements integration also requires the premerger work groups to agree upon and finalize integrated seniority lists as of december 31 2017 we have labor integration agreements with pilots and clerical office and passenger services employees meaning all agreements are completed to define how and when we will combine the alaska and virgin america groups into one the remaining work groups are still in process of completing similar such agreements the time frame to reach single cba and full transition to work rules for each group will vary 

at december 31 2017  labor unions represented 84  of alaska’s 84  of virgin americas 44  of horizon’s and 90  of mcgee air services employees 

our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under the rla collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 17 

 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

in the future there may be legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

 18 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our company by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such event substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives this would harm our business 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

factors that might impact our operations include 

 

 

 

   

 

   

 

 

 20 

 

due to our concentration of flights along the west coast and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to air traffic control delays additionally due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels these initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates they could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative 

 21 

public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

integration of virgin america 

we may be unable to effectively integrate virgin america’s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

we must devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of virgin america potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 

 

 

 

any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis or at all these factors could also reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results in addition integration requirements have caused and may continue to cause a delay of other strategic initiatives 

the need to integrate virgin america’s workforce into collective bargaining agreements with alaskas workforce presents the potential for delay in achieving expected synergies and other benefits or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs 

the successful integration of virgin america and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition depend significantly on integrating virgin america’s employees into alaska and on maintaining productive employee relations failure to do so presents the potential for delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs the process for integrating labor groups in an airline merger is governed by a combination of the railway labor act the mccaskillbond act and where applicable the existing provisions of our cbas in addition to internal union policies 

as part of the transition agreement with the pilot workgroup there is a temporary “fence” between alaska and virgin america pilots requiring that only alaska pilots operate boeing aircraft and only virgin america pilots operate airbus aircraft through the implementation of the recent joint collective bargaining agreement that now applies to all pilots from both airlines this fence will be removed when the two groups are combined into a single scheduling system later in 2018   in addition flight attendants dispatchers and mechanics cannot be fully integrated until transition agreements have been reached and single seniority lists have been provided to the company by each workgroup achievement of expected synergies and other benefits will be delayed until the time that operational integration is obtained 

we will need to launch certain branding or rebranding initiatives in connection with the integration that may take a significant amount of time and involve substantial costs and that may not be favorably received by our guests 

we may incur substantial costs as a result of rebranding virgin america’s products and services including updating the aircraft livery and configuration and may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by virgin america in any of virgin america’s markets the failure of any such rebranding initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain guests which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits contemplated to result from the acquisition 

 22 

we are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of virgin america 

we are expected to continue to incur substantial integration and transition expenses in connection with the acquisition of virgin america including the necessary costs associated with integrating the operations of alaska and virgin america there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including ticketingdistribution maintenance and flight operations while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the financial benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition including the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses likely will continue to result in us taking charges against earnings in future periods and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results 

in accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the virgin america acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually we could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties we can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results 

we obtain our rights to use the virgin brand under agreements with certain entities affiliated with the virgin group and we would lose those rights if these agreements are terminated or not renewed 

virgin america is a party to license agreements with certain entities affiliated with the virgin group pursuant to which we obtain rights to use the virgin brand the licensor may terminate the agreements upon the occurrence of a number of specified events including if virgin america commits a material breach of its obligations under the agreements that is uncured for more than 10 business days or if it materially damages the virgin brand if we lose our rights to use the virgin brand our current plan to discontinue use of the virgin america trademarks gradually would need to be accelerated which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

the virgin brand is not under our control and negative publicity related to the virgin brand name could materially adversely affect our business 

virgin america licenses rights to the virgin brand from certain entities affiliated with the virgin group on a nonexclusive basis the virgin brand is also licensed to and used by a number of other companies including two airlines virgin atlantic airways and virgin australia airlines operating in other geographies we rely on the general goodwill of consumers and our employees towards the virgin brand consequently any adverse publicity in relation to the virgin brand name its principals particularly sir richard branson who is closely associated with the brand or another virginbranded company over which we have no control or influence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key west coast markets the resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

 23 

we continue to strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive costreduction goals this is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations 

  

our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the west coast this results in a high concentration of our business in key west coast markets a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle portland and bay area hubs in 2017  passengers to and from seattle portland and the bay area accounted for 81  of our total guests 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts virgin america is similarly dependent on airbus and horizon is dependent on bombardier and embraer additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type as a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers this could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska or virgin america codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

 24 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs we also plan to move our primary data center location disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs 

we accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could lead to liquidity constraints that may restrict our activities 

we incurred a significant amount of new debt to finance our acquisition of virgin america we now have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

 25 

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft 

as of december 31 2017  the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737800 900 900ers was approximately 75  years the average age of our a319 a320 and a321neo aircraft was approximately 73  years the average age of our embraer e175 aircraft was approximately 12  years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 11  years our relatively new aircraft require less maintenance currently than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our ability to use virgin america’s net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal and state income tax purposes may be limited if we are unable to earn adequate taxable income in future periods 

our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards nols will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods the nols may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the nols 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests 

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs 

in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses each of alaska horizon virgin america and mcgee air services represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement in relation to the virgin america integration the workgroups that have not yet reached a transition agreement could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them the same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs including wage rate increases which could ultimately flow through to us under the applicable services agreement 

although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision future uncertainty around open contractsincluding the collective bargaining negotiations for the integration of alaskas and virgin americas represented work groupscould be a distraction affecting employee focus on our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost achieve and sustain employee engagement in our strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business 

 26 

employees could also engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt our normal operations in an attempt to pressure us to acquiesce to wage or other demands during section 6 negotiations or transition agreement discussions although the railway labor act makes such “selfhelp” unlawful until the national mediation board releases the parties following lengthy mediation attempts such actions could cause significant harm even if we were ultimately successful in seeking injunctive relief or other remedies 

the inability to attract retain and train regional pilots could result in guest impact and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in recent years there have been shortages of pilots for hire in the regional market and there is an anticipated pilot shortage in hiring in the mainline markets in the next two to three years attrition beyond normal levels or the inability to attract new pilots could negatively impact our operating results and our business prospects could be harmed in addition the ability to train pilot candidates in a timely manner to support alaska’s operational needs may continue to be a challenge for horizon air due to the high volume of turnover partially driven by the hiring needs of mainline carriers pilot training may face added stress associated with ensuring initial training recurrent training and upgrades from first officer to captain are accomplished in a manner timely enough to support alaska’s operational needs any of these outcomes would possibly result in guest impact and harm to our business financial condition and results of operations

year in review 

in 2017  we expanded our network at a record pace adding 44 new markets across the network during the year additionally we devoted a significant amount of energy and resources to integrating alaska and virgin america we achieved many integration milestones including merging many backoffice functions colocating many stations and launching technology for frontline employees to enable them to serve our customers seamlessly between carriers 

in 2017  we posted our 14th  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis our pretax income was 12 billion  compared to 13 billion  in 2016 our 2017  pretax income on an adjusted basis a nongaap financial measure was 13 billion  a decrease  of 9  from 2016  adjusted pretax income for 2017  excludes 118 million  of mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america and 7 million  of marktomarket fuel hedge benefit 

the decrease in adjusted pretax income was driven largely by an increase in operating expenses excluding fuel and special items of 15 billion  and an increase in fuel expense of 616 million  the increase in operating expense was primarily due to the fullyear impact of virgin america in our financial results the increased costs were partially offset by an increase in operating revenues of 20 billion  

the growth in revenues of 20 billion  was driven by the growth in our business attributable to the inclusion of virgin america in our results for the full year as well as our expansion into 44 new markets entered into during the year on the regional side of our business horizon began flying the new embraer e175 regional jets in 2017  — the first 10  of 33 aircraft scheduled for delivery over a three year period we believe we have a strong future ahead of us and look forward to the many new opportunities our combined networks will bring our company

shareholder return 

in 2017  we paid cash dividends of 148 million  and repurchased approximately 981 thousand  shares of our common stock for 75 million  under the 1 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in august 2015  as of december 31 2017  the company has repurchased approximately 5 million shares for 388 million under this program 

 34 

since 2007 we have repurchased 60 million  shares of common stock for 16 billion  for an average price of approximately 2672  per share in 2017  we increased our quarterly dividend 9  from 0275  per share to 0300  per share and subsequent to december 31 2017  we announced a 7  increase to 032  per share for 2018 overall we returned 223 million  to shareholders during 2017  we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2018  primarily in the form of dividends 

outlook 

  

in 2018  and beyond we are focused on successfully completing the integration of virgin america with alaska in january 2018 alaska and virgin america received a single operating certificate soc our most significant integration milestone to date the integration milestones achieved thus far will help to ease our transition to a single passenger service system pss on april 25 2018 this will allow us to provide one reservation system one website and one inventory of flights to our guests which will help unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition in conjunction with pss at all gates ticketing and checkin areas guests will be greeted with alaska branding 

we will continue to make investments to enhance our onboard guest experience some of the more notable projects underway include adding satellite connectivity to our entire boeing and airbus fleets to offer highspeed satellite wifi further upgrades to our onboard menu offerings updating and expanding airport lounges in the jfk and seattle airports and investment in our seattle hub airport to open a stateoftheart 20gate north terminal facility 

in 2018 we expect to continue to experience cost pressure due in large part to pilot wage increases which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a new maintenance costperhour agreement that will result in higher maintenance costs in 2018 but will help to reduce the volatility of maintenance expense over the next several years we also expect to continue to incur further costs associated with the ongoing integration of virgin america for the first quarter of 2018 we expect unit revenues rasm to decline 35   45  and unit costs excluding fuel and special items casm ex fuel to increase approximately 6  in addition we expect the price per gallon of jet fuel to increase approximately 21  from the prioryear period based on these current estimates we are likely to report a loss in the first quarter although we expect our unit costs and unit revenues to improve throughout 2018 

our priority throughout the integration process is to run two great airlines and to maintain safe and compliant operations while providing a great experience for our guests we are particularly focused on merging the alaska and virgin america cultures and brands that our guests respect and trust we intend to minimize any disruption to our guests during our integration efforts by being transparent about our progress and how the changes may affect them employee engagement throughout the integration will remain a top priority as well ensuring that employees remain engaged informed and excited about the new companys future additionally we will remain focused on capturing the value and synergies created by combining these two great airlines 

we expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2018  by approximately 75  compared to a 71  combined growth in 2017  current schedules indicate competitive capacity will be roughly 6  points higher in the first quarter of 2018  we believe that our product our operation our engaged employees our awardwinning service and our competitive mileage plan™ combined with our strong balance sheet give us the ability to compete vigorously in our markets

results   of operations 

adjusted nongaap results and   pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

2017  compared with 2016   

our consolidated net income for 2017  was 1 billion  or 835  per diluted share compared to net income of 814 million  or 654  per diluted share in 2016  as the acquisition of virgin america closed on december 14 2016 our 2016 financial results include virgin america for the period of december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of december 14 2016 refer to the critical accounting estimates section for further information regarding purchase accounting 

excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and a special tax benefit as a result of tax reform our adjusted consolidated net income for 2017  was 823 million  or 664  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 911 million  or 732  per share in 2016  the following table reconciles our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share eps during the full year 2017  and 2016  to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

impact of accounting changes 

the following discussion of 2017 compared with 2016 results reflects balances as reported within this 10k on january 1 2018 we will implement asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers and asu 201707 compensation retirement benefits we have elected to apply both standards using the full retrospective approach which will require us to restate prior period financial information under the new standards when providing forward looking guidance on line items that will be recast under the new standards we have included provisional recast amounts herein 

under the new revenue recognition standard the primary changes to our financial information relate to mileage plan™ accounting ticket breakage and ancillary revenue geography 

 

as a result of the new revenue recognition standard we expect to restate 2017 and 2016 financial information in our future filings we expect 2017 reported revenues will be reduced by approximately 41 million  and reported nonfuel operating costs will increase by approximately 13 million  resulting in a net reduction of 54 million  to reported adjusted pretax profit we expect a similar impact in 2018 

 37 

although less significant the new retirement benefits accounting standard is also effective january 1 2018 under this new standard all components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented in nonoperating income expense except service cost which will remain in wages and benefits this change has an impact on casm 

management believes it is useful to compare forecasted results with the restated results under the new standards as noted in the impacted areas below the implementation of the new standards will impact common industry metrics such as prasm rasm and casm excluding fuel and special items we will provide restated metrics in a separate filing

operating statistics summary unaudited 

alaska air group inc 

below are operating statistics we use to measure performance as the acquisition of virgin america closed on december 14 2016 consolidated and mainline amounts presented below include virgin america results for the twelve  months ended december 31 2017  but only for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 in the twelve  months ended december 31 2016  results below we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which is a nongaap measure 





 39 

we believe that analysis of specific financial and operational results on a combined basis provides more meaningful yearoveryear comparisons the discussion below includes combined comparative results for 2016  determined as the sum   of the historical consolidated results of air group and virgin america virgin americas financial information has been conformed to reflect air groups historical financial statement presentation this information does not purport to reflect what our financial and operational results would have been had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented 

combined comparative operating statistics 



 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   20 billion  or 34  during 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  on a combined comparative basis total operating revenues increased   438 million  or 6  the changes including the reconciliation of the impact of virgin america on the comparative results are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue — mainline 

on a consolidated basis mainline passenger revenue for 2017   increased  by 18 billion  or 43  on a 44   increase  in capacity driven by the acquisition of virgin america partially offset by a 1   decrease  in unit revenues compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis mainline passenger revenue increased  by 346 million  or 6  due to a 7  increase in capacity partially offset by a 1  decrease in unit revenue compared to the combined mainline results for 2016 the increase in capacity was driven by our continued network expansion and aircraft added to our fleet in the current year the decrease in prasm was 

 40 

driven by a decrease in ticket yields on relatively flat load factors lower ticket yields pricing were impacted in large part by our new market growth and by competitor pricing actions felt more acutely in our california markets 

passenger revenue — regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 52 million  or 6  compared to 2016  due to a 10   increase  in capacity partially offset by a 4   decrease  in prasm compared to 2016  the increase in capacity is due to an increase in departures from new e175 deliveries an increase in average aircraft stage length and the annualization of new routes introduced over the past twelve months the decrease  in regional prasm was primarily driven by the significant growth in our regional business and competitive pricing actions 

other — net 

other—net revenue increased   184 million  or 23  from 2016  primarily due to increases in frequent flyer program revenue frequent flyer program revenue increased 53 million  or 12  due to an increase in miles sold to our affinity card partner in the the current year on a combined comparative basis other—net revenue increased   34 million  or 4  

under the new revenue recognition standard our 2017 recast revenues will decrease by approximately 41 million  we expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2018 however given our projected capacity growth we expect total revenue will increase in 2018 as we expect to grow our capacity approximately 75  

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   21 billion  or 46  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis total operating expenses increased   749 million  or 13  primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and higher fuel costs among other increases we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2016  are more fully described below 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below and the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases aircraft fuel expense can be volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease 

raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

 41 

aircraft fuel expense increased   616 million  or 74  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis aircraft fuel expense increased 323 million  or 29  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



on a combined comparative basis raw fuel expense per gallon increased   21  due primarily to higher west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2017  was driven by a 38  increase in refining margins and a 17  increase in crude oil prices compared to the prior year fuel gallons consumed increased  by 58 million  or 8  consistent with the increase in capacity of 7  on a combined comparative basis 

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices have on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 17 million  in 2017  compared to losses of 16 million  in 2016  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement 

as of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to increase approximately 21  in the first quarter of 2018  as compared to the first quarter of 2017  due to higher crude oil prices and refining margins as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

 42 

nonfuel expense and nonspecial items 

the table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of virgin america on the comparative results for each of our operating expense line items excluding fuel and special items 



wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2017  by 542 million  or 39  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis total wages and benefits increased  by 258 million  or 15  the primary components of wages and benefits including a reconciliation of 2016 on a combined comparative basis are shown in the following table 



on a combined comparative basis wages increased   222 million  with a 16  increase in ftes the increase in ftes is attributable to the growth in our business and the growth in mcgee air services which has brought certain airport ground service positions inhouse that were previously reflected in contracted services expense additionally wage rates for pilots at alaska and virgin america increased significantly in november 2017 as a result of new contract rates stemming from a decision reached by a thirdparty arbitration panel during the fourth quarter of 2017  

costs associated with our defined contribution plans increased   14 million  or 16  on a combined comparative basis due to fte growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups additionally due to the arbitration decision reached in the fourth quarter of 2017 pilots at alaska and virgin america began receiving contributions at a higher rate 

 43 

pension expense increased   28  compared to the same period in the prior year the increase is due to the change in certain assumptions used at december 31 2016 particularly discount rates which were lowered by 60 to 72 basis points resulting in higher expense recognition in 2017 

under the new retirement benefits accounting standard 2017 recast wages and benefits will increase approximately 7 million  on a recast basis we expect wages and benefits to grow at a greater rate than projected capacity growth in 2018  alaska and virgin america pilot wage increases are the primary drivers of this increase the remainder is due to the expected growth in ftes to support our capacity growth along with higher wage rates medical costs and higher pension costs furthermore we may reach a new agreement with our mainline flight attendants which would also result in higher wages 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  to 135 million  in 2017  from 127 million  in 2016  on a combined comparative basis variable incentive pay decreased   24 million  or 15  due to lower achievement against performancebased pay metrics as compared to the prior year 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased  by 121 million  or 45  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis aircraft maintenance costs increased   41 million  or 12  maintenance costs increased  primarily due to timing of scheduled maintenance events in 2017 as well as a powerbythehour maintenance agreement that began during the fourth quarter of 2017 

we expect aircraft maintenance expense to increase consistent with capacity growth in 2018  we will have an increase in engine maintenance costs primarily due to the full year impact of the powerbythehour engine maintenance arrangement on our b737800 aircraft as noted above as well as general maintenance expenditures increases as we continue to add capacity to our network 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense increased   160 million  or 140  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis aircraft rent expense decreased   10 million  or 4  primarily due to the resetting of straightline aircraft rent resulting from purchase price accounting for leases held by virgin america partially offset by the addition of four  a321neos added to our mainline fleet and eight  e175s added to our regional fleet 

we expect aircraft rent to increase in 2018  at a greater rate than our forecasted capacity growth due to additional leased a321neo and e175 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2018  

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased   140 million  or 44  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis landing fees and other rental expenses increased   33 million  or 8  primarily due to increased flying in 2017  as we increased capacity by 7  on a combined basis and entered into 44 new markets 

we expect landing fees and other rental expense to grow at a slightly greater rate than capacity in 2018  as we continue to add capacity in our network and enter new markets additionally we expect continued rate increases at airports across our network 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   67 million  or 27  when compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis contracted services increased   7 million  or 2  primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us additionally wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve these cost increases were partially offset by insourcing some of the ground services at many airports to mcgee air services whose costs are now included in other financial statement line items particularly wages and benefits 

we expect contracted services to increase in 2018  consistent with our projected capacity growth the increases are primarily due to higher wage rates in locations where we use vendor employees and ongoing information technology and facilities projects that we use outside contractors to assist with 

 44 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 132 million  or 59  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis selling expenses increased   9 million  or 3  mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities as well as new sponsorships which became effective in the current year 

under the new revenue recognition standard our 2017 recast selling expense will increase by approximately 13 million  we expect selling expense to decrease  in 2018 on a recast basis due primarily to a decrease in advertising spend forecasted as well as decreased mileage plan partner airline expense due to the termination of certain partnerships with other airlines 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 9 million  or 2  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis depreciation and amortization expense decreased   28 million  or 7  primarily due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain b737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years which was effective october 1 2016 partially offset by the addition of 14  b737900ers and 10  e175s to our fleet since december 31 2016  

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in line with capacity growth in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to scheduled b737900er and e175 aircraft deliveries in 2018  

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expense increased  by 69 million  or 55  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis food and beverage service expenses increased   20 million  or 11  due to the increased number of passengers premium class offerings and enhancements to our onboard menu offerings to provide higher quality food and beverage products 

we expect food and beverage expenses to increase in line with capacity growth in 2018 compared to 2017  primarily due to an expected increase in number of passengers as we continue to grow our network and higher product costs 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements increased   26 million  or 27  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase is primarily due to the addition of eight  e175 aircraft operated by skywest in the current year 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to increase in 2018  as we add e175 aircraft to be operated by skywest and continue to expand our regional network 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   200 million  or 55  compared to 2016  on a combined comparative basis other operating expenses increased   114 million  or 25  primarily due to higher costs associated with crew costs such as hotels and per diems training higher it costs an increase in scrapped parts inventory and higher property taxes 

we expect other operating expenses to increase consistent with capacity growth in 2018  driven primarily by increased personnel costs such as meals and hotels 

special items—mergerrelated costs and other 

we recorded special items of 118 million  for mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america in 2017  compared to 117 million  in 2016  which reflects the results of virgin america from december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and 138 million on a combined comparative basis in 2016  costs incurred in 2017  consisted primarily of severance and retention costs and it integration costs we expect to continue to incur mergerrelated costs through 2019 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2017  we recorded nonoperating expense of 53 million  compared to nonoperating expense of 4 million  in 2016  on a combined comparative basis nonoperating expense increased  by 30 million  primarily due to interest expense incurred in the current year on the debt issued in 2016 to finance the acquisition of virgin america

additional segment information 

refer to note 12  of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

mainline adjusted pretax profit was 13 billion  in 2017  compared to 13 billion  in 2016  on a combined comparative basis mainline adjusted pretax profit decreased by 253 million  the table below provides the reconciliation of the impact of virgin america on the comparative results for our mainline segment excluding mergerrelated costs and marktomarket fuelhedge accounting charges 



the 253 million decrease in combined comparative pretax profit was driven by a 270 million   increase  in mainline fuel expense a 346 million increase in mainline nonfuel operating expenses and a 23 million increase in nonoperating expense these increases were partially offset by a 386 million increase in mainline passenger revenue higher raw fuel prices and an increase in gallons consumed to support additional flying drove the increase in mainline fuel expense nonfuel operating expenses increased due to higher wages to support our growth and higher operating expenses as described above nonoperating expense increased primarily due to increased interest expense mainline revenue increased due to higher capacity from new routes added over the past twelve months 

regional 

our regional operations contributed a pretax profit of 15 million  in 2017  compared to 93 million  in 2016  the 78 million  decrease in pretax profit was attributable to 82 million  higher nonfuel operating expense due in large part to increased capacity and higher raw fuel costs partially offset by a 51 million increase in operating revenues as described in passenger revenue—regional 

horizon 

horizon incurred a pretax loss of 8 million  in 2017  compared to pretax profit of 14 million  in 2016  the change was primarily driven by 20 million  higher nonfuel expenses nonfuel expenses increased primarily due to higher wage and training expense as a result of the increase in fte’s increased costs associated with flight cancellations and a 9 million ratification bonus expense in connection with the agreement reached with horizons pilots 

 46 

2016  compared with 2015 

our consolidated net income for 2016  was 814 million  or 654  per diluted share compared to net income of 848 million  or 656  per diluted share in 2015  our financial results include results of virgin america for the period from december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of december 14 2016 refer to the critical accounting estimates section for further information regarding purchase accounting 

excluding the impact of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and special items our adjusted consolidated net income for 2016  was 911 million  or 732  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 842 million  or 651  per share in 2015  the following tables reconcile our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share eps during the full year 2016 and 2015 to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

passenger revenue—mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2016   increased  by 4  due to a 10  increase in capacity partially offset by a 5  decrease in prasm compared to 2015  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes and growth in our operating fleet virgin america capacity from the acquisition date through december 31 2016 represented approximately 2 points of capacity increase from 2015 the decrease in prasm was driven by a 6  decrease in ticket yield due to competitive pressures and our own growth offset by a slight increase in load factor furthermore the decline in fuel prices during 2016 contributed to lower ticket prices

regional passenger revenue increased  by 54 million  or 6  compared to 2015  due to a 17  increase in capacity partially offset by a 9  decrease in prasm compared to 2015  the increase in capacity was due to an increase in departures from new e175 deliveries an increase in average aircraft stage length and the annualization of new routes introduced over the past twelve months the decrease in prasm was due to a 7  decrease in ticket yield as well as a decrease in load factor of 11 point s the decrease in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as well as an increase in the average trip length of our regional flights 

  

other—net 

other — net revenue increased   120 million  or 17  from 2015  primarily due to increases in mileage plan™ revenue mileage plan™ revenue increased 100 million or 30 due to increased miles sold and improved compensation terms with our mileage plan™ affinity credit card partner as a result of a contract extension effective january 1 2016 additionally mileage plan™ revenue earned from our partner airlines increased as compared to the prior year 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   282 million  or 7  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and 117 million of mergerrelated costs partially offset by lower fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 

significant operating expense variances from 2015  are more fully described below 

 48 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2016  by 128 million  or 10  compared to 2015  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   8  on a 7  increase in ftes the increase in wages was primarily attributable to fte growth to support our growth and an increase in the average wages per employee 

medical and other benefits increased 25 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and highcost medical claims 

defined contribution plans increased 12  due to fte growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups 

pension expense decreased 11 compared to the same period in the prior year the decrease was due to a change in several assumptions used at december 31 2015 including a higher discount rate updated retirement age assumptions future salary increase assumptions and others that resulted in lower expense recognition in 2016 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased to 127 million  in 2016  from 120 million  in 2015  the increase was primarily due to a higher wage base 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense decreased   123 million  or 13  compared to 2015  the elements of the change are summarized in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 9  in line with the 11  increase capacity partially offset by a 1  improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by asms per gallon 

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 19 as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil and the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2016  was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 11 and a decrease in refining margins of 36 when compared to the prior year 

 49 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 16 million  in 2016  compared to losses of 19 million  in 2015  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased  by 17 million  or 7  compared to 2015  maintenance costs increased primarily due to more engine and airframe maintenance events than in 2015 additionally in 2015 we received vendor credits which offset expense for engine maintenance that had been previously completed on the b737 fleet 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense increased by 9 million or 9 compared to 2015 primarily due to the addition of rent expense on the 53 airbus aircraft leased by virgin america for the period december 14 2016 to december 31 2016 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased   24 million  or 8  primarily due to increased flying in 2016  as we increased capacity and entered into new markets 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   33 million  or 15  when compared to 2015  the increase was primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us additionally wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due in part to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve we also had several information technology and facilities projects that required contracted support 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased by 14 million  or 7  compared to 2015  mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities as well as new sponsorships which became effective in 2016 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 43 million  or 13  compared to 2015  the increase was primarily due to the addition of 19 b737900ers to our fleet since december 31 2015 partially offset by a change in the estimated useful lives of certain b737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years which became effective october 1 2016 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased by 13 million  or 12  due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu offering higher quality food and beverage products 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpas increased   23 million  or 32  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase was primarily due to the significant increase in regional capacity in 2016 through the introduction of e175 flying 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   9 million  or 3  compared to 2015  the increase was primarily due to increases in property and other taxes personnel costs for our flight crews and an increase in fines and penalties 

special items—mergerrelated costs and other 

we recorded special items of 117 million  for mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america these costs consisted primarily of legal expenses investment banking fees and severance costs our 2015 special items of 32 million consisted of a noncash pension settlement expense and costs related to ongoing litigation 

 50 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2016  we recorded nonoperating expense of 4 million  compared to nonoperating income of 14 million  in 2015  in 2016  we incurred more interest expense associated with the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of virgin america this expense was partially offset by additional interest income earned during the period we held those funds in advance of the acquisition close date 

additional segment information 

refer to note 12  of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

pretax profit for mainline was 13 billion  in 2016  compared to 12 billion  in 2015  this segment includes financial results of virgin america from the date of acquisition through december 31 2016 the 135 million  increase was due to an increase in operating revenues of 277 million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of 126 million  revenue growth was primarily driven by the 159 million  increase in passenger revenues and the 100 million increase in mileage plan™ revenue both described previously growth in operating expenses was due to higher wages to support our network growth higher ramp and passenger handling due to increased flying and higher wage rates at stations where we use vendors to assist us higher depreciation related to our fleet growth and selling expenses related to increased advertising economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency slightly offset by an 8 increase in consumption 

regional 

pretax profit for regional was 93 million  in 2016  compared to 105 million  in 2015  the 12 million  decrease in pretax profit was driven by a 74 million increase in nonfuel operating expenses in 2016 to support additional departures partially offset by a 56 million  increase in revenue and a 6 million decrease in fuel expense when compared to the prior year period 

  

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 14 million  in 2016  compared to 28 million  in 2015  cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation increased due to additional capacity added in 2016 the 32 million  increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was largely driven by higher medical costs due to an increased number of large medical claims increased volume of engine overhaul and heavy airframe work employee signing bonuses and overhead restructuring costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

in 2017  we took delivery of 14  b737900er and 10  e175 aircraft and made debt payments totaling 397 million  we also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling 148 million  and repurchasing 75 million  of our common stock because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance we are one of only three airlines in the us with investment grade credit ratings 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future 

 51 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



   

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 16 billion  in 2017  compared to 14 billion  in 2016  the increase of 204 million  is primarily due to an increase in our net income 

in 2016  we generated 14 billion  in operating cash flows compared to 16 billion  in 2015  the decrease of 200 million was due to a decline in operating results primarily driven by an increase in nonfuel operating expenses—including 117 million  million in mergerrelated costs associated with the acquisition of virgin america—partially offset by higher revenues and lower fuel costs 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment to make debt payments and to return capital to shareholders during 2016 we paused our share repurchase program as we prepared for the acquisition of virgin america we resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 11 billion  during 2017  compared to 26 billion  in 2016  in 2016  cash from investing activities included approximately 2 billion  of cash paid for the acquisition of virgin america which drove a decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2017  when compared to the prior year our capital expenditures were 1 billion  or 348 million   higher  than in 2016  primarily as a result of the purchase of more aircraft in the current year during 2017  we took delivery of 14  b737900ers and 10  e715 aircraft this compares to the delivery of 19  b737900ers in the prior year our future expected capital expenditures are summarized in the contractual obligations and commitments section 

cash used in investing activities was 26 billion  during 2016  compared to 930 million  in 2015  we used 2 billion  to acquire virgin america representing 26 billion  consideration paid offset by 645 million  of cash acquired our capital expenditures were 678 million  in 2016  153 million lower than in 2015 

 52 

cash provided by financing activities 

  

cash used in financing activities was 592 million  during 2017  compared to cash provided by financing activities of 15 billion  in 2016  during the year we made debt payments of 397 million  repurchased 75 million  of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 148 million  in 2016  we secured debt proceeds of 2 billion  for the acquisition of virgin america made debt payments of 249 million  stock repurchases of 193 million  and made cash dividend payments of 136 million  in 2015  we made debt payments of 116 million  stock repurchases of 505 million  and cash dividend payments of 102 million  

  

we plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand internally generated cash from operations along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lines of credit 

  

we have three  credit facilities with availability totaling 475 million  including one 250 million  credit facility one 150 million  credit facility and one 75 million  credit facility we have secured letters of credit against the 75 million  facility but have no plans to borrow using either of the two  remaining facilities 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase and lease commitments 

  

as of december 31 2017  we have firm orders to purchase or lease 85  aircraft we also have cancelable purchase commitments for 30  airbus a320neo aircraft with deliveries from 2020  through 2022  we could incur a loss of predelivery payments and credits of up to 15 million  as a cancellation fee we also have options to acquire up to 37  additional b737 aircraft with deliveries from 2020  through 2024  and 30  e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2020  to 2022  in addition to the 23  e175 aircraft currently operated by skywest in our regional fleet we have firm orders to lease 12  e175 aircraft with deliveries in 2018  and options in future periods to add regional capacity by having skywest operate up to eight  more e175 aircraft 

we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 1 billion  in 2018  and approximately 750 million  in 2019  and 2020  we currently expect delivery of eight  owned mainline jet aircraft and 13  owned regional jet aircraft in 2018  

the following table summarizes our expected fleet count by year as of february 14 2018  



 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through cash from operations longterm debt or lease arrangements 

 53 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 



contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our obligations as of december 31 2017  for agreements with variable terms amounts included reflect our minimum obligations 



 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 304 million  at december 31 2017  compared to a 197 million  unfunded position at december 31 2016  this results in an 87  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 90  funded as of december 31 2016  we contributed approximately 15 million  in 2017  to the plans 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

 54 

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the shortterm are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices usage of net operating losses whether bonus depreciation provisions are available any future tax reform efforts at the federal level as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2017  we made tax payments net of refunds totaling 177 million  and had an effective tax rate of 143  largely due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 245 for 2018 and the effective rate of cash paid for income taxes to be approximately 1015 of book income although these estimates are subject to change we believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

frequent flyer programs 

  

alaskas mileage plan™ loyalty program awards miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners we also sell services including miles for transportation to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a major bank that offers alaska affinity credit cards in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

  

for miles earned by guests who fly on us or our airline partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future for services sold through one of our nonairline partners the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other—net revenue in the period the services are performed commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 396 million  329 million  and 280 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when the award travel occurs or the miles expire and as other — net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2017  we had approximately 220 billion  miles and points outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 12 billion  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan™ are described below 

  

 55 

   

we use the relative selling price method for the deferral of sales proceeds for contracts that were modified after the effective date of accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 200913 we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables this relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables a 1 shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately 9 million  

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan™ mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage considers historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors based on statistical analysis of historical data our current breakage rate is 174  a hypothetical 1 change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a 10 million  effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan™ program and historical award redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the guest travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the guest the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that guest we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan™ assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

see further discussion below for the impact to the accounting of frequent flyer programs due to the new revenue recognition accounting standard 

pension plans 

  

our actuarial estimates of pension liability the related expense and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of key assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rates to be used in the calculation of the projected 

 56 

benefit obligation and the interest and service cost changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate used for the obligation increases we discounted future pension obligations using rates between 369  and 378  at december 31 2017  and between 429  and 450  at december 31 2016  the discount rates were determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from each one  of the definedbenefit pension plans the discount rates we use are based on a yield curve that uses a pool of higheryielding bonds estimated to be more in line with settlement rates as we have taken steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future if the discount rate decreased by 05  our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2017  would increase by approximately 163 million  

pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2017  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate longterm rates of return between 425  and 550  which compares to 55  and 600  at december 31 2016  we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2017  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities us fixedincome securities and real estate a decrease in the expected longterm rate of return of 05  would increase our estimated 2018  pension expense by approximately 10 million  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans were frozen january 1 2014 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

see further discussion below for the impact to the accounting of pension plans due to the new retirement benefits accounting standard 

  

business combination accounting goodwill and intangibles 

to record the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of our acquisition of virgin america on december 14 2016 we have performed a purchase price allocation utilizing the best information available to management the purchase price allocation is final as of december 14 2017 the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using market income or cost methods our consolidated balance sheet reflects goodwill in the amount of  19 billion  at december 31 2017  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities identifiable intangible assets recorded totaled approximately  141 million  at december 31 2017  and consisted of customer relationships airport slots and gates with the exception of airport slots all of the identified intangible assets are finitelived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 

our impairment analysis may include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount we will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 

qualitative factors that might indicate a need to perform an impairment analysis outside of the regular annual assessment could include but are not limited to 1 reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions 2 significantly ongoing higher prices for jet fuel 3 significant ongoing lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand 4 a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments and 5 significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities actual or threatened war labor actions by employees or further industry regulation 

our business combination accounting as well as future impairment analyses require management to make assumptions and apply judgment key assumptions include but are not limited to estimating future cash flows selecting discount rates and selecting valuation methodologies these estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations may be affected by changes in economic condition our economic performance or business strategies 

 57 

adoption of new accounting standards 

the new revenue recognition standard issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in us gaap and is effective for the company beginning january 1 2018 

the most significant change to the financial statements resulting from the new standard is revenue recognition related to the frequent flyer program revenues and liabilities historically we have used the incremental cost approach for miles earned through travel this approach has been eliminated with the new standard instead we are required to allocate a portion of the ticket price for each ticket flown or miles earned through a relative selling price model and defer revenue recognition until a mileage award is redeemed and flown or unused mileage credits expire as our mileage plan™ program is growing the company expects revenue deferred will exceed revenue earned under the new standard for miles earned through travel 

further unused ticket revenue that was previously recorded at the time of expiration will now be recorded at the original departure date if that ticket has not been changed or refunded prior to that date based on estimates of expected expiration using historical patterns we estimate the change in ticket breakage methodology will not have a significant impact on the statements of operations but will result in a reduction in air traffic liability compared to previously reported balances 

the new standard also requires us to present ancillary revenues related to passenger travel as passenger revenue historically such ancillary revenues have been presented as other revenues further some ancillary revenues related to passenger travel will be recognized at the date of travel rather than the date of sale under the new standard 

it is worth noting that the standard impacts the timing of revenue recognition and is not indicative of a weaker revenue environment additionally the standard does not impact the timing of cash flows 

although less significant the new retirement benefits accounting standard is also effective january 1 2018 under this new standard all components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented in nonoperating income expense except service cost which will remain in wages and benefits this change has an impact on casm excluding fuel and special items management believes it is useful to compare forecasted results with the restated results under the new standards 

we have provisionally modeled the impacts of the revenue recognition standard and the pension accounting standard and expect the following changes to the statements of operations for the years ending december 31 2016 and december 31 2017 all adjustments and recast amounts below are subject to finalization upon implementation in 2018

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2017  would change the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 55 million  or 6 million  respectively 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 22 million  at december 31 2017  compared to a portfolio value of 20 million  at december 31 2016  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2017  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have a number of interest rate swaps that fix the interest rates on certain variablerate debt agreements a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on average variablerate debt held during 2017  would have correspondingly changed our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 4 million  our variablerate debt represents approximately 63  and 61  of our total longterm debt as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively 

our exposure to interest rate variability is further mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 point more than they did in 2017  interest income would increase by approximately 16 million

air group operates alaska virgin america and horizon air we completed the acquisition of virgin america on december 14 2016 at which time virgin america became our whollyowned subsidiary together with our regional partner airlines we fly to 118  destinations with nearly 1200 daily departures through our expansive network across the united states mexico canada costa rica and cuba with our global airline partners we can provide our guests with a virtual network of more than 900  destinations worldwide during 2016  we carried an alltime high 34 million  guests and earned adjusted net income of 911 million  which includes operating and financial results for virgin america for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and excludes pretax special items and mergerrelated costs of  117 million  

our acquisition of virgin america positions us as the fifth largest airline in the us with an unparalleled ability to serve west coast travelers virgin america provides a platform for growth of our lowfare premium product providing a powerful west coast network for our guests as well as enhanced international partnerships additionally virgin america provides an opportunity to grow and improve our loyalty program while gaining access to constrained gates particularly on the east coast the combined company now provides more seats from the west coast than any other carrier allowing us to serve our guests better 

our mission is creating an airline people love the ing is to recognize we are never done — we are continually working to get better we believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively it is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just our performance but also our people our community and our environment 

while aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation we recognize this is fundamentally a people business our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with guests and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute our strategy in 2016 alaska was once again named one of americas best employers by forbes magazine we know that engaged employees provide excellent service in that vein in 2016  alaska ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by jd power and associates for the ninth  year in a row and virgin america was recognized for excellent service by conde nast traveler and travel  leisure magazine also for the ninth year in a row customer service matters and we believe the combination of our airlines will only enhance the experience for our guests 

operationally alaska has held the no 1 spot in the wall street journals middle seat scorecard for us airlines for four consecutive years we have been the leader in the industry for ontime performance among major airlines for the past seven years for achieving safety customer service operational and financial goals we rewarded our employees with a record 127 million  in incentive pay during 2016  including incentives earned during the year prior to the acquisition by virgin america employees the total is 159 million  

in support of the communities that we serve we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship in 2016  we improved fuel efficiency by 14  from the prior year as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon we also flew the first two commercial flights using sustainable alcoholtojet biofuel made from us grown corn and alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals highlighting our commitment to environmental stewardship our combined fleet is one of the youngest most fuelefficient fleets in north america and we look forward to further enhancements in this area air group donated 13 million to over 1300 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 27000 hours of community service virgin america has also been active in community service and charitable giving our efforts focus on youth and education medical research and transportation and community outreach one of our leadership principals is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and volunteerism of our employees across the system 

we earned record financial results in 2016  marking our 13th  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis we achieved an aftertax return on invested capital of 213  well above our weighted average cost of capital although we incurred a significant amount of new debt in 2016 to fund the virgin america acquisition our liquidity and capital position still remain strong and are among those of highquality industrial companies due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three us airlines with investment grade credit ratings with the cash generated by the continued success we have had in the past decade we have been able to invest in our business to achieve profitable growth and to enhance the customer experience most recently we launched our premium class service on our boeing 737 aircraft which includes more legroom early boarding free cocktails and premium snacks

as we look to the future we will build on our success by executing our strategic plan in the following areas 

be safe and on time 

we have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives alaska and horizon were the first us major airlines to receive federal aviation administration faa validation and acceptance of our safety management system sms in the third quarter of 2016 sms helps identify and manage risk and builds a sustainable culture of safety for air group employees we have an initiative to add virgin america to the sms program in 2017 once again for 2016 100 of our alaska and horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the faas diamond certificate of excellence award this is the 15th consecutive year alaska airlines has received the award and the 15th time in the last 17 years for horizon we also believe that maintaining safe and compliant operations through adherence to well defined processes and ensuring every air group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance the rigor we apply to running a safe and compliant operation has resulted in alaska being named the no 1 ontime carrier in north america for the seventh year in a row by flightstats 

focus on people 

our success depends on our people higher employee engagement drives higher productivity superior execution and better customer service which is why we listen to our employees for feedback in shaping our strategy employee engagement scores from our annual employee survey are at historical highs we have designed customerservice workshops and leadership training that cover virtually all employees and do these on an ongoing basis as we integrate alaska and virgin america in january 2017 we rolled out momentum training for all virgin america employees to help bridge the two airlines and blend our cultures for our horizon employees we are conducting qx factor a program with the goal of improving culture engagement and communication 

we understand that aligning our employees goals with air groups goals is important in achieving success the majority of air group employees including virgin america employees starting in 2017 participate in our performancebased pay pbp and operational performance rewards opr programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety profitability ontime performance low costs and customer loyalty and satisfaction over the last five years our incentive programs have paid out on average over 87 of annual pay or more than one months pay for most employees 

build a deep emotional connection for our brand 

we want to be recognized as the preferred airline to fly for people living on the west coast in january 2016 we introduced a bold new brand expression including an updated identity livery and look and feel for our digital and physical experiences in january 2017 subsequent to year end we were the first airline to launch free chat — a feature that allows our guests to text for free inflight we believe there is an opportunity to deepen the emotional connection with our guests as we continue to expand and grow our updated brand expression draws upon our rich heritage while infusing it with additional warmth and energy to better reflect how guests feel about our brand and the great service that we pride ourselves in delivering 

we continue to invest in a better customer experience onboard guests will continue to enjoy more of what they love with free and premium entertainment direct to their devices pacific northwestinspired food and beverages custom leather seats with power outlets at every seat and larger overhead bins for carryon bags as mentioned previously we have also recently launched our new premium class section in the main cabin with increased legroom and other amenities and improved our first class with five additional inches of leg room 

defend and grow our customer base 

the merger with virgin america provides an amazing opportunity for our new alaska air group we have a network that provides unparalleled utility and options for our guests living on the west coast competition in our markets is fierce and we know we must defend our customer base as we use our combined network as an opportunity to grow that base we will be introducing new guests to our awardwinning service mileage plan™ program and affinity credit card as we grow our network guests from our airlines already benefit from codeshare and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits including earning and redeeming rewards on both carriers elite members of the virgin america elevate® program and alaskas mileage plan™ also receive priority boarding on both carriers we work hard to ensure our guests have a great experience on our airlines and are provided an exceptional product at a low fare 

 5 

win with low costs and low fares 

we believe that our lowfare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing value to and building trust with our guests we also know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while returning value to our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure in 2016  we lowered our unit costs excluding fuel by 08  on a consolidated basis representing the seventh consecutive year of annual reduction we achieved this through a continued focus on productivity cost management and by leveraging capacity growth we increased employee productivity in 2016  and will continue to focus on that metric as we grow we also manage fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 70  over the last five years as we integrate virgin america into our operations we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals it is critical that we achieve these goals in order to continue our cost reduction efforts 

during fiscal 2016  we added 17  new markets to the combined network for 2017  we plan to grow our systemwide capacity approximately 85  as compared to the full year 2016 combined capacity of air group and virgin america 

air group 

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of alaska virgin america horizon and other business units although alaska virgin america and horizon operate as airlines the business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially for horizon in comparison to alaska and virgin america alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 virgin america is a california corporation that was incorporated in 2004 and acquired by air group on december 14 2016  horizon is a washington corporation that began service and was incorporated in 1981 it was acquired by air group in 1986 alaska and virgin america operate fleets of narrowbody passenger jets together the operations of alaska and virgin america are referred to as mainline operations alaska also contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity such that alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon currently operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement cpa in 2017 horizon will begin operating e175 regional jets the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers the percentage of revenues by category is as follows 



 

we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in ways that best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce our seasonality 

the percentage of our capacity by region is as follows

in 2016  we carried 25 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations at december 31 2016  our mainline operating fleet consisted of 155  b737 jet aircraft and 63  airbus a320 family jet aircraft compared to 147  b737 aircraft as of december 31 2015  

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



 

regional 

  

our regional operations consist of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2016  our regional operations carried approximately 9 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and carries about 83  of air groups regional revenue passengers 

based on 2016  passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our leading airports are seattle and portland at december 31 2016  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 52  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft the regional fleet operated by skywest consisted of 15  e175 aircraft 

the percentage of regional passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



frequent flyer programs 

we currently maintain two frequent flyer plans the alaska airlines mileage plan™ and the virgin america elevate® 

mileage plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits miles can be earned by flying on alaska or on one of our 24  airline partners by using the alaska airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners our extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer programs and have access to a large network of over 900  worldwide travel 

 7 

destinations further members can receive 30000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and earn triple miles on purchases made on alaska flights or on alaskaaircom alaska airlines visa signature cardholders also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling in the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or on any of our partner airlines or for upgrades to first class and premium class on alaska airlines all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value for their travel on alaska leading us to receive the highest ranking in customer satisfaction amongst traditional carriers in north america from jd power and associates for the last nine  consecutive years 

mileage plan™ revenues represented approximately 12  of air groups total revenues in 2016 mileage plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 

the elevate® program allows guests to earn points for purchasing travel that are redeemable for travel awards throughout our network and the networks of virgin americas airline partners elevate® members have been introduced to the mileage plan™ program and over time the two programs will become one currently our guests from both airlines enjoy codeshare and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits including earning and redeeming rewards on both carriers elite members of each frequent flyer program receive priority boarding on both carriers 

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements frequent flyer agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our mileage plan™ and elevate® members alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our mileage plan™ members through our frequent flyer partnerships with 24  domestic and international carriers 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats is sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests 

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time 

on december 19 2016 we announced the termination of our codeshare agreement with delta air lines delta effective april 30 2017 our interline agreement with delta will continue we expect the impact to our guests in 2017 to be minimal due to growth in alaskas own network in large part from our acquisition of virgin america and our ability to codeshare with other 

 8 

partners we also believe the financial exposure from the termination of our codeshare agreement with delta will be immaterial to our financial results in 2017 

the comprehensive summary of alaska horizon and skywest alliances with other airlines is as follows 



 

the comprehensive summary of virgin america alliances with other airlines is as follows 



 

 9 

the following is the financial impact of our marketing alliances 



 

other revenue 

other revenue consists of freight and mail certain frequent flyer and ancillary revenue while some of our product features are included in our base pricing we have unbundled certain ancillary features that our guests separately value major ancillary revenue products include checked bag fees change fees and lounge memberships we also promote and sell products inflight to enhance the guest experience including our tom douglas signature meals snacks alcoholic beverages inflight entertainment and wifi total other revenue excluding frequent flyer program revenue represents about 7  of our total revenues 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2016  the airline industry reported historically high revenues and profits as the global economy continued to recover and oil prices remained low as the industry strengthens airlines are now making significant investments in airports in new planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering thus the level of competition is expected to increase 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18  to 35  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the us 

  

the prices we have paid for crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of 43  per barrel in 2016  to a high of 98  in 2013 for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 18 million  of fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 7 million  per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years average annual refining margin prices have fluctuated between 13  per barrel and 36  per barrel in the last five years and averaged 13  in 2016  

 10 

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased   19  in 2016  39 in 2015  and 6 in 2014  

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



 

we use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices historically we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts but we discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in 2014 call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet virgin america operates an allairbus a320 family fleet and horizon currently operates an allbombardier q400 turboprop fleet air groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 745  asmsg in 2012  to 797  asmsg in 2016  these improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta who has significantly increased their capacity in seattle over the past few years approximately 61 of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 5 in the first half of 2017  weighted based on our network 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests 

  

   

 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance guest amenities—including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2016  alaska airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by jd power and associates for the ninth  year in a row in 2016  we began installing boeing space bins on our boeing 737900er fleet providing additional overhead bin space for our guests in 2017 we are launching a premium class of service on our b737 aircraft that will provide extra legroom early boarding premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage additionally in 2017 we are increasing the distance between seats in our first class cabins on the alaska b737900 and b737900er fleet providing significantly more space for guests flying in the first class cabin we expect to fully complete the first class cabin upgrades on the b737900 and b737900er fleet in early 2018 

 11 

cabins of our virgin america airbus a320 family fleet have a distinctive appearance through innovative design and use of technology every cabin features special mood lighting designed to create a calming lowstress environment for our guests custom leather seats tailored to provide comfort especially on our longhaul flights inflight wireless internet access and electrical power outlets adjacent to every seat all of our guests flying on virgin america aircraft have access to the red ® inflight entertainment system that allows each guest to customize his or her inflight experience through a host of entertainment options ondemand food and beverage ordering system and a seattoseat chat function 

our employees are a key element of our product we have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a high degree of service and hospitality to our guests both at the airport and in flight we heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys 

  

 

the pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing approximately 82 of total seats accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields we will defend our core markets vigorously and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe the restructuring weve completed over the past decade has decreased our costs enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning appropriate returns for our shareholders 

 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles our frequent flyer programs offer some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 24  of our partner carriers 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets our airlines to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   



 12 

  

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



 

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have significantly improved the seasonality of our operations by our continued growth from the west coast to leisure destinations like hawaii and costa rica and expanding to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• changes in fuel costs 

  

   

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems we also are more susceptible to ground delays due to our heavy concentration of departures from san francisco international airport 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2016  we employed 19112   12224  at alaska 3252  at virgin america and 3636  at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 40  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in both 2016  and 2015  

most major airlines including alaska and horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand at december 31 2016  labor unions represented 84  of alaska’s and 43  of horizon’s employees inflight teammates our term for flight attendants at virgin america and pilots at virgin america voted to be represented by unions on 

 13 

august 13 2014 and june 4 2015 respectively however as of december 31 2016 neither virgin america work group had completed collective bargaining agreement negotiations 

our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2016  were as follows 



a   on december 12 2016 alaska reached a tentative agreement with amfa on a proposed fiveyear contract if ratified the new contract would become amendable in october 2021 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2016  were as follows 



virgin americas union contracts at december 31 2016  were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

 16 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund amendments and reauthorization act and the oil pollution control act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

we believe there may be local or federal legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber liability policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprise wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterpriselevel risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such event substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives this would harm our business 

 18 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

as is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

factors that might impact our operations include 

 

 

   

 

   

 

 

 

due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protection 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels these initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements and health care mandates they could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructures and other additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

 19 

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems and information technology infrastructure and services 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly on the west coast and in our seattle hub resulting in increased competition for those destinations increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the west coast this results in a high concentration of our business in key west coast markets a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2016  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 61  of our total guests we expect this to become more diversified in the future as a result of the recent acquisition of virgin america whose primary hubs are san francisco and los angeles 

 20 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts virgin america is similarly dependent on airbus and horizon is dependent on bombardier and soon embraer additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type as a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska or virgin america codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program or virgin americas elevate® program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer programs the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ and elevate® programs which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

 21 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs in 2017 subsequent to year end we migrated to a new crew management system we also plan to move our primary data center location disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs 

we accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints 

we incurred a significant amount of new debt to finance our acquisition of virgin america we now have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures acquisitions working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

see liquidity and capital resources within item 7 of this filing for more detailed information about our obligations and commitments 

 22 

certain of our financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us 

certain of our credit facilities and indentures governing our secured borrowings impose certain operating and financial covenants on us such covenants require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios and other negative covenants customary for such financings a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and we may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet 

as of december 31 2016  the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737800 900 900ers was approximately 73  years the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 10  years and the average age of our a319 and a320 aircraft was approximately 68  years our relatively new aircraft currently require less maintenance than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all our guests 

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs 

in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses each of alaska and horizons represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement through negotiations or transition agreements in the virgin america integration each group could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them the same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs including wage rate increases which could ultimately flow through to us under the applicable services agreement 

as of december 31 2016  labor unions represented approximately 84  of alaska’s and 43  of horizon’s employees although virgin america employees are not currently covered under collective bargaining agreements pilots and inflight teammates have elected to be represented and will through negotiations ultimately enter into joint collective bargaining agreements with alaskas represented workforce although we have been successful in fostering communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts — including the joint collective bargaining negotiations for the integration of alaskas and virgin americas represented work groups — could be a distraction affecting employee focus on our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in our strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in recent years there have been pilot shortages in hiring in the regional market and there is an anticipated pilot shortage in hiring in the mainline markets in the next two to three years attrition beyond normal levels could negatively impact our operating results and our business prospects could be harmed 

 23 

employees could also engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt our normal operations in an attempt to pressure us to acquiesce to wage or other demands during section 6 negotiations or transition agreement discussions although the railway labor act makes such “selfhelp” unlawful until the national mediation board releases the parties following lengthy mediation attempts and we could seek injunctive relief or other remedies against premature selfhelp such actions could cause significant harm even if we were ultimately to be successful 

acquisition and integration of virgin america 

we may be unable to effectively integrate virgin america’s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in addition delays in integration could cause anticipated synergies to take longer to realize than currently anticipated 

we must devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of virgin america potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis or at all these factors could also reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results in addition integration requirements have caused and may continue to cause a delay of other strategic initiatives 

the virgin brand is not under our control and negative publicity related to the virgin brand name could materially adversely affect our business 

virgin america licenses rights to the virgin brand from certain entities affiliated with the virgin group on a nonexclusive basis the virgin brand is also licensed to and used by a number of other companies including two airlines virgin atlantic airways and virgin australia airlines operating in other geographies we rely on the general goodwill of consumers and our employees towards the virgin brand consequently any adverse publicity in relation to the virgin brand name its principals particularly sir richard branson who is closely associated with the brand or another virginbranded company over which we have no control or influence could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we obtain our rights to use the virgin brand under agreements with certain entities affiliated with the virgin group and we would lose those rights if these agreements are terminated or not renewed 

virgin america is a party to license agreements with certain entities affiliated with the virgin group pursuant to which we obtain rights to use the virgin brand the licensor may terminate the agreements upon the occurrence of a number of specified events including if virgin america commits a material breach of our obligations under the agreements that is uncured for more than 10 business days or if we materially damage the virgin brand if we lose our rights to use the virgin brand we would lose the goodwill associated with the brand name which would likely require substantial expenditures and our business and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 

 24 

the need to integrate virgin america’s workforce into joint collective bargaining agreements with alaskas workforce presents the potential for delay in achieving expected synergies and other benefits or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs 

the successful integration of virgin america and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition depend significantly on integrating virgin america’s employees into alaska and on maintaining productive employee relations failure to do so presents the potential for delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs the process for integrating labor groups in an airline merger is governed by a combination of the railway labor act the mccaskillbond act and where applicable the existing provisions of our collective bargaining agreements “cbas” and internal union policies 

under the railway labor act the national mediation board has exclusive authority to resolve representation disputes arising out of airline mergers the disputes that the national mediation board has authority to resolve include i whether the carriers through the merger have integrated operations to the point of creating a “single transportation system” for representation purposes ii determination of the appropriate “craft or class” for representational purposes including a determination of which positions are to be included within a particular craft or class and iii certification of the systemwide representative organization if any for each of our craft or class following the merger failure to resolve these disputes could result in delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration as well as adversely impact our operations and costs 

pending operational integration of virgin america with alaska it will be necessary to maintain a “fence” between alaska and virgin america employee groups that are represented by unions during this time we will keep the employee groups separate each applying the terms of its own existing employment agreements unless other terms have been negotiated achievement of expected synergies and other benefits will be delayed until the time that operational integration is obtained 

we are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition and the integration of virgin america’s business 

we are expected to incur substantial integration and transition expenses in connection with the acquisition of virgin america including the necessary costs associated with integrating the operations of alaska and virgin america there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including reservations frequent flyer ticketingdistribution maintenance and flight operations while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the financial benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition including the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration expenses likely will continue to result in us taking significant charges against earnings in future periods and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

we acquired virgin america’s indebtedness upon closing of the acquisition which additional indebtedness may limit our financial and operating flexibility 

upon closing of the acquisition we acquired virgin america’s outstanding indebtedness and became subject to the operating restrictions under the debt instruments governing such indebtedness virgin america has significant debt and lease obligations related to existing purchased and leased aircraft our increased indebtedness following the acquisition may 

 

 

we will need to launch certain branding or rebranding initiatives in connection with the acquisition that may take a significant amount of time and involve substantial costs and that may not be favorably received by our guests 

we may incur substantial costs if we decide to rebrand any of virgin america’s products and services and may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by virgin america in any of virgin america’s markets the failure of any such rebranding initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain guests which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits contemplated to result from the acquisition 

 25 

our ability to use virgin america’s net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal and state income tax purposes may be limited as a result of the previous ownership changes this acquisition or taxable income if it does not reach sufficient levels 

as of the acquisition closing date virgin america had federal net operating loss carryforwards “nols” of approximately  773 million  available to offset future taxable income expiring between 2028  and 2036  and state nols of approximately  344 million  that expire beginning in 2027  and continuing through 2035  

virgin america has experienced multiple “ownership changes” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” the most recent being its acquisition by us section 382 of the code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of preownership change nols of the corporation that experiences ownership change the limitation imposed by section 382 of the code for any postownership change year generally would be determined by multiplying the value of such corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains or reduced by builtin losses in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change our use of nols generated after the date of an ownership change would not be limited unless we were to experience a subsequent ownership change 

our ability to use the nols will also depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods the nols may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the nols 

the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results 

in accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the virgin america acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually we could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties we can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results

year in review 

on december 14 2016 we completed our acquisition of virgin america becoming the fifth largest us airline the combined company now offers nearly 1200  daily flights to 118  destinations across the united states mexico canada costa rica and cuba with more nonstop destinations from the west coast than any other airline by combining loyalty programs and networks along with our awardwinning customer service and the expansion of our international partner portfolio we believe we will provide greater benefits for our guests and become known as the premier airline for people on the west coast 

in 2016  we posted our thirteenth  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis which is a testament to the hard work of our people and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives our 2016  pretax income as reported was 13 billion  an increase of 3  over 2015  our 2016  pretax income on an adjusted basis a nongaap financial measure was 14 billion  an increase  of 8  over 2015  the adjusted pretax income reflects the exclusion of 117 million  of mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america and 13 million  of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments 

the improvement in adjusted pretax income was driven by an increase of 333 million  in revenues and a decrease of  123 million  in fuel costs these benefits were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding fuel and special items of 320 million  or 10  to support the increased capacity of 11  this increase reflects the addition of virgin america capacity from the acquisition date through december 31 2016 

the growth in revenues of 333 million  was driven by the growth in our business and the inclusion of virgin america in our results for the period from december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 on a combined basis we launched 17  new markets in 2016 and in january 2017 we launched historic flights to havana cuba from los angeles on the regional side of our business we anticipate the delivery of horizons embraer e175 regional jet this spring—the first of an order of 33 placed in early 2016 our network is rapidly expanding with these regional aircraft and the recent acquisition of virgin america we believe we have a strong future ahead of us and look forward to the many new opportunities our combined networks will bring our company

shareholder return 

in 2016  we paid cash dividends of 136 million  and repurchased approximately 3 million  shares of our common stock for 193 million  under the 1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in the second quarter of 2016  we paused our share repurchases in advance of the acquisition of virgin america since 2007 we have repurchased 59 million  shares of common stock for 15 billion  for an average price of approximately 2590  per share in 2016  we increased our quarterly dividend 38 from 020 per share to 0275  per share and subsequent to december 31 2016  we announced a 9  increase to 030  per share overall we returned 329 million  to shareholders during 2016  we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2017  primarily in the form of dividends 

outlook 

  

we completed the acquisition of virgin america on december 14 2016 positioning us as the fifth largest airline in the us with an unparalleled ability to serve west coast travelers the acquisition of virgin america provides a platform for growth of our lowfare premium product a powerful west coast network for our guests and enhanced international partnerships additionally virgin america provides access to constrained gates particularly on the east coast creating increased utility for our guests 

 34 

in 2017 and beyond we are focused on the successful integration of virgin america with alaska air group while continuing to work towards obtaining a single operating certificate soc we currently expect to receive an soc in early 2018 our priority throughout the integration process is to run two great airlines and maintain a safe and compliant operation while providing a great experience for our guests additionally we are particularly focused on merging the cultures and brands that have made alaska and virgin america respected and trusted over the years by our guests we intend to minimize any disruption to our guests during our integration efforts by being transparent about the progress we are making and how the changes may affect them employee engagement throughout the integration will remain a top priority as well ensuring that employees remain engaged informed and excited about the new alaska air group we plan to bring our teams together through workshops and trainings delivered throughout 2017 additionally we will remain focused on capturing the value and synergies created by combining these two great companies 

in addition to our integration with virgin america one of our biggest initiatives is the launch of our new premium class service on our b737 aircraft which provides greater leg room priority boarding and complimentary cocktails among other benefits premium class was rolled out in early january 2017 and so far the results are exceeding our expectations in both guest response and revenue generation 

currently we expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2017  by approximately 85  the growth rate compares 2017 systemwide capacity with historical air group and virgin america combined capacity in 2016 this compares to a 102  combined growth in 2016  on the same basis current schedules indicate competitive capacity will be 5 points higher in the first quarter of 2017  we believe that our product our operation our engaged employees our awardwinning service and our competitive mileage plan™ and elevate® programs combined with our strong balance sheet give us the ability to compete vigorously in our markets

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

2016  compared with 2015   

our consolidated net income for 2016  was 814 million  or 654  per diluted share compared to net income of 848 million  or 656  per diluted share in 2015  our financial results include results of virgin america for the period from december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of december 14 2016 refer to the critical accounting estimates section for further information regarding purchase accounting 

excluding the impact of mergerrelated costs marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and other special items our adjusted consolidated net income for 2016  was 911 million  or 732  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 842 million  or 651  per share in 2015  the following tables reconcile our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share eps during the full year 2016  and 2015  to amounts as reported in accordance with gaap

operating statistics summary unaudited 

alaska air group inc 

below are operating statistics we use to measure performance consolidated and mainline amounts presented below include virgin america data for the period december 14 2016 through december 31 2016 we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which is a nongaap measure 





 38 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   333 million  or 6  during 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue — mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2016   increased  by 4  due to a 99   increase  in capacity partially offset by a 54   decrease  in prasm compared to 2015  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes and growth in our operating fleet virgin america capacity from the acquisition date through december 31 2016 represented approximately 2 points  of capacity increase from 2015 the decrease in prasm was driven by a decrease  of 57  in ticket yield due to competitive pressures and our own growth offset by a slight increase in load factor furthermore the decline in fuel prices over the last year has contributed to lower ticket prices 

we expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2017  however given our projected capacity growth we expect total passenger revenue will increase from 2016  on a combined comparative basis that includes full 2016 capacity of virgin america 

  

passenger revenue — regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 54 million  or 6  compared to 2015  due to a 165   increase  in capacity partially offset by an 87   decrease  in prasm compared to 2015  the increase in capacity is due to an increase in departures from new e175 deliveries an increase in average aircraft stage length and the annualization of new routes introduced over the past twelve months the decrease  in prasm was due to a 74   decrease  in ticket yield as well as a decrease  in load factor of 11 point s the decrease in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as we strengthen our network utility in the pacific northwest as well as an increase in the average trip length of our regional flights 

we expect regional passenger revenue to increase in 2017  primarily due to the delivery and placement into service of 18  e175s and the annualization of new routes introduced in 2016 

other — net 

other—net revenue increased   120 million  or 17  from 2015  primarily due to increases in mileage plan™ revenue mileage plan™ revenue increased 100 million  or 30  due to increased miles sold and improved compensation terms with our mileage plan™ affinity credit card partner as a result of a contract extension which became effective january 1 2016 additionally mileage plan™ revenue earned from our partner airlines increased as compared to the prior year 

we expect our other—net revenue to experience an increase on a year over year basis at a pace higher than the expected increase in passengers in 2017  due to growth in the mileage plan™ program as we introduce virgin america elevate® members to the program as well as continued organic growth amongst new and existing customers 

 39 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   282 million  or 7  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and 117 million  of mergerrelated costs partially offset by lower fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2015  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2016  by 128 million  or 10  compared to 2015  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   8  on a 65  increase in ftes the increase in wages was primarily attributable to fte growth to support expansion of our business and an increase in the average wages per employee 

medical and other benefits increased   25  compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and highcost medical claims 

defined contribution plans increased   12  due to fte growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups 

pension expense decreased   11  compared to the same period in the prior year the decrease is due to a change in several assumptions used at december 31 2015 including a higher discount rate updated retirement age assumptions future salary increase assumptions and others that resulted in lower expense recognition in 2016 

we expect wages and benefits to be 30  to 35  higher in 2017  compared to 2016  the impact of virgin america is approximately three quarters  of the increase the remainder is the expected growth in ftes to support our capacity growth along with higher wages pension costs and medical costs 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  to 127 million  in 2016  from 120 million  in 2015  the increase is due to a higher wage base 

 40 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below and the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases aircraft fuel expense can be volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense decreased   123 million  or 13  compared to 2015  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 91  on our consolidated 106  increase in capacity partially offset by a 14  improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by consolidated asms per gallon 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 19  as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by the price of crude oil and the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2016  was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 11  and a decrease in refining margins of 36  when compared to the prior year 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from or pay to hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 16 million  in 2016  compared to losses of 19 million  in 2015  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement 

as of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to increase approximately 39  in the first quarter of 2017  as compared to the first quarter of 2016  of air group as reported due to higher crude oil prices and refining margins as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased  by 17 million  or 7  compared to the prior year maintenance costs increased  primarily due to more engine and airframe events than in 2016 additionally in the prior year we received vendor credits which offset expense for engine maintenance that had been previously completed on the b737 fleet 

we expect aircraft maintenance to be approximately 50  to 55  higher in 2017  compared to 2016 the impact of virgin america represents approximately three quarters  of the increase for alaska we expect an increase in engine maintenance costs primarily for our 737800 aircraft as we anticipate entering into a powerbythehour maintenance arrangement 

 41 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense increased  by 9 million  or 9  compared to the prior year primarily due the addition of the rent expense on the 53 airbus aircraft leased by virgin america for the period from december 14 2016 to december 31 2016 

we expect aircraft rent to be approximately 140  to 145  higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the fullyear impact of the 53 leased airbus aircraft partially offset by a reduction in the number of leased b737400 aircraft 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased 24 million  or 8  primarily due to increased flying in 2016  as we increased capacity and entered new markets 

we expect landing fees and other rental expenses to increase approximately 50  to 55  in 2017  with virgin america representing about three quarters  of the increase the remainder of the increase relates to our expected capacity growth and rate increases at airports across our network 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   33 million  or 15  when compared to 2015  the increase is primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us additionally wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due in part to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve we also had several information technology and facilities projects that required contracted support 

we expect contracted services to be 50  to 55  higher in 2017  compared to 2016 primarily due to the addition of virgin america as well as the additional contracted services to be incurred as the companies are integrated 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 14 million  or 7  compared to 2015  mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities as well as new sponsorships which became effective in the current year 

we expect selling expense to increase approximately 65  to 70  in 2017  compared to 2016 primarily due to the addition of virgin america 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 43 million  or 13  compared to 2015  the increase is primarily due to the addition of 19  900ers to our fleet since december 31 2015  partially offset by a change in the estimated useful lives of certain b737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years which was effective october 1 2016 

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to remain relatively flat  in 2017 compared to 2016 the impact of virgin america and newly delivered aircraft in 2017 is expected to be offset by a full year impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives mentioned previously 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased  by 13 million  or 12  due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu offering higher quality food and beverage products 

we expect food and beverage expenses to increase 40  to 45  in 2017  primarily due to the acquisition of virgin america 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements increased   23 million  or 32  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase is primarily due to the significant increase in regional capacity in 2016 through the introduction of e175 flying 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to increase in 2017  as we continue to expand our regional network 

 42 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   9 million  or 3  compared to 2015  the increase is primarily due to increases in property and other taxes personnel costs for our flight crews and an increase in fines and penalties 

we expect other operating expenses to increase approximately 50  to 55  in 2017  compared to 2016 the impact of virgin america represents approximately half  of the increase while the other half is driven by it and facilitiesrelated projects 

special items—mergerrelated costs and other 

we recorded special items of 117 million  for mergerrelated costs associated with our acquisition of virgin america these costs consisted primarily of legal expenses investment banking fees and severance costs we expect to continue to incur mergerrelated costs in 2017 our 2015 special items of 32 million  consisted of a noncash pension settlement expense and costs related to ongoing litigation 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2016  we recorded nonoperating expense of 4 million  compared to nonoperating income of 14 million  in 2015  in the current year we incurred more interest expense associated with the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of virgin america this expense was partially offset by additional interest income earned during the period we held those funds in advance of the acquisition close date 

  

additional segment information 

refer to note 13  of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

mainline 

pretax profit for mainline was 13 billion  in 2016  compared to 12 billion  in 2015  this segment includes financial results of virgin america from the date of acquisition through december 31 2016 the 135 million  increase is due to an increase in operating revenues of 277 million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of 126 million  revenue growth was primarily driven by the 159 million  increase in passenger revenues and the 100 million  increase in mileage plan™ revenue both described previously growth in operating expenses was due to higher wages to support our network growth higher ramp and passenger handling due to increased flying and higher wage rates at stations where we use vendors to assist us higher depreciation related to our fleet growth and higher selling expenses related to increased advertising economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency slightly offset by an 8  increase in consumption 

regional 

pretax profit for regional was 93 million  in 2016  compared to 105 million  in 2015  the 12 million  decrease in pretax profit was driven by a 74 million increase in nonfuel operating expenses in the current year to support additional departures partially offset by a 56 million increase in revenue and an 6 million decrease in fuel expense when compared to the prior year period 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 14 million  in 2016  compared to 28 million  in 2015  cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and are eliminated in consolidation increased due to additional capacity added in the last 12 months the 32 million increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was largely driven by higher medical costs due to an increased number of large medical claims increased volume of engine overhaul and heavy airframe work employee signing bonuses and overhead restructuring costs 

 43 

2015  compared with 2014 

our consolidated net income for 2015  was 848 million  or 656  per diluted share compared to net income of 605 million  or 442  per diluted share in 2014  

excluding the impact of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and special items our adjusted consolidated net income for 2015  was 842 million  or 651  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 571 million  or 418  per share in 2014

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   230 million  or 4  during 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue—mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2015   increased  by 4  on a 107  increase in capacity partially offset by a 58  decrease in prasm compared to 2014  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes larger aircraft added to our fleet and increased utilization of our aircraft the decrease in prasm was driven by a 44  decrease in ticket yield combined with a 12point  decrease in load factor compared to the prior year the decline in ticket yield was primarily due to increased competitive capacity in the markets we serve and our own growth yield was further impacted by a significant decline in fuel prices which has a direct impact on ticket pricing the decline in load factor was also a result of increased capacity 

passenger revenue—regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 49 million  or 6  compared to 2014  due to a 97  increase in capacity partially offset by a 34  decrease in prasm compared to 2014  the increase in capacity was due to an increase in departures and average aircraft stage length the decrease in prasm was due to a 38  decrease in ticket yield partially offset by an increase in load factor of 03 point s the decline in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as we strengthen our network utility in the pacific northwest 

  

other—net 

other — net revenue increased   22 million  or 3  from 2014  due to increases in mileage plan™ revenue and food and beverage sales partially offset by lower bag fee revenues mileage plan™ revenue increased 34 million or 12 due to increased miles sold food and beverage sales were higher due to the 89 increase in passengers and selling more premium offerings such as tom douglas signature meals bag fee revenue was lower due to promotions launched in 2015 to offer a free first checked bag to our alaska airlines signature visa credit card holders this decline was partially offset by incremental revenue from our affinity card bank partner 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses decreased 106 million  or 2  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of lower fuel costs 

significant operating expense variances from 2014  are more fully described below 

 45 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2015  by 118 million  or 10  compared to 2014  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   10  primarily due to an 88  increase in ftes and the annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates the increase in ftes was to support the growth in our business 

defined contribution plan expense increased 13  due to increased contributions throughout all labor groups and an increased matched percentage as a part of recent labor contracts 

pension expense increased 19 million compared to the same period in the prior year the increase is due to higher amortization of actuarial losses from previous years due primarily to a lower discount rate used to value the pension obligation at december 31 2014 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased to 120 million  in 2015 from 116 million  in 2014 the increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial performance more so than in the prior year coupled with a higher wage base 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense decreased   464 million  or 33  compared to 2014  the elements of the change are summarized in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 83  in line with the 106 increase capacity partially offset by a 22 improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by asms per gallon 

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 385 as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2015 was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 48 and a decrease in refining margins of 11 when compared to the prior year 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 19 million  in 2015  compared to losses of 41 million  in 2014  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement the 

 46 

decrease in losses on settled hedges was primarily due to our increased use of out of the money call options as well as purchasing shorterdated options both of which reduce the premium cost we pay 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance increased  by 24 million  or 10  compared to the prior year maintenance costs increased due to more scheduled engine maintenance events that were more expensive due to replacing lifelimited parts and heavier airframe checks 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   17 million  or 6  primarily due to increased flying in 2015 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased by 12 million  or 6  compared to 2014 mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in seattle and increased credit card commissions from higher revenue 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   18 million  or 9  when compared to 2014 the increase is primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us with passenger and ramp handling 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 26 million  or 9  due to the increased number of aircraft in our fleet and cabin upgrades throughout 2014 and 2015 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased by 20 million  or 22  due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu offering higher quality food and beverage products 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpas increased   14 million  or 24  in 2015  compared to 2014 the increase is primarily due to the five e175 aircraft operated by skywest added to our regional operation in 2015 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   48 million  or 16  compared to 2014  the increase is primarily due to professional services with regard to our brand refresh and network strategy personnel costs for our flight crews and itrelated costs 

special items 

during 2015 we recorded special items of 32 million  this is due to a 14 million noncash pension settlement expense recorded as a result of lumpsum payments made to terminated vested participants which removed them from participation in the pension plan therefore reducing our outstanding liability and an 18 million expense related to ongoing litigation 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2015  we recorded nonoperating income of 14 million  compared to an expense of 13 million  in 2014  in 2015 we capitalized more of our interest expense on an increasing balance of prepaid aircraft deposits 

additional segment information 

refer to note 13  of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

 47 

mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 12 billion  in 2015  compared to 834 million  in 2014  the 372 million  increase is due to increased revenues of 188 million  and decreased operating expenses of 192 million  slightly offset by a decrease in nonoperating income of 8 million  revenue growth was largely driven by the 165 million  increase in mainline passenger revenue described previously growth in operating expenses was due to higher wages to support our growth higher ramp and passenger handling associated with increased flying higher depreciation related to our fleet growth and increased food and beverage costs economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency slightly offset by an increase in consumption 

regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 105 million  in 2015  compared to 74 million  in 2014  the 31 million  increase is due to increased revenues of 43 million  offset by increased operating expense of 13 million  revenue growth was driven by increased passenger revenue operating expenses were higher in 2015  to support additional departures 

  

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 28 million  in 2015  compared to 17 million  in 2014  the 11 million  increase is due to increased cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation of 36 million  offset by increased nonfuel operating expenses of 26 million  the increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was largely driven by increased engine maintenance and other expenses to support the increase in capacity 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

on december 14 2016  we completed the acquisition of virgin america paying 26 billion  to stockholders and other equity holders of virgin america we funded the acquisition with cash on hand and approximately 20 billion  of secured debt financing provided by multiple lenders approximately 16 billion  of the loans obtained to fund the acquisition are secured by a total of 56  of air groups aircraft including 37  b737900er aircraft and 19  b737800 aircraft the remainder is secured by air groups interest in certain aircraft purchase agreements as a result we have fewer unencumbered aircraft in our operating fleet than in prior periods which could affect our ability to obtain future financing 

in 2016  we took delivery of 19  b737900er aircraft and made debt payments totaling 249 million  we also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling 136 million  and repurchasing 193 million  of our common stock because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance we are one of only three airlines in the us with investment grade credit ratings 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

 48 



   

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 14 billion  in 2016  compared to 16 billion  in 2015  the decrease of 198 million  is due to a decline in operating results primarily driven by an increase in nonfuel operating expenses—including  117 million  in mergerrelated costs associated with the acquisition of virgin america—partially offset by higher revenues and lower fuel costs 

in 2015 we generated 16 billion in operating cash flows compared to 10 billion in 2014 the increase of 554 million was primarily attributable to improved operating results driven largely by lower jet fuel costs 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment to make debt payments and to return capital to shareholders during 2016 we paused our share repurchase program as we prepared for the acquisition of virgin america 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 26 billion  during 2016  compared to 930 million  in 2015  we used 20 billion  to acquire virgin america representing 26 billion consideration paid offset by  645 million  of cash acquired our capital expenditures were 678 million  or 153 million  lower than in 2015  as a result of fewer aircraft purchase deposits made during 2016 as compared to 2015 during 2016 we took delivery of 19  b737900ers and made advance purchase deposits on b737 and e175 aircraft that will be delivered over the next 24 months this compares to the delivery of 11  b737900ers and one q400 in the prior year 

as of december 31 2016  we had firm commitments for 54  b737 aircraft through 2023  with options to acquire up to 41  additional b737 nextgen aircraft and max aircraft in 2019  through 2024  we have lease commitments for 10  a321neo aircraft with deliveries in 2017 through 2018 and an order for 30  a320neos with deliveries starting in 2020 through 2022 this order is cancelable with the forfeiture of 15 million  of predelivery payments we have firm commitments to purchase or lease 38  e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2017 through 2019 and options to acquire 30  e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2019 to 2021 and lease an additional 8 with deliveries in 2019 the options for all fleet types give us the flexibility but not the obligation to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met 

the table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised as of february 28 2017 additional options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met 

 49 



 

cash used in investing activities was 930 million  during 2015 compared to 541 million  in 2014 our capital expenditures were 831 million  in 2015 137 million higher than in 2014 

cash provided by financing activities 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 15 billion  during 2016  compared to cash used of 688 million  in 2015  during the year we secured debt proceeds of 2 billion  for the acquisition of virgin america made debt payments of 249 million  repurchased 193 million  of our common stock and paid cash dividends of 136 million  in 2015  we made debt payments of 116 million  stock repurchases of 505 million  and cash dividend payments of 102 million  in 2014 we made debt payments of 119 million  and stock repurchases of 348 million  partially offset by proceeds from debt of 51 million 

  

we plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand internally generated cash from operations along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lines of credit 

  

we have two 100 million  credit facilities and a 52 million  credit facility we have secured letters of credit against the 52 million  facility but have no plans to borrow using either of two  remaining facilities information about these facilities can be found in note 6  to consolidated financial statements 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had firm orders to purchase or lease 102  aircraft we also have an order for 30  airbus a320neo with deliveries from 2020 through 2022 with an option to cancel up to three years in advance of delivery in groups of five aircraft we could incur a loss of predelivery payments and credits as a cancellation fee we also have options to acquire 41  b737 aircraft with deliveries from 2019 through 2024 and 30  e175 aircraft with deliveries from 2019 through 2021 in addition to the 15  e175 aircraft currently operated by skywest in our regional fleet we have options in future periods to add regional capacity by having skywest operate up to 8 more e175 aircraft 

the following table summarizes our projected fleet count by year as of february 28 2017  





 50 

 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 



contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2016  



 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 197 million  at december 31 2016  compared to a 161 million  unfunded position at december 31 2015  this results in a 90  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 92  funded as of december 31 2015  

 51 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements 

  

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets as measured by value are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices usage of net operating losses whether bonus depreciation provisions are available as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2016  we made tax payments net of refunds totaling 459 million  and had an effective tax rate of 395  we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 37 to 38 for 2017 and the effective rate of cash paid for income taxes to be in the range of 20 to 25 of book income although these estimates are subject to change we believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

frequent flyer programs 

  

alaskas mileage plan™ loyalty program awards miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners we also sell services including miles for transportation to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a major bank that offers alaska affinity credit cards in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

virgin americas elevate® program allows guests to earn points for purchasing travel that are redeemable for travel awards throughout our network and the networks of virgin americas airline partners a liability for all points outstanding as of december 14 2016 was recorded at the estimated fair value as part of our acquisition of virgin america the fair value was estimated using the estimated ticket value of points expected to be redeemed as of the date of the acquisition see business combination accounting goodwill and intangibles discussion below for estimates used for purchase accounting 

for miles earned by guests who fly on us or our airline partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future for services sold through one of our nonairline partners the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other—net revenue in the period the services are performed commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 

 52 

2016  2015  and 2014  was 329 million  280 million  and 261 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when the award travel occurs or the miles expire and as other — net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2016  we had approximately 1865 billion  miles and points outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 11 billion  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan™ are described below 

   

we use the relative selling price method for the deferral of sales proceeds for contracts that were modified after the effective date of accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 200913 we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables this relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables a 1 shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately 8 million  

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan™ mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage considers historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors based on statistical analysis of historical data our current breakage rate is 174 a hypothetical 1 change in our estimate of breakage has approximately an 8 million  effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan™ program and historical award redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the guest travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the guest the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that guest we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan™ assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

 53 

pension plans 

  

our actuarial estimates of pension liability the related expense and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in note 8  to the consolidated financial statements 

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of key assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rates to be used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and the interest and service cost changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate used for the obligation increases we discounted future pension obligations using rates between 429  and 450  at december 31 2016  and between 455  and 469  at december 31 2015  the discount rates were determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from each of the four  definedbenefit pension plans the discount rates we use are based on a yield curve that uses a pool of higheryielding bonds estimated to be more in line with settlement rates as we have taken steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future if the discount rate decreased by 05  our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2016  would increase by approximately 132 million  and our estimated 2017  pension expense would increase by approximately 8 million  

pension liability and future pension expense can increase or decrease as assumptions in the actuarial data changes for example in 2015 we engaged our thirdparty actuary to update demographic assumptions used in the valuation of the definedbenefit pension liabilities these assumptions included updates such as estimated salary increases employee turnover and retirement rates among other items the changes in these assumptions decreased our projected benefit obligation by approximately 50 million at december 31 2015 the primary cause of the decline was the change in expected participant retirement rates the study found that eligible employees are retiring later than they had in our previous assumption update resulting in lower expected cash flows post retirement 

pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2016  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate longterm rates of return between 550  and 600  which compares to 60  and 650  at december 31 2015  we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2016  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities us fixedincome securities and real estate a decrease in the expected longterm rate of return of 05  would increase our estimated 2017  pension expense by approximately 9 million  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans were frozen january 1 2014 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 57 billion  of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate effective october 1 2016 we changed our estimate of useful lives for certain b737 aircraft from 20 years to 25 years to better align with their operational performance maintenance experience and industry practice factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft 

 54 

business combination accounting goodwill and intangibles 

to record the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of our acquisition of virgin america on december 14 2016 we have performed a purchase price allocation utilizing the best information available to management the purchase price allocation is provisional and is subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any adjustments to the purchase price allocation to be made as soon as practicable but no later than december 14 2017 the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using market income or cost methods our consolidated balance sheet reflects goodwill in the amount of  19 billion  at december 31 2016  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of virgin america’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities identifiable intangible assets recorded totaled approximately  143 million  at december 31 2016  and consisted of customer relationships airport slots and gates with the exception of airport slots all of the identified intangible assets are finitelived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 

our impairment analysis may include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount we will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value 

qualitative factors that might indicate a need to perform an impairment analysis outside of the regular annual assessment could include but are not limited to 1 reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions 2 significantly ongoing higher prices for jet fuel 3 significant ongoing lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand 4 a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments and 5 significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities actual or threatened war labor actions by employees or further industry regulation 

our business combination accounting as well as future impairment analyses require management to make assumptions and apply judgment key assumptions include but are not limited to estimating future cash flows selecting discount rates and selecting valuation methodologies these estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations may be affected by changes in economic condition our economic performance or business strategies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 change in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2016  would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 45 million  or 7 million  respectively 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 20  million at december 31 2016  compared to a portfolio value of 4 million  at december 31 2015  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2016  

  

 55 

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 4  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates in order to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have a number of interest rate swaps that fix the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements our exposure to interest rate variability is further mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on average variablerate debt held during 2016  would have correspondingly changed our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 2 million our variablerate debt is approximately 61  and 24  of our total longterm debt as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively 

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2016  interest income would increase by approximately 15 million

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso framework managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 excluded internal control over financial reporting related to virgin america acquired december 14 2016 which represented approximately 33 of consolidated total assets and 2 of consolidated operating revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  based on our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2016  

  

we intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our controls and procedures

as we look to the future we will build on the success of the past few years by executing our strategic plan — the five focus areas 

safety and compliance 

we have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives alaska and horizon are awaiting final faa certification of our fullyimplemented safety management system sms sms helps identify and manage risk and builds a sustainable culture of safety for every air group employee once again for 2015 100 of our alaska and horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the faas diamond certificate of excellence award this is the 14th consecutive year alaska airlines has received the award and the 14th time in the last 16 years for horizon in 2014 we launched ready safe go  a safety campaign designed to increase safety awareness across the air group system with our ready safe go program in its second year employee 

 4 

awareness of their individual contributions to a strong culture of safety continues to increase in 2015 alaska and horizon employees made a “personal commitment to safety” during facilitated discussions with company leaders 

people focus 

our success depends on our employees higher employee engagement drives higher productivity superior execution and better customer service which is why we listen to our employees for feedback in shaping our strategy employee engagement scores from our annual employee survey are at historical highs in addition to the beyond service training for our customerfacing employees all of air groups leaders participated in a multiday leadership training called gear up 2 this is the second phase of our awardwinning leadership training where our leaders spent time focusing on several of our core leadership principles in an effort to give them the tools they need to effectively lead a highlyengaged workforce 

we understand that aligning our employees goals with the companys goals is important in achieving success all employees participate in our performancebased pay pbp and operational performance rewards opr programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety profitability ontime performance low costs and customer satisfaction over the last five years our incentive programs have paid out on average over 86 of annual pay or more than one months pay for most employees this is consistent with one of our guiding principles that we want to pay our people well with a goal of reaching the industry’s best productivity over time to that end we are currently in longterm agreements with all of our major work groups which provide the company employees and investors with longterm stability 

hasslefree customer experience 

we want to be the easiest airline to fly in each step of the customers journey from booking a ticket to checkin from flying in our aircraft to claiming baggage at the final destination we want to provide a hasslefree experience for our customers our industryleading ontime performance for the past six years reflects the reliable service we provide our customers and we were the first airline to guarantee checked baggage delivery to the carousel within 20 minutes customers can tag their own bags at airport kiosks or from their homes and we have fingerprint scan entry to our airport lounges we lead the travel industry in mobile innovation with a 5star rated iphone app and android and microsoft apps that allow passengers to purchase tickets checkin upgrade seats and reserve food for the flight  all with helpful notifications that inform customers when there are changes to their flights the transportation security administration tsa precheck program is available in 60 of our locations which allows eligible customers to optin for reduced screening requirements to hear directly from our customers we have the alaska listens survey with five simple questions designed to get timely feedback  and we guarantee a response within 72 hours if there is an issue that needs to be resolved as passengers take more control of their travel experience we are able to reduce the time it takes a customer to move from the airport curb to the aircraft 

energetic and compelling brand 

we want to be recognized as the preferred airline to fly in january 2016 we introduced a bold new brand expression including an updated identity livery and look and feel for our digital and physical experiences we believe there’s an opportunity to deepen the emotional connection with our customers as we continue to expand and grow our updated brand expression draws upon our rich heritage while infusing it with additional warmth and energy  to better reflect how customers feel about our brand and the great service that we pride ourselves in delivering 

we continue to invest in a better customer experience onboard customers will continue to enjoy more of what they love with free and premium entertainment direct to their devices pacific northwestinspired food and beverages and custom leather seats with power outlets for laptops and personal devices and larger overhead bins for carryon bags in the fall of 2016 we will introduce a new premium class section in the main cabin with increased pitch and other amenities 

we also continue to invest in advertising across markets we recently renewed our partnership with seattle seahawks quarterback russell wilson as our chief football officer we also announced a tenyear sponsorship with the university of washington which includes naming rights to the alaska airlines field at husky stadium and the alaska airlines arena at hec edmunson pavillion among other benefits 

low fares low costs and network growth 

we believe that in order to provide low fares for customers in a growing network of destinations while returning value to our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure in 2015  we lowered our unit costs excluding fuel by 07  on a consolidated basis representing the sixth consecutive year of annual reduction we achieved this through a continued focus on productivity cost management and network growth we increased employee productivity in 2015  and will continue to focus on that metric as we leverage growth we also manage fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 56  over the last five years additionally we have added splitscimitar winglets to 94 aircraft which are expected to increase fuel efficiency by 

 5 

approximately 15 per aircraft looking forward we have committed to purchasing 31  737900er and 37  737max aircraft with deliveries from 2016  to 2022  and two  q400 aircraft with deliveries in 2018  although these are subject to change in addition we will increase regional capacity by adding 18  e175s with contractual deliveries from 2016  to 2017  and we may order an additional 30 regional jets with delivery beginning in 2017 if we reach acceptable commercial terms these aircraft deliveries position us for growth and help to ensure that we will continue to operate the most fuelefficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future 

in 2015  we added 20 new markets to our route structure we continued to strengthen our seattle network to offer further utility to our customers by offering nonstop flights to markets like new york jfk charleston raleighdurham nashville oklahoma city and milwaukee we also added flying from los angeles lax to liberia and san jose costa rica and baltimore we have grown capacity over 7 annually on average for the past 20 years and we plan to continue to grow between 4 and 8 annually in the next several years for 2016  we plan to grow capacity approximately 8 

air group 

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of alaska airlines and horizon air although alaska and horizon both operate as airlines their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 horizon was acquired by air group in 1986 alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets mainline and contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity such that alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers the percentage of revenues by category is as follows 



we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in ways that best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce our seasonality 

the percentage of our capacity by region is as follows 



mainline 

we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada mexico and costa rica as well as passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2015  we carried 23 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations at december 31 2015  alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 147  boeing 737 jet aircraft compared to 137  b737 aircraft as of december 31 2014  

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



regional 

  

our regional operations consist of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2015  our regional operations carried approximately 9 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and carries about 85 of air groups regional revenue passengers 

based on 2015  passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our leading airports are seattle and portland at december 31 2015  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 52  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under alaskas designator code in airline reservation systems and in customerfacing locations the regional fleet operated by skywest consisted of eight  crj 700 aircraft and five  e175 aircraft 

the percentage of regional passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below

the alaska airlines mileage plan™ program provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flier benefits miles can be earned by flying on alaska or on one of our 16  airline partners or by using the alaska airlines visa signature card or through other nonairline partners our extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with two of the three major global alliances oneworld and skyteam making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach preferred status in our mileage plan™ and have access to a large network of travel destinations further members can receive 25000 bonus miles 30000 beginning in the spring of 2016 upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and earn triple miles on purchases made on alaska airlines flights or on alaskaaircom alaska airlines visa signature cardholders also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for all parties in the same itinerary earned miles can be redeemed for flights on alaska airlines or on any of our partner airlines or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines for as low as 15000 miles all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value for their travel on alaska airlines which led to our mileage plan™ receiving the highest ranking by frequent fliers in the firstever jd power airline loyaltyrewards program satisfaction report in 2014 and again in 2015 

mileage plan™ revenues represent approximately 11 of air groups total revenues furthermore our mileage plan™ helps drive more revenue by attaining new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide the mileage plan™ provides more value per dollar spent on the alaska airlines visa signature card in comparison to other frequent flier programs in the industry summary of the benefits provided in comparison to some of our competitors are as follows 



expected launch of 30000 bonus miles in may 2016 currently bonus miles are 25000

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flier codeshare and interline agreements frequent flier agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our mileage plan™ members alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flier programs for our mileage plan™ members through our frequent flier partnerships with 16  domestic and international carriers 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flier codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to customers 

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flier and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

the comprehensive summary of alliances with other airlines is as follows 

 7 



 

the following is the financial impact of our marketing alliances 



other revenue 

other revenue consists of freight and mail revenue and ancillary revenue such as bag fees change fees onboard food and beverage and boardroom membership total other revenue excluding mileage plan™ revenue represents about 7 of our total revenues in recent years we have seen growth in our ancillary revenue as we expand services onboard such as tom douglas signature meals inflight entertainment and wifi although we do charge bag fees we offer a 20minute bag guarantee so that we deliver value to our customers through fast reliable service in 2015 we added a free bag as a permanent feature of our affinity credit card as we focus on ways to better serve our customers we expect our ancillary revenues will continue to grow 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive subject to various uncertainties and has historically been characterized by low profit margins uncertainties include general economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2015  the airline industry reported record revenues and profits as the global economy continued to recover and oil prices declined significantly as the industry strengthens airlines are now making significant investments in airports in new planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering thus the level of competition is expected to increase 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 22  to 35  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the us 

  

the average annual price of crude oil in the last five years has ranged from a low of 49  per barrel in 2015  from a high of 98  in 2013  for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 12 million  of fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 5 million  per year 

 8 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years average annual refining margin prices have fluctuated between 20  per barrel and 36  per barrel in the last five years and averaged 20  in 2015  

generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased   39  in 2015  decreased 6 in 2014  and 4 in 2013  

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



 

we use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices historically we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts but we discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in the third quarter of 2014 call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums currently we start hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet and horizon operates an allbombardier q400 turboprop fleet air groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 744  asmsg in 2011  to 786  asmsg in 2015  these improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport we compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes our largest competitor is delta air lines who has significantly increased their capacity in seattle over the past two years approximately 60 of our capacity to and from seattle competes with delta based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase more than 13 in the first half of 2016  weighted based on our network 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our customers 

  

   

 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance passenger amenities  including first class seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2015  alaska airlines ranked “highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers” by jd power and associates for the eighth  year in a row all of our 2015  mainline aircraft deliveries included the boeing sky interior our alaska beyond™ inflight experience which features our streaming inflight entertainment gourmet food designed by tom douglas and comfortable seats with additional space and power as part of our exceptional above and beyond flight experience in 2015  we introduced preferred plus seating and boeings new space bins tm  preferred plus gives customers the option to upgrade to bulkhead and exit row seats at checkin for a nominal fee and includes early boarding and a free cocktail space bins tm  provide space for up to 50 more carryon bags on board our aircraft providing a more hasslefree boarding experience for our passengers in 2016 we will be launching a premium class of service on our airplanes that will provide extra legroom early boarding premium snacks and complimentary alcoholic beverages 

 

the pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing approximately 85 of total seats accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields we will defend our core markets vigorously and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe the restructuring weve completed over the past decade has decreased our costs enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning appropriate returns for our shareholders 

 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flier opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our customers we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flier mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our customers access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our customers more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flier miles our mileage plan™ offers one of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 16  of our partner carriers 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

ticket distribution 

  

our tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have taken steps over the past few years to better manage the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations like hawaii and expanding to cities in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• changes in fuel costs 

  

   

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2015  we employed 15143   11614  at alaska and 3529  at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 41  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in both 2015  and 2014  

most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand at december 31 2015  labor unions represented 83  of alaska’s and 44  of horizon’s employees our relations with us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2015  were as follows 



horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2015  were as follows 



1  horizon pilots and flight attendants ratified new agreements subsequent to december 31 2015 the flight attendant agreement now becomes amendable in july 2019 and the pilot agreement becomes amendable in december 2024

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund amendments and reauthorization act and the oil pollution control act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

we expect there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions alaska and horizon have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements the insurance policies principally provide coverage for airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance war and allied perils and workers’ compensation in addition we currently carry a cyber liability policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprise wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterpriselevel identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

 

 

   

 

   

 

 

 

due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 12 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local level including increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment minimum wage requirements and health care mandates that could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs 

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers related to higher security costs increased costs related to updated infrastructures and other costs additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems and information technology infrastructure and services as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future especially since we rely on timely and effective thirdparty performance in conjunction with many of our technologyrelated initiatives 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

 13 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and socalled ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly on the west coast and in our seattle hub therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle los angeles anchorage portland and hawaii  a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2015  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 61  of our total passengers 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 14 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flier marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flier arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan™ program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline consolidation or reorganization could occur in the future we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements frequent flier program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs in 2016 we expect to migrate to a new crew management system we also plan to move our primary data center location disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs 

we accept store and transmit information about our customers our employees our business partners and our business in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

 15 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 

certain of our credit facilities and indentures governing our secured borrowings impose certain operating and financial covenants on us such covenants require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios and other negative covenants customary for such financings a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and we may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet 

as of december 31 2015  the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737800 900 900ers was approximately 64  years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 9  years our relatively new aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all customers 

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant improvements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs 

in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them the same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs including wage rate increases that ultimately flow through to us 

as of december 31 2015  labor unions represented approximately 83  of alaska’s and 44  of horizon’s employees although we have been successful in maturing communications negotiating approaches and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the companys longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in the companys strategic vision 

 16 

or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in recent years there have been pilot shortages in the regional market attrition beyond normal levels could negatively impact our operating results and our business prospects could be harmed

year in review 

the company had a record year in nearly every respect we posted our 12th  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis which is a testament to the hard work of our 15000 employees and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives our 2015  consolidated pretax income was a record 13 billion  a significant increase over the 975 million  in 2014  the 337 million  improvement was driven by an increase of 230 million  in revenues and a substantial decrease of  464 million  in our fuel expense partially offsetting these benefits was an increase in operating expenses excluding fuel and special items of 296 million  or 10  to support the increased capacity of 11  we recorded 32 million  of special charges in the current year related to a noncash pension expense associated with the buyout of the obligation for certain terminated vested plan participants and a litigationrelated matter 

the growth in revenues of 230 million  was driven by the growth in our business we launched 20 new markets in 2015 including 10 new cities such as charleston nashville raleighdurham milwaukee as well as san jose and liberia in costa rica we now have over 1000 departures daily across our network on peak days  a significant milestone for our airlines we are providing more utility than ever before in our primary hub of seattle giving our customers substantially more nonstop destinations out of seattle than any other carrier the significant decline in fuel expense this year was driven by declines in fuel prices while the increase in nonfuel operating expenses are primarily growthrelated increases as we increased our capacity 11

capital allocation 

in 2015  we repurchased 7208328  shares of our common stock for 505 million  under the share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors since 2007 we have repurchased 56 million  shares of common stock under such programs for 13 billion  for an average price of approximately 2366  per share in 2015  we increased our quarterly dividend 60 from 0125 per share to 020 per share and subsequent to december 31 2015  we announced a 38 increase to 0275 per share overall we returned 607 million  to shareholders during 2015  and expect to exceed that amount in 2016  

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run a safe compliant and reliable operation at our airlines in addition to our primary objective we remain focused on providing a hasslefree experience for our customers and building a compelling brand to support growing our network we recently enhanced our affinity credit card product offering and in 2016 we are introducing a new premium class of service on our airplanes our refreshed brand and bold new brand expressions will roll out throughout our major airports and on our airplanes in 2016 as well 

similar to the past several years we expect to continue our growth plans over the next year currently we expect to grow our systemwide capacity by approximately 8 in 2016 compared to 106  in 2015 over the past few years we have seen competitive capacity increase significantly in our markets especially in our hometown of seattle we expect to see even more competitive capacity in 2016 current schedules indicate competitive capacity will be 13 higher in the first quarter and 14 higher in the second quarter of 2016 we believe that our product our operation our engaged employees and awardwinning service combined with our strong balance sheet give us the ability to compete vigorously in our markets because of our strong financial position low costs and high number of unencumbered aircraft we have an ability to flex our fleet to meet demands and allocate capacity in the markets that meet our return objectives 

with our growth plans and the expectation for lower nonfuel unit costs and steady fuel costs for 2016 we believe our financial performance will continue to be strong

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   230 million  or 4  during 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2015   increased  by 4  on a 107   increase  in capacity partially offset by a 58   decrease  in prasm compared to 2014  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes larger aircraft added to our fleet and increased utilization of our aircraft the decrease  in prasm was driven by a 44   decrease  in ticket yield combined with a 12 point   decrease  in load factor compared to the prior year the decline in ticket yield was primarily due to increased competitive capacity in the markets we serve and our own growth furthermore the significant decline in fuel prices has had an impact on lower ticket prices the decline in load factor was also a result of increased capacity 

we expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2016  however we expect total passenger revenue will increase from 2015  although likely less than our growth rate in capacity 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 49 million  or 6  compared to 2014  due to a 97   increase  in capacity partially offset by a 34   decrease  in prasm compared to 2014  the increase in capacity is due to an increase in departures and average aircraft stage length the decrease  in prasm was due to a 38   decrease  in ticket yield partially offset by an increase  in load factor of 03 point s the decline in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as we strengthen our network utility in the pacific northwest 

we expect regional passenger revenue to increase in 2016  primarily due to the annualization of new routes introduced in 2015 and additional regional routes scheduled to be added in 2016 

other – net 

other—net revenue increased   22 million  or 3  from 2014  due to increases in mileage plan revenue and food and beverage sales partially offset by lower bag fee revenues mileage plan revenue increased 34 million  or 12  due to increased miles sold food and beverage sales were higher due to the 89  increase in passengers and selling more premium offerings such as tom douglas signature meals bag fee revenue was lower due to promotions launched in january to offer a free first checked bag to our mileage plan members and to all alaska airlines signature visa credit card holders beginning in february this decline was partially offset by incremental revenue from our affinity card bank partner 

we expect our other—net revenue to experience an increase at a pace higher than the expected increase in passengers in 2016  due primarily to the extended agreement with our affinity credit card bank partner effective january 1 2016 we expect this agreement will result in an incremental 60 million of revenue in 2016

total operating expenses decreased   106 million  or 2  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of lower fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



nm  not meaningful 

significant operating expense variances from 2014  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2015  by 118 million  or 10  compared to 2014  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   10  primarily due to an 88  increase in ftes and the annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates the increase in ftes was to support the growth in our business 

defined contribution plans increased   13  due to increased contributions throughout all labor groups and an increased matched percentage as a part of recent labor contracts 

pension expense increased   19 million  compared to the same period in the prior year the increase is due to higher amortization of actuarial losses from previous years due primarily to a lower discount rate used to value the pension obligation at december 31 2014  

we expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2016  compared to 2015  on a 4 to 5 increase in ftes 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  to 120 million  in 2015  from 116 million  in 2014  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial performance more so than in the prior year coupled with a higher wage base

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases aircraft fuel expense can be volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense decreased   464 million  or 33  compared to 2014  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 83  in line with the 106  increase in capacity partially offset by a 22  improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by asms per gallon 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 385  as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2015  was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 48  and a decrease in refining margins of 11  when compared to the prior year 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from or pay to hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 19 million  in 2015  compared to losses of 41 million  in 2014  these amounts represent cash paid for premium expense offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement the decrease in losses on settled hedges is primarily due to our increased use of out of the money call options as well as purchasing shorterdated options both of which reduce the premium cost we pay 

we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 37  lower in the first quarter of 2016  than the first  quarter of 2015  due to lower west coast jet fuel prices and the decrease in premium costs related to our fuel hedge program as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance costs increased  by 24 million  or 10  compared to the prior year maintenance costs increased  due to more scheduled engine maintenance events that were more expensive due to replacing lifelimited parts and heavier airframe checks 

 26 

we expect aircraft maintenance to be 5 to 8 higher in 2016  primarily due to the timing of maintenance events as our fleet ages and from lease return costs as we return 13 b737400 aircraft to lessors 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased 17 million  or 6  primarily due to increased flying in 2015  as we increased capacity and entered new markets 

we expect landing fees and other rental expenses to increase in 2016  in line with the expected capacity growth and higher rates at the airports where we operate 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   18 million  or 9  when compared to 2014  the increase is primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us with passenger and ramp handling 

we expect contracted services to be higher in 2016  due to higher rates and volumes as we continue to expand into new markets utilizing vendor services 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 12 million  or 6  compared to 2014  mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in seattle and increased credit card commissions due to higher revenue 

we expect selling expense to increase approximately 10 in 2016  as we refresh our brand and increase promotion and advertising in our core markets and as revenues increase 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 26 million  or 9  due to the increased number of aircraft in our fleet and cabin upgrades made in the past 18 months 

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase approximately 15 in 2016  as we continue to purchase aircraft for replacement of leased aircraft and for growth 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased  by 20 million  or 22  due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu offering higher quality food and beverage products 

we expect food and beverage expenses to increase approximately 5 in 2016  primarily because of the expected increase in passengers 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements increased   14 million  or 24  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase is primarily due to the five e175 aircraft operated by skywest added to our regional operation in 2015 

we expect thirdparty regional carrier expense to increase in 2016  as we continue to expand our regional network 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   48 million  or 16  compared to 2014  the increase is primarily due to professional services with regard to our brand refresh and network strategy personnel costs for our flight crews and itrelated costs 

we expect other operating expenses to increase 3 to 5 in 2016  primarily as a result of itrelated investments 

 27 

special items 

in the fourth quarter of 2015  we recorded special items of 32 million  20 million after tax this is due to a 14 million  million noncash pension settlement expense related to lumpsum payments made to terminated vested participants which removed them from participation in the pension plan and an 18 million expense related to ongoing litigation 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2015  we recorded nonoperating income of 14 million  compared to 13 million  in 2014  in the prior year we recognized gains on the sale of certain equity securities in the current year we have capitalized more of our interest expense on an increasing balance of prepaid aircraft deposits 

operating costs per available seat mile 

we are presenting our lineitem expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an asm basis to highlight areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity 



 

additional segment information 

refer to the notes of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

alaska mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 12 billion  in 2015  compared to 834 million  in 2014  the 165 million  increase in mainline passenger revenue is described previously mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by 236 million  due to higher wages to support our growth higher ramp and passenger handling associated with increased flying higher depreciation related to our fleet growth and increased food and beverage costs economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency slightly offset by an increase in consumption 

alaska regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 105 million  in 2015  compared to 74 million  in 2014  the 49 million  increase in alaska regional passenger revenue is described above the increase in revenue and the significant decline in fuel costs were partially offset by higher expenses to support additional departures 

 28 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 28 million  in 2015  compared to 17 million  in 2014  cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation increased due to additional capacity and higher rates the 26 million  increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was largely driven by increased engine maintenance and other expenses to support the increase in capacity 

2014  compared with 2013 

our consolidated net income for 2014  was 605 million  or 442  per diluted share compared to net income of 508 million  or 358  per diluted share in 2013  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

 

excluding the marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments special items and the onetime special mileage plan revenue item our adjusted consolidated net income for 2014  was 571 million  or 418  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 383 million  or 270  per share in 2013  



revenues adjusted for the onetime special mileage plan item is as follows

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   212 million  or 4  during 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  adjusted for the special mileage plan revenue item recognized in 2013 operating revenues increased 404 million or 8 during 2014  the changes are summarized in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2014   increased  by 8  on a 66  increase in capacity and a 14  increase in prasm compared to 2013  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes seats added to our existing fleet as part of our cabin improvement project and delivery of 10 737900ers in 2014  the increase in prasm was driven by a 19  increase in ticket yield partially offset by a 04point  decrease in load factor compared to the prior year increase in yield was due to reallocation of capacity to markets with stronger demand and by a change in revenue allocation between mainline and regional service because of certain industry pricing changes without the industry change mainline yields would have increased by 09 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 28 million  or 4  compared to 2013  on an 119  increase in capacity partially offset by a 73  decline in prasm compared to 2013  the decrease in prasm was due to a 62  decrease in ticket yield coupled with a 10point  decrease in load factor compared to the prior year the decline in yield was primarily driven by a change in revenue allocation between mainline and regional service because of certain industry pricing changes without the revenue allocation adjustment yield would have decreased 17 additionally the average trip length for our regional flights increased 3 in 2014  which also put downward pressure on yields 

 30 

other – net 

other – net revenue increased   91 million  or 16  from 2013  this is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan™ revenues of 39 million or 15 due to an increase in miles sold and an increase in cash received per mile additionally bag fees and ticket change fees are up 23 and 12 respectively due to changes in our fee structure that took effect in november 2013 

special mileage plan revenue 

in 2013 we modified and extended our cobranded credit card agreement with bac in connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards we recorded a onetime noncash special mileage plan revenue item of 192 million  primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to bank of america corporation referred to herein as bac 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   88 million  or 2  compared to 2013  primarily driven by higher nonfuel costs due to increased capacity we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2013  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2014  by 50 million  or 5  compared to 2013  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   9  primarily due to annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates a 47  increase in fulltime equivalent employees and an 8 million signing bonus paid to alaskas flight attendants in december 2014 in connection with the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement the increase in ftes was to support the growth in our business 

defined contribution plan expense increased 20  due to an increase in the number of employees participating in the plans and an increase in the employer contribution for nonunion employees previously in the pension plan 

pension expense decreased   82  compared to the same period in the prior year the decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets a higher discount rate at december 31 2013  compared to december 31 2012  and the freezing of plan benefits for our nonunion employees beginning january 1 2014 

 31 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  from 105 million  in 2013  to 116 million  in 2014  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense decreased   49 million  or 3  compared to 2013  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 49  in line with the increase in departures and capacity partially offset by a 21 improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by asms per gallon 

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 63 as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2014  was due to a decrease in average crude oil prices of 5 and a decline in refining margins of 16 as compared to the prior year 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 41 million  in 2014  compared to losses of 52 million  in 2013  these amounts represent the cash received or paid net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance decreased  by 18 million  or 7  compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a 22 million reduction in our powerbythehour pbh expense 11 million in lower lease return costs and five fewer unscheduled engine checks for our q400 aircraft offsetting these decreases was an 11 million increase in engine maintenance expense primarily related to our 737400 engines and slightly higher airframe checks for both our 737 and q400 fleet 

the decrease in our pbh expense is due to fewer engines covered by the contracts in the current year along with reduced flying on the engines that are still under the current contract the decrease is return costs is due to the four aircraft we returned during the current year and two aircraft we returned at the end of the prior year with no lease return costs expected for lease returns in 2015 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   17 million  or 6  primarily due to increased flying in 2014 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   20 million  or 11  primarily due to 15 million increase in contract ramp and passenger handling costs resulting from new stations and rate increases in seattle 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 20 million  or 11  compared to 2013  mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in seattle and increased credit card commissions from higher revenue 

 32 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 24 million  or 9  due to increased number of aircraft in our fleet 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased  by 9 million  or 11  due to the increased number of passengers and more premium product offerings 

thirdparty regional carrier expense 

thirdparty regional carrier expense which represents payments made to skywest and penair under our cpa agreements increased   13 million  or 29  in 2014  compared to 2013 the increase is primarily due to the three additional lines of flying performed by skywest in 2014 compared to 2013 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   30 million  or 11  compared to 2013  the increase is primarily driven by it project costs higher professional fees and flight crew hotel costs 

special items 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded special items for 30 million  this is primarily due to a 20 million noncash curtailment gain related to certain postretirement benefits that were reduced in 2014 the remaining gain is related to a onetime cash settlement related to a legal matter 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2014  we recorded nonoperating income of 13 million  compared to an expense of 22 million  in 2013  the 35 million  favorable change is due to gains recorded in the current year related to the sale of certain equity securities and reduced interest expense due to lower average debt levels additionally in the prior year we incurred costs of 12 million to overhaul and repair three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier

alaska mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 834 million  in 2014  compared to 530 million  in 2013  the 284 million  increase in mainline passenger revenue is described previously mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by 124 million  due to increased capacity departures expanding to new locations and higher advertising and promotional activity in seattle and our new locations additionally we increased spending on it infrastructure projects and incurred more depreciation as we continue to purchase aircraft economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to a decline in the economic price per gallon and increased fuel efficiency slightly offset by an increase in consumption 

alaska regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 74 million  in 2014  compared to 69 million in 2013  the 28 million  increase in alaska regional passenger revenue is described previously the increased regional revenue was offset by higher expenses to support additional capacity additionally we recorded a 12 million loss in 2013 related to overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 17 million  in 2014  compared to 20 million  in 2013  cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation increased due to additional capacity in the state of alaska the 8 million  increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was driven by increased wages to support additional aircraft in the fleet higher pilot training costs and increased depreciation and amortization due to the three additional q400 aircraft added in q4 of 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

in 2015  we took free and clear delivery of 11  b737900er aircraft we made debt payments totaling 116 million  in addition we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing 505 million  of our common stock in 2015  and paid dividends totaling 102 million  because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance we are one of only two airlines in the us with investment grade credit ratings we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal the portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

 34 



   

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

in 2015  we generated 16 billion  in operating cash flows compared to 10 billion  in 2014  the increase of 554 million  was primarily attributable to improved operating results driven largely by lower jet fuel costs 

cash provided by operating activities was 1 billion  in 2014  compared to 981 million  in 2013  the 49 million increase is primarily due to an increase in earnings and an increase in our advance ticket sales partially offset by a 177 million increase in payments for income taxes 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures and increasing shareholder value through the repurchase of our common stock and dividends 

  

 35 

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 930 million  during 2015  compared to 541 million  in 2014  our capital expenditures were 831 million  or 137 million  higher than in 2014  this is due to the delivery of 11  b737900ers one q400 aircraft and advance purchase deposits on 32 b737 aircraft that will be delivered over the next 24 months this compares to the delivery of ten b737900ers in the prior year in 2015 we replaced restricted cash on deposit of 52 million with a line of credit facility resulting in an increase in investing cash flows 

as of december 31 2015  we had firm commitments for 68  b737 aircraft through 2022  with options to acquire up to 46  additional 737 nextgen ng aircraft and max aircraft in 2018  through 2024  we also have firm commitments for two  q400s and options to acquire five  q400 aircraft with deliveries from 2018 to 2019 although we do not currently expect to take delivery of the firm orders or exercise the options in addition to the five  e175 aircraft currently operating in our regional fleet we have commitments to lease 18  e175 aircraft with start dates in 2016  through 2017  we also have options to lease eight  e175 aircraft with positions starting in late 2017  and early 2018  the options for all fleet types give us the flexibility but not the obligation to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met 

additionally we may purchase up to 30 regional jets to be operated by horizon with deliveries starting in 2017 at this time no order has been placed nor have any commercial terms been agreed upon 

the table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised additional options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met 



a  excludes contractual payments for two q400 aircraft in 2018 for which we do not expect to take delivery 

b  we may order 30 regional jets for deliveries over the next several years for which none of the related expenditures are included in the table above no commercial terms have been reached however if the order is placed in 2016 we would expect additional capital expenditures of approximately 40 million in 2016 

c 2015 actual capital expenditures include capitalized interest future expected capital expenditures exclude capitalized interest and represent only contractual or expected cash outlay for capital assets 

cash used in investing activities was 541 million  during 2014 compared to 698 million  in 2013 our capital expenditures were 694 million  in 2014 or 128 million higher than in 2013 this is due to the delivery of ten b737900er aircraft the completion of our b737 cabin improvement project and the exercise of 16 b737 options two q400 options and deposits for an incremental q400 in 2014 

cash used by financing activities 

  

cash used by financing activities was 688 million  during 2015  compared to 462 million  in 2014  during the current year we made debt payments of 116 million  stock repurchases of 505 million  and cash dividend payments of 102 million  in 2014  we made debt payments of 119 million  stock repurchases of 348 million  and cash dividend payments of 68 million  partially offset by proceeds from debt of 51 million  in 2013 we made debt payments of 161 million  and stock repurchases of 159 million  

  

we plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand internally generated cash from operations along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lines of credit 

  

the company has two 100 million credit facilities and a 52 million credit facility information about these facilities can be found in note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10k the company has no immediate plans to borrow using any of these facilities 

  

 36 

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

at december 31 2015  we had firm orders to purchase or lease 70  aircraft we also have options to acquire 46  b737 aircraft and options to acquire five  q400 aircraft although we do not expect to exercise the q400 options in addition to the five  e175 aircraft currently operated by skywest in our regional fleet we have commitments to lease 18  e175 aircraft with start dates in 2016 and 2017 we have options for eight  additional e175 aircraft with positions starting in late 2017  and early 2018  

as mentioned previously we may order 30 regional jets to be operated by horizon with deliveries starting in 2017 as no commercial terms have been reached at this time delivery positions and future capital expenditures are excluded from the fleet table and commitment table below however if the order is placed in 2016 we would expect additional capital expenditures of approximately 40 million in 2016 

the following table summarizes our projected fleet count by year as of february 11 2016  



 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows 



 37 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2015  



 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans for which there are no minimum required contributions the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 161 million  at december 31 2015  compared to a 133 million  unfunded position at december 31 2014  this results in a 92  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 94  funded as of december 31 2014  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets as measured by value are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices level of pension funding which is generally not known until late each year whether bonus depreciation provisions are available as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2015  we made tax payments net of refunds totaling 349 million  and had an effective tax rate of 354  we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 38 for 2016 and the effective rate of cash paid for income taxes to be in the range of 30 to 35 of book income although these estimates are subject to change we believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan™ loyalty program awards miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners we also sell services including miles for transportation to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a major bank that offers alaska airlines affinity credit cards in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

for miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our airline partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future for services sold through one of our nonairline partners the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered and the remaining components are recorded as commission in othernet revenue in the period the services are performed commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  was 280 million  261 million  and 213 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when the award travel occurs or the miles expire and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2015  we had approximately 161 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 814 million  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan™ expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan™ are described below 

   

we use the relative selling price method for the deferral of sales proceeds for contracts that were modified after the effective date of accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 200913 we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables this relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables a 1 shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately 6 million 

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan™ mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage considers historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors based on statistical analysis of historical data our current breakage rate is 174 a hypothetical 1 change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a 7 million effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan™ program and historical award redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flier travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan™ assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

pension plans 

  

our actuarial estimates of pension liability the related expense and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in note 7 

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rates to be used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and the interest and service cost changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate used for the obligation increases we discounted future pension obligations using rates between 455  and 469  at december 31 2015  and a rate of 420  at december 31 2014  the discount rates were determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from each of the four definedbenefit pension plans the discount rates we use are based on a yield curve that uses a pool of higheryielding bonds estimated to be more in line with settlement rates as we have taken steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future if the discount rate decreased by 05  our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2015  would increase by approximately 128 million  and our estimated 2016  pension expense would increase by approximately 8 million  

pension liability and future pension expense can increase or decrease as assumptions in the actuarial data changes in 2015  we engaged our thirdparty actuary to update demographic assumptions used in the valuation of the definedbenefit pension liabilities these assumptions included updates such as estimated salary increases employee turnover and retirement rates among other items the changes in these assumptions decreased our projected benefit obligation by approximately 50 million at december 31 2015  the primary cause of the decline was the change in expected participant retirement rates the study found that eligible employees are retiring later than they had in our previous assumption update resulting in lower expected cash flows post retirement 

pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2015  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate longterm rates of return between 600  and 650  which compares to 65  at december 31 2014  we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2015  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities us fixedincome securities and real estate a decrease in the expected longterm rate of return of 05  would increase our estimated 2016  pension expense by approximately 8 million  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans were frozen january 1 2014 furthermore in 2015  we offered lump sum payments to certain terminated vested participants in our definedbenefit pension plans in order to eliminate a significant portion of our outstanding liability as a result we reduced our projected benefit obligation by 62 million  and recorded a settlement charge of 14 million  in 2015  which is included in special items on the consolidated statement of operations 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 48 billion  of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 change in the forward curve for crude oil prices as of december 31 2015  would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio to approximately 8 million  or 2 million  respectively 

 38 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 4  million at december 31 2015  compared to a portfolio value of 7  million at december 31 2014  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2015  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see the derivative instruments note in our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2015  would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 1 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements our variablerate debt is approximately 24  of our total longterm debt at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2015  interest income would increase by approximately 14 million

low fares low costs and network growth 

we believe that in order to provide low fares for customers in a growing network of destinations while returning value to our shareholders we must maintain a competitive cost structure in 2014  we lowered our unit costs excluding fuel by 13  on a consolidated basis representing the fifth consecutive year of annual reduction we achieved this through a continued focus on productivity cost management and network growth we increased employee productivity by 20  in 2014 and will continue to focus on that metric as we leverage growth we also manage fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 45  over the last five years additionally we have added splitscimitar winglets to 48 aircraft which are expected to increase fuel efficiency by 15 per aircraft looking forward we have committed to purchasing 42  737900er and 37  737max aircraft with deliveries from 2015  to 2022  and three  q400 aircraft with deliveries from 2015  to 2017  in addition we will increase regional capacity by having skywest operate seven e175s with deliveries from 2015 to 2016 the capacity increase with the new b737s q400s and e175s position us for growth and ensure that we will continue to operate the most fuelefficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future 

 5 

in 2014  we added 16 new markets to our network and exited five as we continued to better match supply with demand we strengthened our seattle network in 2014 by offering nonstop flights to markets like albuquerque baltimore cancun detroit new orleans and tampa and began 7 nonstop routes out of salt lake city new routes in 2015 will include seattle to milwaukee oklahoma city and washington dc dulles from las vegas to mammoth lakes from san diego to kona and from portland to st louis 

air group 

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of alaska airlines and horizon air although alaska and horizon both operate as airlines their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 horizon was acquired by air group in 1986 alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets mainline and contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity such that alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement the majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers but in recent years we have focused on growing our ancillary revenues the percentage of revenues by category is as follows 



we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in ways that best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce our seasonality 

the percentage of our capacity by region is as follows 



mainline 

we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and 24 cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2014  we carried 21 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations at december 31 2014  alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 137  boeing 737 jet aircraft compared to 131  b737 aircraft as of december 31 2013

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by region and average stage length is presented below 



regional 

  

our regional operations consist of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2014  our regional operations carried approximately 83 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and carries about 90 of air groups regional revenue passengers in 2014 we increased regional jet flying provided by skywest and amended our capacity purchase agreement to start flying embraer e175s which will support new markets such as seattlemilwaukee seattleoklahoma city and portlandst louis in 2015 

based on 2014  passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our leading airports are seattle and portland at december 31 2014  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 51  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under alaskas designator code in airline reservation systems and in customerfacing locations

mileage plan 

the alaska airlines mileage plan™ program provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flier benefits miles can be earned by flying on alaska or on one of our 14 airline partners or by using the alaska airlines visa signature card or through other nonairline partners our extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with two of the three major global alliances oneworld and skyteam making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach preferred status in our mileage plan™ and have access to a large network of travel destinations further members can receive 25000 bonus miles upon signing up for the alaska airlines visa signature card and earn triple miles on purchases made on alaska airlines flights or on alaskaaircom alaska airlines visa signature cardholders also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus tax with no restrictions or blackout dates earned miles can be redeemed for flights on alaska airlines or on any of our partner airlines or for upgrades to first class on alaska airlines for as low as 15000 miles all of these benefits give our mileage plan™ members more value for their travel on alaska airlines which led to our mileage plan™ receiving the highest rank by frequent fliers in the firstever jd power airline loyaltyrewards program satisfaction report in 2014 

mileage plan™ revenues represent approximately 10 of air groups total revenues furthermore our mileage plan™ helps drive more revenue through attaining new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide the

mileage plan™ provides more value per dollar spent on the alaska airlines visa signature card in comparison to other comparable frequent flier programs in the industry summary of the benefits provided in comparison to some of our competitors are as follows 



agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flier codeshare and interline agreements frequent flier agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our mileage plan™ members alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flier programs for our mileage plan™ members through our frequent flier partnerships with 14 domestic and international carriers 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flier codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to customers 

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flier and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

the comprehensive summary of alliances with other airlines is as follows 



 

the following is the financial impact of our marketing alliances

other revenue 

other revenue consists of freight and mail revenue and ancillary revenue such as bag fees change fees onboard food and beverage and boardroom membership total other revenue excluding mileage plan™ revenue represents about 3 of our total revenues in recent years we have seen growth in our ancillary revenue as we expand services onboard such as tom douglas signature meals inflight entertainment and wifi we have increased our bag fees to better match industry average prices but we also offer a 20minute bag guarantee so that we deliver value to our customers through fast reliable service as we focus on ways to better serve our customers we expect our ancillary revenues will continue to grow 

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive subject to various uncertainties and has historically been characterized by low profit margins uncertainties include general economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2014  the airline industry reported record revenues and profits as the global economy continued to recover and oil prices were stable for most of the year with a significant decline in the fourth quarter as the industry strengthens airlines are now making significant investments in airports in new planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering thus the level of competition is expected to increase 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 27  to 35  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the us 

  

the average annual price of crude oil in the last five years has increased from a low of 80  per barrel in 2010  to a high of 98  in 2013 although the price of crude oil was 53 per barrel at the end of 2014 the fullyear average was 93  per barrel for us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 11 million  of fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 5 million  per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years refining margin prices have fluctuated between 14  per barrel and 36  per barrel in the last five years and averaged 23 in 2014 

generally west coast aircraft fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting our operation at a competitive disadvantage our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased   6  in 2014  decreased 4 in 2013  and increased 2 in 2012  

 10 

the percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



 

we use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices historically we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts but we discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in the third quarter of 2014 call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums currently we hedge approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet and horizon operates an allbombardier q400 turboprop fleet air groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 736  asmsg in 2010  to 769  asmsg in 2014  these improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport our five principal competitors in order of competitive overlap are delta united southwest american and hawaiian delta significantly increased their capacity at seatac in 2014 and we expect them to continue to do so in 2015 based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap from these carriers to increase more than 12 in 2015 weighted based on our network we also compete with several other domestic and international carriers but to a lesser extent than with our principal competitors 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our customers 

  

   

 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance passenger amenities  including first class seating quality of buyonboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2014  alaska airlines ranked “highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers” by jd power and associates for the seventh  year in a row all of our 2014 mainline aircraft deliveries included the boeing sky interior and we launched the new alaska beyond™ inflight experience which features our streaming inflight entertainment gourmet food designed by tom douglas and comfortable seats with additional space and power as part of our exceptional above and beyond flight experience 

 

the pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

 11 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing approximately 85 of total seats accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields we will defend our core markets vigorously and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe the restructuring weve completed over the past decade has decreased our costs to the point we can offer competitive fares while still earning appropriate pretax margins 

 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flier opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our customers we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flier mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our customers access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our customers more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flier miles our mileage plan™ offers one of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 14 of our partner carriers 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we also compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets in the regional operations both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



 12 

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have taken steps over the past few years to better manage the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations like hawaii and expanding to cities in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• changes in fuel costs 

  

   

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and reaccommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2014  we employed 13952   10846  at alaska and 3106  at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 41  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in both 2014  and 2013  

most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand at december 31 2014  labor unions represented 83  of alaska’s and 48  of horizon’s employees our relations with our us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2014  were as follows 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2014  were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 

  15 

from time to time for alleged violations of fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund amendments and reauthorization act and the oil pollution control act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

we expect there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions alaska and horizon have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties we also have coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprise wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterpriselevel identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local level including increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment minimum wage requirements and health care mandates that could affect our relationship with our workforce and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs 

  

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers related to higher security costs increased costs related to updated infrastructures and other costs additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

 17 

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems and information technology infrastructure and services as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future especially since we rely on timely and effective thirdparty performance in conjunction with many of our technologyrelated initiatives in addition in recent years alaska and horizon have subcontracted their heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

  

 

 

   

   

 

   

 

 

due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 18 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly on the west coast therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle los angeles anchorage portland hawaii and san diego a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2014  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 61  of our total passengers 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing and the internet or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 19 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flier marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan™ program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flier arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan™ program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan™ which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline consolidation or reorganization could occur in the future we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements frequent flier program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruptions untimely recovery or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs 

we accept store and transmit information about our customers our employees our business partners and our business in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

 20 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 32  34  and 35  of total operating expenses for the years ended 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 

certain of our credit facilities and indentures governing our secured borrowings impose certain operating and financial covenants on us such covenants require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios and other negative covenants customary for such financings a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and we may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing 

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet 

as of december 31 2014  the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737800 900 900ers was approximately 61  years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 81  years our relatively new aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all customers 

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant improvements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs 

in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 41  42  and 42  of our nonfuel operating expenses in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them the same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs that ultimately flow through to us 

as of december 31 2014  labor unions represented approximately 83  of alaska’s and 48  of horizon’s employees although we have been successful in maturing communications negotiating approaches and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the companys longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

 21 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in the companys strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in recent years there have been pilot shortages in the regional market attrition beyond normal levels could negatively impact our operating results and our business prospects could be harmed

year in review 

our 2014  consolidated pretax income was 975 million  compared to 816 million  in 2013  the 159 million  improvement was primarily due to the net increase of 212 million  in revenues a decrease of 49 million in our fuel expense and 13 million in nonoperating income compared to a nonoperating loss of 22 million in the prior year partially offsetting these benefits was an increase in nonfuel operating expenses of 167 million  or 6  to support the increased capacity of 7  

the growth in revenues of 212 million  was primarily due to an increase in passenger revenue of 312 million  resulting from a 65  increase in traffic and 07  higher ticket yields partially offset by a special mileage plan revenue item of 192 million resulting from the adoption of new accounting standards in the prior year the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits contracted services and depreciation expense as we expanded our fleet and entered into new markets where we almost exclusively use vendors for our station operations

capital allocation 

in 2014  we repurchased 7316731  shares of our common stock for 348 million  under the share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors since 2007 we have repurchased 49 million  shares of common stock under such programs for 827 million  for an average price of approximately 17  per share in 2014  we increased our quarterly dividend 25 from 010 per share to 0125 per share and subsequent to december 31 2014  we announced a 60 increase to 020 per share overall we returned 416 million to shareholders during 2014 and expect to exceed that amount in 2015

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run safe compliant and reliable operations at our airlines in addition to our primary objective we will remain focused on providing a hasslefree experience for our customers and building a compelling brand to support network growth specifically we will continue to improve our inflight experience with our alaska beyond™ inflight experience featuring tom douglas signature meals new streaming inflight entertainment comfortable recaro seats with power at every seat and our awardwinning customer service 

currently we see strong demand for 2015 and because of our strong balance sheet and the structure of our fleet we will flex our fleet to meet demand and allocate capacity in the markets that meet our return objectives this includes our expectation to grow departures out of seattle by 10 in 2015 additionally competitive capacity is expected to be 15 higher in the first quarter and 12 higher in 2015 based on current schedules we expect delta air lines our largest direct competitor to increase its overlapping capacity from 41 in 2014 to 50 in 2015 

longterm we plan to vigorously defend our markets through great customer service mileage plan™ promotions schedule changes community events and additional advertising efforts we will also continue to focus on lowering unit costs so that we can compete more effectively furthermore the significant decline in fuel prices over the past several months improves our financial outlook as fuel is one of our largest operating expenses 

given our current fleet plan we expect capacity to increase approximately 11 in the first quarter of 2015 and between 9 and 10 for the fullyear 2015 

results   of operations 

  

2014  compared with 2013   

our consolidated net income for 2014  was 605 million  or 442  per diluted share compared to net income of 508 million  or 358  per diluted share in 2013  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

 

adjusted nongaap results and   pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of marktomarket gains or losses or other individual revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

excluding the impact of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments special items and the onetime special mileage plan revenue item our adjusted consolidated net income for 2014  was 571 million  or 418  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 383 million  or 270  per share in 2013

operating statistics summary unaudited

below are operating statistics we use to measure performance we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which is a nongaap measure 



 

 32 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   212 million  or 4  during 2014  compared to the same period in 2013  adjusted for the special mileage plan revenue item recognized in 2013 operating revenues increased 404 million  or 8  during 2014 the changes are summarized in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2014   increased  by 8  on a 66   increase  in capacity and a 14   increase  in prasm compared to 2013  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes seats added to our existing fleet as part of our cabin improvement project and delivery of 10 737900ers in 2014  the increase  in prasm was driven by a 19   increase  in ticket yield partially offset by a 04 point   decrease  in load factor compared to the prior year increase in yield was due to reallocation of capacity to markets with stronger demand and by a change in revenue allocation between mainline and regional service because of certain industry pricing changes without the industry change mainline yields would have increased by 09 

we expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2015 however we expect total passenger revenue to increase with the expected 8 growth in our capacity 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 28 million  or 4  compared to 2013  on an 119   increase  in capacity partially offset by a 73   decrease  in prasm compared to 2013  the decrease  in prasm was due to a 62   decrease  in ticket yield coupled with a 10 point   decrease  in load factor compared to the prior year the decline in yield was driven mostly by a change in revenue allocation between mainline and regional service because of certain industry pricing changes without the revenue allocation adjustment yield would have decreased 17 additionally the average trip length for our regional flights increased 3 which also put downward pressure on yields 

we expect regional passenger revenue to increase in 2015 primarily due to our expanded capacity purchase agreement with skywest to fly e175 regional aircraft beginning in the third quarter of 2015 these aircraft will offer three booking classes 

other – net 

other—net revenue increased   91 million  or 16  from 2013  this is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan™ revenues of 39 million  or 15  due to increase in miles sold and an increase in cash received per mile additionally bag fees and ticket change fees are up 23 and 12 respectively due to changes in our fee structure that took effect in november 2013 

we expect our other—net revenue to increase in 2015 as we provide more product offerings and have more passengers 

special mileage plan revenue 

in 2013 we modified and extended our cobranded credit card agreement with bank of america corporation bac in connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards we recorded a onetime noncash special mileage plan revenue item of 192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to bac 

 33 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   88 million  or 2  compared to 2013  primarily driven by higher nonfuel costs due to increased capacity we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



nm  not meaningful 

significant operating expense variances from 2013  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2014  by 50 million  or 5  compared to 2013  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   9  primarily due to annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates a 47  increase in fulltime employee equivalents and an 8 million signing bonus paid to alaskas flight attendants in december 2014 when a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified the increase in ftes is to support the growth in our business 

defined contribution plans increased   20  due to an increase in the number of employees participating in the plans and an increase in the employer contribution for nonunion employees previously in the pension plan 

pension expense decreased   82  compared to the same period in the prior year the decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets a higher discount rate at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 and the freezing of plan benefits for our nonunion employees beginning january 1 2014 

we expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2015  compared to 2014  on a 3 to 4 increase in ftes and higher pension expense of approximately 20 million 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  from 105 million  in 2013  to 116 million  in 2014  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year in addition to a higher wage base 

we expect variable incentive pay in 2015  to be lower due to changes to our incentive pay metrics to reflect our improving performance however actual amounts could differ based on 2015 performance 

 34 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense decreased   49 million  or 3  compared to 2013  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 49  in line with the increase in departures and capacity partially offset by a 21  improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by asms per gallon 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 63  as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2014  was due to a decrease in average crude oil prices of 52  and decrease in refining margins of 157  as compared to the prior year 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from or pay to hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 41 million  in 2014  compared to losses of 52 million  in 2013  these amounts represent the cash received or paid net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

in the third quarter of 2014  we discontinued the hedge program for refining margins we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 410  lower in the first quarter of 2015  than the first  quarter of 2014  due to lower west coast jet fuel prices and the decrease in premium costs related to our fuel hedge program as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance decreased  by 18 million  or 7  compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a 22 million reduction in our powerbythehour pbh expense 11 million in lower lease return costs and five fewer unscheduled engine checks for our q400 aircraft offsetting these decreases was an 11 million increase in engine maintenance expense primarily related to our 737400 engines and slightly higher airframe checks for both our 737 and q400 fleet 

the decrease in our pbh expense is due to fewer engines covered by the contracts in the current year along with reduced flying on the engines that are still under the current contract the decrease is return costs is due to the four aircraft we returned 

 35 

during the current year and two aircraft we returned at the end of the prior year with no lease return costs expected for lease returns in 2015 

we expect aircraft maintenance to be 10 to 15 higher in 2015  due to an increase in our engine maintenance expense for both fleet types 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rental expenses increased 17 million  or 6  primarily due to increased flying in 2014 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets 

we expect landing fees and other rental expenses to increase in 2015  due to the expected capacity growth 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   33 million  or 15  including 15 million additional purchased capacity from skywest and 15 million increased contract ramp and passenger handling costs resulting from new stations and rate increases in seattle 

we expect contracted services to be higher in 2015  as we expand into new stations and start e175 flying with skywest 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 20 million  or 11  compared to 2013  mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in seattle and increased credit card commissions from higher revenue 

we expect selling expense to increase in 2015  reflecting our growth in passengers 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased  by 24 million  or 9  due to increased number of aircraft in our fleet 

we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase approximately 15 in the next year as we continue to purchase aircraft and make other customer focused investments 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage service expenses increased  by 9 million  or 11  due to the increased number of passengers and more premium product offerings 

we expect food and beverage expenses to outpace passenger growth in 2015  as we invest more in our onboard product 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   30 million  or 11  compared to 2013  the increase is primarily driven by it project costs higher professional fees and flight crew hotel costs 

we expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2015  due to additional training costs and other personnel expenses 

special items 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded special items for 30 million  this is primarily due to a 20 million noncash curtailment gain related to certain postretirement benefits that were reduced in 2014 the remaining gain is related to a onetime cash settlement related to a legal matter 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

during 2014 we recorded nonoperating income of 13 million  compared to an expense of 22 million  in 2013 the 35 million  favorable change is due to gains recorded in the current year related to the sale of certain equity securities and reduced 

 36 

interest expense due to lower average debt levels additionally in the prior year we incurred costs of 12 million to overhaul and repair three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier 

operating costs per available seat mile 

we are presenting our lineitem expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an asm basis to highlight areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity 



 

additional segment information

alaska mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 834 million  in 2014  compared to 530 million  in 2013  the 284 million  increase in mainline passenger revenue is described previously mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by 124 million  due to increased capacity departures expanding to new locations and higher advertising and promotional activity in seattle and our new locations additionally we increased spending on it infrastructure projects and incurred more depreciation as we continue to purchase aircraft economic fuel cost as defined above decreased due to a decline in the economic price per gallon and increased fuel efficiency slightly offset by an increase in consumption 

alaska regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 74 million  in 2014  compared to 69 million  in 2013  the 28 million  increase in alaska regional passenger revenue is described previously the increased regional revenue was offset by higher expenses to support additional capacity additionally we recorded a 12 million loss in 2013 related to overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 17 million  in 2014  compared to 20 million  in 2013  cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation increased due to additional capacity in the state of alaska the 8 million  increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was driven by increased wages to support additional aircraft in the fleet higher pilot training costs and increased depreciation and amortization due to the three additional q400 aircraft added in q4 of 2013 

 37 

2013  compared with 2012 

our consolidated net income for 2013  was 508 million  or 358  per diluted share compared to net income of 316 million  or 220  per diluted share in 2012  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

excluding the marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and the onetime special mileage plan revenue item our adjusted consolidated net income for 2013  was 383 million  or 270  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 339 million  or 237  per share in 2012

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   499 million  or 11  during 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  the changes are summarized in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2013   increased  by 6  on a 79 increase in capacity and a 15 increase in prasm compared to 2012  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2013  and larger aircraft the decrease in prasm was driven by a 09 decrease in ticket yield and a 05 point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year increased competition in the state of alaska and along the west coast put downward pressures on yield and load factor 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 31 million  or 4  compared to 2012  on a 04 increase in capacity and 37 increase in prasm compared to 2012  the increase in prasm was due to a 14 increase in ticket yield coupled with a 18 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the increase in regional revenues is due to better matching the right aircraft with the right market to avoid oversupply of capacity and maintaining yields and load factors 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased   2 million  or 2  primarily due to increased freight volumes 

other – net 

other – net revenue increased   68 million  or 13  from 2012  this is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan™ revenues of 47 million or 22 as a result of a higher rate per mile sold to bank of america corporation bac under our new affinity card program and growth in the mileage plan™ program additionally bag fees increased by 78 and change fees increased by 73 due to increases in the number of passengers 

special mileage plan revenue 

in 2013 we modified and extended our cobranded credit card agreement with bac in connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards we recorded a onetime noncash special mileage plan revenue item of 192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to bac 

 39 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   193 million  or 5  compared to 2012  primarily driven by wages and variable incentive pay fuel expense remained flat due to a decrease in fuel cost per gallon offset by an increase in fuel consumption we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2012  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2013  by 48 million  or 5  compared to 2012  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   6  primarily due to a ratified contract with alaskas pilots that was effective april 1 2013 additionally we hired 2 more ftes to support increased flying and other strategic initiatives such as it and hasslefree projects 

pension expense decreased   12  compared to the same period in the prior year the decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets and improved funded status compared to the prior year 

medical benefits increased   5  from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee healthcare claims and an increase in the cost of health care services 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  from 88 million  in 2012  to 105 million  in 2013  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year 

 40 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense increased   8 million  or 1  compared to 2012  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 59 in line with the increase in departures and capacity 

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 36 as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2013 was due to a decline in refining margins of 27 offset by the increase in average crude oil prices of 4 as compared to the prior year 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 52 million in 2013 compared to losses of 24 million in 2012 these amounts represent the cash received or paid net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance increased  by 25 million  or 11  compared to the prior year primarily due to a 14 million increase in lease return provisions during the year we modified one of our powerbythehour agreements and terminated another related to our b737 fleet resulting in a decrease in expense under those agreements but an increase in engine events and related expense that we are now responsible for for our b737 and q400 fleets we also experienced heavier more expensive checks on flat volumes 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   19 million  or 8  primarily due to the increase in rates from the port of seattle lease signed in late 2013 additionally we experienced increased rates throughout our network with increased departures and passengers 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   21 million  or 11  primarily due to more capacity purchase flying with skywest and higher rates with penair additionally we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling costs and other services as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 11 million  or 6  compared to 2012  as a result of higher commissions with credit cards and interline commissions related to international routes 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   30 million  or 13  compared to 2012  the increase is driven by a variety of factors such as higher professional fees it costs losses on the disposal of assets property taxes and new uniforms

refer to the notes of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a summary of each segments profitability 

alaska mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 530 million in 2013 compared to 466 million in 2012 the 206 million increase in mainline passenger revenue is described previously as well as the increased revenues from the modified credit card agreement mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by 162 million driven mainly by increased wages and incentive pay increased rates and volumes on landing fees and rents and increased other expenses to support our growth in operations economic fuel cost as defined above increased due to a 68 increase in consumption on a slight decrease in the economic price per gallon 

alaska regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 69 million in 2013 compared to 62 million in 2012 the 31 million increase in alaska regional passenger revenue is described previously alaska regional expenses were slightly higher due to additional flying by skywest and higher rates from penair and increased landing fees and rents due to increased flying and higher rates also impacting pretax profit is the 12 million loss due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 20 million in 2013 compared to 24 million in 2012 cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation decreased due to lower operational incentives being met the 3 million increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was driven by wages and incentive pay and an increase in airframe checks and other unscheduled events

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

in 2014  we took free and clear delivery of ten b737900er aircraft we made debt payments totaling 119 million  in addition we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing 348 million  of our common stock in 2014  and paid dividends totaling 68 million  because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance in 2014  we became one of only two airlines in the us with investment grade credit ratings we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



   

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

in 2014  we generated over 1 billion  in operating cash flows compared to 981 million  in 2013  the increase of 49 million  is primarily due to an increase in earnings an increase in our advance ticket sales and a decrease in pension contributions partially offset by a 177 million increase in payments for income taxes 

cash provided by operating activities was 981 million  in 2013  compared to 753 million  in 2012  the 228 million increase is primarily due to an increase in revenues excluding special mileage plan revenue item an increase in cash receipts related to our mileage plan™ program decrease in pension contributions and cash savings in 2013 as we shortened the tenor of our fuel hedge program partially offsetting these increases were additional cash paid in taxes and an increase in operating expenses to support the growth in revenues 

 43 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures and increasing shareholder value by stock repurchases and dividends 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 541 million  during 2014  compared to 698 million  in 2013  our capital expenditures were 694 million  or 128 million  higher than in 2013  this is due to the delivery of ten b737900ers the completion of our b737 cabin improvement project and the exercise of 16 b737 options two q400 options and deposits for an incremental q400 this compares to the delivery of nine b737900ers and three q400s in the prior year 

as of december 31 2014 we had firm commitments for 73  b737 aircraft through 2022  with options to acquire up to 48  additional 737 nextgen ng aircraft and max aircraft in 2017  through 2024  we also have options to acquire five q400 aircraft with deliveries from 2018 to 2019 the options for all fleet types give us the flexibility but not the obligation to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met 

the table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised included in the table are six new aircraft two of which are options exercises and four of which are expected new aircraft orders approved by the board of directors on february 10 2015 these aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2016 and 2017 additional options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met 



cash used in investing activities was 698 million during 2013 compared to 645 million in 2012 our capital expenditures were 566 million or 48 million higher than in 2012 this is due to the delivery of nine b737900er aircraft and three q400 aircraft compared to four b737900er aircraft three b737800 aircraft and two q400 aircraft in the prior year

cash used by financing activities was 462 million  during 2014  compared to 325 million  in 2013  during the current year we made debt payments of 119 million  stock repurchases of 348 million  and cash dividend payments of 68 million  partially offset by proceeds from debt of 51 million  in 2013  we made debt payments of 161 million  stock repurchases of 159 million  and cash dividend payments of 28 million in 2012 we made debt payments of 275 million  and stock repurchases of 60 million which was offset by proceeds from a reimbursement for our los angeles international airport t6 project of 178 million 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

the company has two 100 million credit facilities both facilities have variable interest rates based on libor plus a specified margin one of the 100 million  facilities which expires in september 2017  is secured by aircraft the other 100 million  facility is secured by certain accounts receivable spare engines spare parts and ground service equipment and expires march 2017  the company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

at december 31 2014 we had firm orders to purchase 76  aircraft in addition we had options to acquire 48 additional b737 aircraft and options to acquire five  q400 aircraft also we have options to add regional capacity by having skywest operate up to 16  more e175 aircraft than the seven aircraft we already have committed 

 44 

the following table summarizes our projected fleet count by year as of february 11 2015  



 

for future firm orders and option exercises we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

all of our future oil positions are call options which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums our crude oil positions are as follows

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2014  



 

defined benefit pensions 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans which could be approximately 30 to 35 million in 2015 although there is no minimum required contribution the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 133 million  at december 31 2014  compared to a 60 million  overfunded position at december 31 2013  this results in a 94  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 104  funded as of december 31 2013  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets as measured by value are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices level of pension funding which is generally not known until late each year whether bonus depreciation provisions are available as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control 

in 2014  we made tax payments of 326 million  and had an effective tax rate of 379  in early 2015  we will receive a tax refund of approximately 80 million primarily due to an overpayment of estimated tax prior to bonus depreciation legislation enacted late in 2014  we believe that we have the liquidity to make our future tax payments

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan™ loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners we also sell services including miles for transportation to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a major bank that offers alaska airlines affinity credit cards in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners as long as the mileage plan™ is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

for miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future for services sold through one of our nonairline partners the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered and the remaining components are recorded as commission in othernet revenue in the period the services are performed commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  was 261 million  213 million  and 143 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines or expire and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2014  we had approximately 146 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 730 million  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan™ expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan™ are described below 

   

we defer sales proceeds under two accounting methodologies the relative selling price method which represents approximately 94 of sold miles and the residual accounting method which represents the remaining 6 for contracts that were modified after the effective date of accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 200913 we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables this relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables a 1 shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately 4 million 

for remaining contracts that continue to be accounted for under the residual method as our estimates of selling price change the amount we defer changes resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds to commission revenue in any given period a 10 increase in the estimated selling price of travel and related deferral rate would decrease commission revenue by approximately 2 million in the period cash is received this amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place 

 47 

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan™ mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage considers historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors based on statistical analysis of historical data our current breakage rate is 174 a hypothetical 1 change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a 6 million effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan™ program and historical award redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flier travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan™ assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

pension plans 

  

accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements and requires recognition of the changes in funded status in other comprehensive income pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 9 million  50 million  and 57 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we expect the 2015  expense to be approximately 28 million  as a result of a lower discount rate a lower expected return on assets and an increase in estimated participant longevity assumptions 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate increases we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 420  and 485  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the discount rate was determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans at december 31 2014  we refined the yield curve to use a pool of higheryielding bonds estimated to be more reflective of settlement rates as we are taking steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future if the discount rate decreased by 05  from 420  to 370  our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2014  would increase by approximately 152 million  and our estimated 2015  pension expense would increase by approximately 10 million  

 48 

pension liability and future pension expense can increase or decrease as assumptions in the actuarial data changes in december 31 2014  new mortality tables became available using more recent participant data the new tables are intended to update and replace the rp2000 tables that have been used in actuarial valuations since 2000 we have elected to apply proprietary mortality tables provided by a third party actuary which is segregated into industryspecific mortality information and includes actual participant data from our plans as expected the tables reflect the longer expected lifespans of employees generally speaking the new tables reflect an 11  12 longer life expectancy of people age 65 than the 2000 tables the change in the assumption increased our projected benefit obligation by approximately 80 million at december 31 2014  

pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2014  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 650  which decreased 025 from the rate at december 31 2013  the decrease in rate is due to the shift of our pension asset portfolio into more fixed income investments that better match the cash flows of our expected benefit payments and reduce the volatility of future returns we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2014  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixedincome securities a decrease in the expected longterm rate of return of 05  from 650  to 600  would increase our estimated 2015  pension expense by approximately 10 million  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans were frozen january 1 2014 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 43 billion  of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options historically we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts but we have discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in the third quarter of 2014 call options effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with call options we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2014  would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio by approximately 3 million  

 49 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 7  million at december 31 2014  compared to a portfolio value of 16  million at december 31 2013  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2014  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see the derivative instruments note in our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2014  would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 1 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements our variablerate debt is approximately 24  of our total longterm debt at december 31 2014  compared to 19  at december 31 2013  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2014  interest income would increase by approximately 14 million

alaska air group operates alaska airlines and horizon air which together with its partner regional airlines serve nearly 100 cities through an expansive network in alaska the lower 48 hawaii canada and mexico during 2013  we carried 27 million  passengers while earning record fullyear adjusted earnings of 383 million  

our objective is to be one of the most respected us airlines by our customers employees and shareholders we believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with customers by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a competitive cost structure to compete effectively over the past decade we have worked to transform our company to achieve these objectives in 2013  alaska airlines ranked “highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers” by jd power and associates for the sixth  year in a row we have been the leader in the industry for ontime performance among major airlines for the past four years in 2013  we reported our tenth  consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis and achieved an aftertax return on invested capital of 136  surpassing our 10 goal for the fourth  year in a row strong earnings improved our cash flow and strengthened our balance sheet resulting in i lower debttocapital ratio of 35  ii cash and marketable securities balance of 13 billion and iii fullyfunded definedbenefit pension plans this minimizes our financial risk and led standard and poors to upgrade our credit rating to bb in 2013  in addition over the past decade we have diversified our network to better respond to the seasonality in our business and provide more destinations for our customers since 2007 we have added 102 new routes to our network as we look to the future we will build on the success of the past few years by executing our strategic plan — the five focus areas 

safety and compliance 

we have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives alaska and horizon in coordination with the faa began implementing a safety management system sms to better identify and manage risk both airlines achieved level 2 certification in 2013  and are currently moving forward to level 3 certification our goal is to reach level 4 certification for a fullyimplemented and faaapproved sms by 2015 during the current year 100 of our alaska aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the faas diamond certificate of excellence award for the 12th consecutive year and our horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the 12th time in the last 14 years 

  

people focus 

while aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation we recognize this is fundamentally a people business and our success depends on our employees strengthening our small company feel will allow our employees to execute as a unified team on the frontlines and behind the scenes air group employees have attended our flight path program a oneday workshop to share the future vision for our company in addition all employees participate in the performancebased pay pbp and operational performance rewards opr programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety profitability ontime performance low costs and customer satisfaction over the last five  years our incentive programs have paid out over 430 million  this is consistent with one of our guiding principles that we want to pay our people well with a goal of reaching the industry’s best productivity over time to that end we signed three longterm agreements with various labor groups during the year and reached tentative fiveyear agreements with the alaska flight attendants in december 2013 and with the clerical office and passenger service employees in february 2014 additionally we have voluntarily contributed 620 million  to our pensions over the past five years making us the only airline that has fullyfunded definedbenefit pension plans 

hasslefree customer experience 

we want to be the easiest airline to fly which we will do by improving each step of the customers journey from booking a ticket to our inflight experience during 2013  we upgraded our android and iphone applications to allow our customers to book tickets shop for partner awards sign up for the mileage plan pay for bags track flight details checkin get push notifications utilize iphone passbook and google wallet and view upgrade status and standby lists we surpassed 1 million customer downloads of our apps during the year we also increased the number of selfbag tagging locations to eight in 2013  sea pdx anc san sat slc mci and msp which allows customers to print and attach their own luggage tags from a selfservice kiosk in the airport lobby we tested at home web bagtagging for those traveling direct to our hawaii destinations and are working closely with the tsa to offer this option more broadly in 2014 the transportation security administration tsa precheck program is available in 27 of our locations which allows eligible customers to optin for reduced screening 

 4 

requirements and the precheck notification is now visible on our boarding passes as passengers take more control of their travel experience we are able to reduce the time it takes a customer to move from the airport curb to the aircraft 

at seattletacoma international airport seatac we started transforming the airports north satellite terminal into an upgraded modernized facility that will become our airlines primary terminal and will enhance the customer experience and support growth the project will include design upgrades enhanced traveler amenities additional gates and a new rooftop boardroom together with the seatac airport we will break ground in 2014 on a project to install sloped walkways from the cconcourse to groundlevel boarding areas along with new covered walkways to the aircraft in several years alaska will be the sole airline tenant of the north satellite and horizon will operate entirely from the c concourse 

we continued to improve our inflight experience with our cabin upgrade project featuring the innovative and comfortable recaro seats with both 110volt and usb power outlets for every passenger and an enhanced inflight entertainment system that allows customers to stream movies and television shows to any wifi enabled device the first aircraft complete with seats with power debuted in december and we expect to finish the project for the majority of our 737s by the end of 2014 also in 2013 we purchased nine new 737900ers with the boeing sky interior which includes variable ambient cabin lighting larger window recesses and overhead bins which provide more headroom all designed to offer a greater sense of space in 2014 we expect to purchase ten new 737900ers with the boeing sky interior 

energetic and compelling brand 

we are fortunate to have high brand awareness and customer loyalty in the pacific northwest and alaska our core markets to maintain market share in core markets while also growing in newer markets like california hawaii and cities in the midcontinental and eastern us we believe we must better understand what is important to our customers and position our brand appropriately to help differentiate us from the competition in 2013 we aggressively optimized our marketing initiatives to help us to continue to raise awareness and consideration in new markets and increase advocacy in established ones in pursuit of building an energetic and compelling brand in 2014 we will be making a significant investment in our brand refresh initiative 

we continue to leverage our brand and technology to develop a direct relationship with more of our customers in 2013  approximately 55  of our ticket sales were made through alaskaaircom  up a point from 2012 in addition to more traditional online advertising efforts we continue to invest in our social media communities such as facebook and twitter we saw healthy increases in both of our primary social communities with facebook growing by 459 and twitter by 432 

in 2013  we expanded our customer support team so that we can continue to provide customers with exceptional customer service throughout their journey 

also in support of our brand we position ourselves as the industry leader in community and environmental stewardship in 2013  we were named the most fuelefficient airline in the us by the international council on clean transportation collected and recycled over 77 of waste collected during flights and donated 76 million to more than 1300 charitable organizations including support for the grand opening of aviation high school in seattle and other educational efforts our employees also volunteered more than 10500 hours of community service 

low fares low costs and network growth 

in order to provide low fares to our customers while returning value to our shareholders we believe we must maintain a competitive cost structure in 2013  we lowered our unit costs excluding fuel by 01  on a consolidated basis representing the 11th such annual reduction out of the past 12 years we achieved this through a continued focus on productivity in 2013  we increased employee productivity by 40  and will continue to focus on that metric as we leverage growth we also continue to manage fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 37  over the last five years looking forward we have committed to purchasing 32  737900er and 37  737max aircraft with deliveries in 2014  to 2022  to position us for growth and ensure we will continue to operate the quietest and most fuelefficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future 

in 2013  we added 17 new markets to our network and exited two as we continued to better match supply with demand we diversified our network further to offer more utility to our customers by expanding services out of anchorage portland san diego and seattle and began service to salt lake city omaha steamboat springs and colorado springs we will also add new routes out of salt lake city to boise los angeles las vegas portland san diego san jose and san francisco in 2014

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of alaska airlines and horizon air although alaska and horizon both operate as airlines their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 horizon was acquired by air group in 1986 alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets mainline and contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity under which alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement 

we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in ways that best optimize our revenues and profitability and reduce our seasonality 

the percentage of our capacity by market is as follows 



mainline 

we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and 20 cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2013  we carried 197 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations and we carry more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the number of passengers carried in 2013  alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage portland and san diego based on 2013  revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles seattlesan diego seattlelas vegas and seattlesan francisco at december 31 2013  alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 131  boeing 737 jet aircraft compared to 124  b737 aircraft as of december 31 2012  

the percentage of mainline passenger capacity by market and average stage length is presented below

regional 

  

our regional operations consist of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2013  our regional operations carried approximately 77 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and represents over 90 of air groups regional revenue passengers 

based on 2013  passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our leading airports are seattle and portland based on revenues in 2013  our leading nonstop routes are seattleportland seattlespokane and seattleboise at december 31 2013  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 51  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft compared to 48  q400s at december 31 2012  horizon flights are listed under alaskas designator code in airline reservation systems and in all customerfacing locations

industry conditions competition and alliances 

  

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive subject to various uncertainties and has historically been characterized by low profit margins uncertainties include general economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2013  the airline industry is expected to report record revenues and profits with passengers topping 3 billion for the first time in history as the industry recovers from the deficits accumulated in the past decade airlines are now moving toward making significant investments in the customer experience to attract demand and thus the level of competition is expected to increase in the future years 

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 21  to 35  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the us 

  

the price of crude oil has ranged from a low of 62  per barrel in 2009  to a high of 112 in 2011 and averaged 98  per barrel in 2013  for us a 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately 11 million  of additional fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 45 million  per year 

 7 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years refining margin prices have fluctuated between 2  per barrel and 50  per barrel in the last five years 

generally west coast aircraft fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting our mainline operation at a competitive disadvantage our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased   4  in 2013  increased 2 in 2012  and increased 36 in 2011  

the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense by crude and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 



 

we use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with the call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts the swap contracts do not require an upfront premium but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period during the second quarter of 2013 we changed the tenor of our hedging program since then we have been hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption compared to 36 months historically additionally we will reach our target of having 50 of consumption hedged 6 months in advance compared to 12 months historically 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet and horizon operates an allbombardier q400 turboprop fleet air groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 726  asmsg in 2009  to 753  asmsg in 2013  these improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport our five principal competitors in order of competitive overlap are delta united southwest american and hawaiian based on schedules filed with the us department of transportation we expect the amount of competitive overlap from these carriers to increase 9 in 2014 we also compete with several other domestic and international carriers but to a lesser extent than our principal competitors 

we believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our customers 

  

   

 

we compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance passenger amenities  including first class seating quality of buyonboard products aircraft type and comfort in 2013  alaska airlines ranked “highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers” by jd power and associates for the sixth  year in a row all of our 2013 mainline aircraft deliveries included the boeing sky interior and the innovative and comfortable recaro seats in 2014 we will continue to improve our inflight experience with our cabin upgrade project featuring the recaro seats with power outlets for every passenger flying our b737800 900 and 900er 

 8 

aircraft additionally flightstatscom has named alaska airlines the no 1 ontime major carrier in north america for each of the past three years 20102012 and as of november 2013 we were the no 1 ontime major carrier in north america for the past 12 months 

 

the pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand 

for example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors in addition legacy carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat empty or full one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares these factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole 

the domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing approximately 85 of total seats accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields we will defend our core markets vigorously and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand we believe the restructuring weve made over the past decade has decreased our costs to the point we can offer low fares while still earning a pretax margin greater than 10 

 

we also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes in order to expand opportunities for our customers we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges these relationships allow us to offer our customers access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our customers more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles in december 2013 we announced that our mileage plan members will be able to earn elite qualifying miles on all of our international parters providing them with even more utility from their membership the mileage plan elitelevel programs include bonus flight miles complimentary upgrades priority checkin and boarding preferred seats discounted airport lounge membership fee waivers and access to exclusive events 

in addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we also compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets in the regional operations both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

agreements with other airlines 

our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements frequent flyer agreements offer reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges for our customers alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our mileage plan members through our frequent flyer partnerships with a number of domestic and international carriers 

codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers the sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement for example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier the interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption 

interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination an interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the 

 9 

fare collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to customers 

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

the comprehensive summary of alliances with other airlines are as follows 



 

 10 

the following is the financial impact of our marketing alliances 



ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have taken steps over the past few years to better manage the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations like hawaii and expanding to cities in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• changes in fuel costs 

  

  11 

  

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and reaccommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2013  we employed 13177   10201  at alaska and 2976  at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 42  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in both 2013  and 2012  

most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition at december 31 2013  labor unions represented 83  of alaska’s and 49  of horizon’s employees our relations with our us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2013  were as follows 

 12 

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2013  were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 

 14 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund amendments and reauthorization act and the oil pollution control act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

we expect there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions alaska and horizon have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties since the september 11 2001 attacks this insurance program excludes coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils so like other airlines the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the us government 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprise wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterpriselevel identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

 15 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protections 

similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local level including increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment minimum wage requirements and health care mandates that could affect our relationship with our workforce and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs 

  

almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers related to higher security costs increased costs related to updated infrastructures and other costs additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 16 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems and information technology infrastructure and services as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future especially since we rely on timely and effective thirdparty performance in conjunction with many of our technologyrelated initiatives in addition in recent years alaska and horizon have subcontracted their heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

  

 

 

   

   

   

 

 

due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly on the west coast therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are 

 17 

unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer 

the airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures since deregulation both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle los angeles anchorage portland hawaii and san diego a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2013  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 61  of our total passengers 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions we are also highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy unfavorable us economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel for some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel businesses are able to forego air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing and the internet or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

 18 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future we routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements frequent flyer program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities if other airlines participate in consolidations or reorganizations those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruptions untimely recovery or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs 

we accept store and transmit information about our customers our employees our business partners and our business in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 34  35  and 34  of total operating expenses for the years ended 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 

certain of our credit facilities and indentures governing our secured borrowings impose certain operating and financial covenants on us such covenants require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios and other negative covenants customary for such financings a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio 

our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and we may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing

our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet 

as of december 31 2013 the average age of our nextgen aircraft b737800 900 900ers was approximately 58  years and the average age of our q400 aircraft was approximately 71  years our relatively new aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future our fleet will require more maintenance as it ages additionally during the current year we modified one of our powerbythehour agreements and terminated another agreement meaning that we could be more susceptible to variances in our maintenance expense due to more expensive scheduled maintenance foreign object damage unplanned engine removal or other unplanned maintenance event any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all customers  

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant improvements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs 

in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of 

key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 42  42  and 41  of our nonfuel operating expenses in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them the same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs that ultimately flowthrough to us 

as of december 31 2013  labor unions represented approximately 83  of alaska’s and 49  of horizon’s employees although we have been successful in maturing communications negotiating approaches and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the companys longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in the companys strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed

year in review 

our 2013  consolidated pretax income was 816 million  compared to 514 million  in 2012  the 302 million  improvement was primarily due to the 499 million  increase in revenues partially offset by the 8 million  increase in aircraft fuel expense and 185 million  increase in other operating expenses our improvement in revenues of 499 million  was partially due to a onetime noncash special mileage plan revenue item of 192 million  related to the accounting for our recently modified affinity card agreement where the accounting rules required us to revalue the deferred revenue associated with miles previously sold to our bank partner with a corresponding benefit to revenue additionally passenger revenue increased 237 million  due to a 68  increase in traffic offset by 08  lower ticket yields the increase in fuel cost was driven by the 59  increase in consumption offset by a 36  decrease in raw cost per gallon the increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increases in wages and incentive pay aircraft maintenance contracted services and other operating expenses as we grew into new markets and increased spending in it and other areas

new markets 

in 2013  we added nonstop routes to our network as follows

we will also add new cities and nonstop routes in 2014  as follows 



update on labor negotiations 

in july 2013 alaska airlines pilots and horizons flight attendants approved new fiveyear contracts 

in december 2013 we reached a tentative fiveyear agreement with alaskas flight attendants represented by the association of flight attendants afa which if approved will provide the company and our employees the certainty that comes with a longterm deal the results of voting are due february 14 2014 

in february 2014 we reached a tentative fiveyear agreement with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam on terms of a new contract for alaskas clerical operations and passenger services employees whose contract became amendable january 1 2014 horizons maintenance store employees represented by the iam continue to work towards their first contract 

capital allocation 

in 2013  we repurchased 2492093  shares of our common stock for 159 million  under the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors since 2007 we have repurchased 21 million  shares of common stock under such programs for 478 million  for an average price of approximately 23  per share additionally starting in the third quarter and for the first time since 1992 we paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling 28 million  in 2013  

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run safe compliant and reliable operations at our airlines in addition to our primary objective we will remain focused on providing a hasslefree experience for our customers and building a compelling brand to support network growth specifically we will continue to improve our inflight experience with our cabin upgrade project featuring the recaro seats with power outlets for every passenger flying our b737800 900 and 900er aircraft 

our biggest concern going forward is increased competition in our markets from both traditional and lowcost competitors specifically delta air lines is significantly increasing its international and domestic departures in seattle we plan to vigorously defend our markets through mileage plan promotions schedule changes community events and similar responses we also continue to focus on lowering unit costs in the longterm so that we can compete more effectively and increasing fuel efficiency by replacing older 737400 and 737700 aircraft with larger 737900er aircraft

in january 2014 our load factors were down 03 pts compared to january 2013 our advance bookings suggest our load factors will be down   1 pt  in february  and 3 pts  in march  compared to the same periods in 2013  our current expectations for capacity and operating costs per asm are summarized below 



results   of operations 

  

2013  compared with 2012   

our consolidated net income for 2013  was 508 million  or 716  per diluted share compared to net income of 316 million  or 440  per diluted share in 2012  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

adjusted nongaap results and   pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of marktomarket gains or losses or other individual revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

excluding the impact of marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments and the onetime special mileage plan revenue item our adjusted consolidated net income for 2013  was 383 million  or 540  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 339 million  or 473  per share in 2012

operating statistics summary unaudited 

alaska air group inc 

below are operating statistics we use to measure performance we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which is a nongaap measure 



 

 31 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   499 million  or 11  during 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2013   increased  by 6  on a 79   increase  in capacity and a 15   decrease  in prasm compared to 2012  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2013  and larger aircraft the decrease  in prasm was driven by a 09   decrease  in ticket yield and a 05 point   decrease  in load factor compared to the prior year increased competition in the state of alaska and along the west coast put downward pressures on yield and load factor 

due to increased competitive capacity in our markets we expect pressure on unit revenues while we expect total passenger revenue to increase 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 31 million  or 4  compared to 2012  on a 04   increase  in capacity and 37   increase  in prasm compared to 2012  the increase  in prasm was due to a 14   increase  in ticket yield coupled with a 18 point   increase  in load factor compared to the prior year the increase in regional revenues is due to better matching the right aircraft with the right market to avoid oversupply of capacity and maintaining yields and load factors 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased   2 million  or 2  primarily due to increased freight volumes 

other – net 

other—net revenue increased   68 million  or 13  from 2012  this is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan revenues of 47 million  or 22  as a result of a higher rate per mile sold to bank of america corporation bac under our new affinity card program and growth in the mileage plan program additionally bag fees increased by 78  and change fees increased by 73  due to increases in the number of passengers we expect increases in other revenue will outpace increases in passenger revenue on a percentage basis in 2014 as we continue to see the benefit from the new affinity card agreement and the increase in bag and change fees implemented in late 2013 

special mileage plan revenue 

in the third quarter we modified and extended our cobranded credit card agreement with bac in connection with this agreement and as a result of applying related accounting standards we recorded a onetime noncash special mileage plan revenue item of 192 million primarily related to our revaluation of the deferred revenue liability related to miles previously sold to bac 

 32 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   193 million  or 5  compared to 2012  primarily driven by wages and variable incentive pay fuel expense remained flat due to decrease in fuel cost per gallon offset by an increase in fuel consumption we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2012  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2013  by 48 million  or 5  compared to 2012  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   6  primarily due to a newly ratified contract with alaskas pilots that was effective april 1 2013 additionally we hired 2   more ftes to support increased flying and other strategic initiatives such as it and hasslefree projects 

pension expense decreased   12  compared to the same period in the prior year the decline is due to having a lower accumulated loss to amortize as a result of higher plan assets and improved funded status compared to the prior year 

medical benefits increased   5  from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee healthcare claims and an increase in the cost of health care services 

we expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2014  compared to 2013  on a 3 to 4 increase in ftes partially offset by reduced pension expense of approximately 40 million as a result of having higher plan assets and a higher discount rate related to our benefit obligation 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  from 88 million  in 2012  to 105 million  in 2013  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year 

we expect variable incentive pay in 2014 to be similar to amounts recorded over the past three years 

 33 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense increased   8 million  or 1  compared to 2012  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 59  in line with the increase in departures and capacity 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon decreased 36  as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2013  was due to a decline in refining margins of 267  offset by the increase in average crude oil prices of 41  as compared to the prior year 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from or pay to hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were 52 million  in 2013  compared to losses of 24 million  in 2012  these amounts represent the cash received or paid net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 50  lower in the first  quarter of 2014  than the first  quarter of 2013  due to lower west coast jet fuel prices and the decrease in premium costs related to our fuel hedge program as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance increased  by 25 million  or 11  compared to the prior year primarily due to a 14 million  increase in lease return provisions during the year we modified one of our powerbythehour agreements and terminated another related to our b737 fleet resulting in a decrease in expense under those agreements but an increase in engine events and related expense that we are now responsible for for our b737 and q400 fleets we also experienced heavier more expensive checks on flat volumes 

we expect aircraft maintenance to be slightly lower in 2014  due to lower lease return expenses and the benefits of changes made to our powerbythehour agreements 

 34 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   19 million  or 8  primarily due to the increase in rates from the newly signed port of seattle lease additionally we experienced increased rates throughout our network with increased departures and passengers 

we expect landing fees and other rentals to be higher in 2014  due to expected increases in rates departures and passengers 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   21 million  or 11  primarily due to more capacity purchase flying with skywest and higher rates with penair additionally we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling costs and other services as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used 

we expect contracted services to be higher in 2014  to handle expected growth in the number of passengers and transition costs associated with changing the ground handling vendor at a number of our locations 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 11 million  or 7  compared to 2012  as a result of higher commissions with credit cards and interline commissions related to international routes 

we expect selling expense will be higher in 2014  primarily due to increased advertising and promotional activities related to our brand refresh and revenuerelated costs 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   30 million  or 12  compared to 2012  the increase is driven by a variety of factors such as higher professional fees it costs losses on the disposal of assets property taxes and new uniforms 

we expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2014  due to an expected increase in it spending and higher professional service costs 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense increased   4 million  from 2012  this is due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier these three aircraft will be operated by skywest under a cpa partially offsetting the sublease loss was a gain on the sale of equity securities 

 35 

operating costs per available seat mile 

additionally we are presenting our lineitem expenses below both in absolute dollars and on an asm basis to highlight areas in 

which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity 



additional segment information 

refer to the notes of the condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a 

summary of each segments profitability 

alaska mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 530 million  in 2013  compared to 466 million  in 2012  the 206 million  increase in mainline passenger revenue is described previously as well as the increased revenues from the modified credit card agreement mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by 162 million  driven mainly by increased wages and incentive pay landing fees and rents due to increased rates and volumes and other expenses to support our growth in operations economic fuel cost as defined above increased due to a 68  increase in consumption on a slight decrease in the economic price per gallon 

alaska regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 69 million  in 2013  compared to 62 million  in 2012  the 31 million  increase in alaska regional passenger revenue is described previously alaska regional expenses were slightly higher due to additional flying by skywest and higher rates from penair and increased landing fees and rents due to increased flying and higher rates also impacting pretax profit is the 12 million loss due to the overhaul and repair of three aircraft that were previously subleased to another carrier 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 20 million  in 2013  compared to 24 million  in 2012  cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation decreased due to lower operational incentives being met the 3 million  increase in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was driven by wages and incentive pay and an increase in airframe checks and other unscheduled events 

 36 

2012  compared with 2011 

our consolidated net income for 2012  was 316 million  or 440  per diluted share compared to net income of 245 million  or 333  per diluted share in 2011  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods were as follows 

 

 

excluding the marktomarket adjustments and other special charges our adjusted consolidated net income for 2012  was 339 million  or 473  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 287 million  or 392  per share in 2011  



our operating costs per asm are summarized below

 37 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased 339 million  or 8  during 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2012   increased  by 10  on a 63 increase in capacity and a 32 increase in prasm compared to 2011  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2012  most of which were to and from hawaii the increase in prasm was driven by a 14 rise in ticket yield and a 14point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the increase in yield was due to strong demand throughout 2012 while the increase in load factor was due to adding more traffic in our high density markets 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 33 million  or 5  compared to 2011  on a 44 increase in capacity and flat prasm compared to 2011  prasm was affected by a 11 decrease in ticket yield offset by a 12point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the decrease in yield was due to increased competition in certain markets while the increase in load factor was due to better matching of supply with demand 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased   2 million  or 2  primarily due to higher freight volumes and an increase in fuel and security charges which offset a decrease in mail volumes 

other – net 

other – net revenue increased   15 million  or 3  from 2011  this is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan revenues of 7 and buyonboard sales of 20 buyonboard improved due to an increase in food sales of 24 and beverage sales of 14 the increases were partially offset by a decrease in bag fees of 2 due to general shifts in customer behavior and our club 49 program that launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 which waives the checked bag fee for residents in the state of alaska who have joined the program 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   256 million  or 7  compared to 2011  mostly as a result of higher fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2011  are more fully described below 

 38 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2012  by 47 million  or 5  compared to 2011  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   3  on a 1 increase in ftes as a result of increased flying and higher wage rates throughout our different employee groups which have wage step increases in their contracts the contracts with the different employee groups contain important productivity improvements which resulted in a 35 increase in the number of passengers handled per fte 

pension and other retirementrelated benefits increased   36  primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate on the future benefit obligation compared to the prior year and a reduction in the expected return on plan assets the impact of lower rates resulted in an increase in our pension expense 

medical benefits increased   5  from the prior year primarily due to an increase in the cost of healthcare somewhat offset by lower employee claims and an increase in workers compensation expense partially offset by a decline in postretirement medical expense 

payroll taxes increased   2  from the prior year in line with increased wages 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  from 72 million  in 2011  to 88 million  in 2012  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense increased   161 million  or 12  compared to 2011  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 60 in line with the increase in departures and block hours 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased 22 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices the increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2012 was due to the increase in refining margins of 103 offset by the decrease in average crude oil prices of 13 as compared to the prior year 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year was 24 million in 2012  compared to gains of 21 million in 2011  

 39 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance increased  by 16 million  or 8  compared to the prior year primarily due to a 13 million increase in unscheduled engine removals for our q400 aircraft and an 8 million increase related to our 737800 aircraft related to heavier airframe checks offset by a 12 million decrease due to lighter airframe checks for our 737400 aircraft 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent was flat compared to the prioryear period primarily due to lower rent expense of 3 million for 13 fewer crj700 aircraft and three b737400 aircraft lease extensions of 2 million offset by additional rent expense for three b737700 aircraft which were sold and leased back for 3 million 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   5 million  or 2  primarily due to higher facilities rents of 5 million and increased landing fees of 4 million due to increased departures of 18 these increases were partially offset by lower rents at lax of 8 million 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   15 million  or 8  primarily due to an increase in passengers of 45 and capacity purchase flying of 13 million related to skywest which began in may 2011 additionally we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling of 2 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used 

selling expenses 

selling expenses decreased  by 7 million  or 4  compared to 2011  as a result of lower fees related to debit card purchases of 4 million and flat global distribution system gds fees offset by an increase in advertising and promotional activities of 2 million 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 17 million  or 7  compared to the prior year this is primarily due to additional depreciation expense for the annualization of b737 aircraft and q400 aircraft delivered in 2011 as well as the deliveries of b737 aircraft in 2012 in addition we incurred depreciation of 6 million related to terminal 6 at lax which was put into service in march 2012 these increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation expense for the crj700 aircraft removed from the fleet in 2011 and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage costs increased   12 million  or 18  from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers of 45 increase in sales of buyonboard products of 20 offset by the higher cost of some of our premium products served on board and increased costs associated with food delivery 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   13 million  or 6  compared to 2011  the increase is primarily driven by higher it and professional service costs of 8 million associated with our key initiatives and infrastructure improvements and higher personnel nonwage costs such as hotels meals and per diems of 7 million 

fleet transition and restructuring related expenses 

fleet transition costs decreased   39 million  as we completed our transition to an allq400 fleet at horizon in 2011 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense decreased 37 million from 2011 this is due to lower interest expense of 13 million on lower average outstanding debt balances and additional capitalized interest due to higher levels of aircraft purchase deposits and 

 40 

capital expenditures additionally we incurred prepayment penalties of 8 million and an impairment charge of 6 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection in the prior year the decrease was partially offset by lower interest income earned on our marketable securities portfolio

refer to the notes of the condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment below is a 

summary of each segments profitability 

alaska mainline 

pretax profit for alaska mainline was 466 million in 2012 compared to 375 million in 2011 the 289 million increase in mainline passenger revenue is described previously mainline operating expense excluding fuel increased by 162 million driven mainly by increased wages and incentive pay depreciation expense food and beverage expense and other expenses to support our growth in operations economic fuel cost as defined above increased due to an 64 increase in consumption and an increase economic price per gallon 

alaska regional 

pretax profit for alaska regional was 62 million in 2012 compared to 68 million in 2011 the 33 million increase in alaska regional passenger revenue is described previously alaska regional expenses were higher due to additional flying by skywest which began flying in may 2011 

horizon 

pretax profit for horizon was 24 million in 2012 compared to 22 million in 2011 cpa revenues 100 of which are from alaska and eliminated in consolidation were flat with the prior year the 2 million decrease in horizons nonfuel operating expenses was driven by cost savings as more overhead expense was transitioned under the cpa arrangement partially offset by higher engine maintenance costs in the secondhalf of 2012

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

in 2013  we took free and clear delivery of nine b737900er and three q400 aircraft we made scheduled debt payments totaling 161 million  in addition we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing 159 million  of our common stock in 2013  and paid dividends totaling 28 million finally we made voluntary contributions to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 83 million  in 2013  although there were no funding requirements we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

the overall strength of our balance sheet was one of the contributing factors for standard  poors recent decision to upgrade our credit rating from bb to bb with a stable outlook 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



   

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

cash from operation increased approximately 228 million  due to an increase in revenues excluding special mileage plan revenue item of approximately 300 million an increase in cash receipts related to our mileage plan program of approximately 130 million due to growth in the program and an increase in the rate paid per mile an approximately 60 million savings in fuel hedges as we changed our program to purchase calls out of the money and shortened the tenor of our program and approximately 30 million less in pension contributions partially offsetting these increases were additional cash paid in taxes of approximately 80 million an increase in operating expenses to support the growth in revenues of approximately 115 million an increase wages and incentive pay of 65 million and an increase fuel costs of 25 million 

 42 

cash provided by operating activities was 753 million  in 2012  compared to 696 million  in 2011  the 57 million increase was primarily driven by 339 million in increased revenue offset by higher fuel of 161 million as well as higher nonfuel operating costs to support increased revenues and capacity in addition cash received from the sale of miles under our mileage plan program increased approximately 30 million due a 5 increase in miles sold with a 4 increase in rate in 2012 we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan of 110 million versus 133 million in the prior year and we paid cash taxes of 78 million in 2012 compared to 8 million in 2011 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 698 million  during 2013  compared to 645 million  in 2012  our capital expenditures were 566 million  or 48 million  higher than in 2012  this is due to the delivery of nine b737900er aircraft and three q400 aircraft compared to four b737900er aircraft three b737800 aircraft and two q400 aircraft in the prior year 

we now have firm commitments for 69  b737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 62  additional 737 nextgen ng aircraft and max aircraft in 2015  through 2024  the options for both ng and max aircraft will give alaska the flexibility but not the obligation to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met the new agreements will result in increased capital spending over the next ten years depending on how many of our options are exercised 

the table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised as of february 13 2014  these options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met 



 

cash used in investing activities was 645 million during 2012 compared to 403 million in 2011 our capital expenditures were 518 million or 131 million higher than in 2011 this is due to the delivery of four b737900er aircraft three b737800 aircraft and two q400 aircraft compared to three b737800 aircraft in the prior year as well as purchase deposits for the ten b737900er aircraft to be delivered in 2014 and initial deposits related to our new boeing agreements 

in 2012 we entered into a new agreement and modified existing agreements with boeing to acquire 50 737 aircraft including 37 of boeings new 737 max aircraft this order positions alaska to replace aging aircraft over the next decade including the phase out of nearly all of its 737400 aircraft by the end of 2017 and continue to operate one of the most modern environmentally friendly comfortable and fuelefficient fleets in the united states 

cash used by financing activities 

  

cash used by financing activities was 325 million  during 2013  compared to 88 million  in 2012  during the current year we had scheduled debt payments of 161 million  stock repurchases of 159 million  and cash dividend payments of 28 million  in 2012  we made debt payments of 275 million  stock repurchases of 60 million  and received 178 million  in t6 lax reimbursement in 2011 we made debt payments of 334 million  and stock repurchases of 80 million which was offset by proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 106 million 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing if necessary

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

the company has two 100 million credit facilities both facilities have variable interest rates based on libor plus a specified margin borrowings on one of the 100 million  facilities which expires in august 2015  are secured by aircraft borrowings on the other 100 million  facility are secured by certain accounts receivable spare engines spare parts and ground service equipment we modified the first facility in 2012  by extending the term from march 2013  to august 2015  and the second facility in 2013  by extending the term from march 2016  to march 2017  and reduced the commitment fee for both facilities the company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

overall we have firm orders to purchase 69  aircraft we have options to acquire 62  additional b737 aircraft and options to acquire 7  q400 aircraft 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments by year as of february 13 2014  



for future firm orders and if we exercise our options for additional deliveries we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

we use both call options for crude oil forwards and swap agreements for jet fuel refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption we have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50  of our first  quarter 2014  estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 70 cents  per gallon our crude oil positions are as follows 



 44 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2013  



 

defined benefit pensions 

our qualified definedbenefit pension plans were overfunded by 60 million  at december 31 2013  compared to a 335 million  unfunded liability at december 31 2012  this results in a 104  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 82  funded as of december 31 2012  considering the funded status of the plans we do not plan on making any material pension contributions in 2014 

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets as measured by value are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices level of pension funding which is generally not known until late each year whether bonus depreciation provisions are available as well as other legislative changes that are out of our control 

in 2013  we made tax payments of 149 million  and had an effective tax rate of 377  in 2014  we expect to pay more in cash tax payments however this is highly dependent on actual taxable income and other factors that are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda are based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

for miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future for miles sold to third parties the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered and the remaining components are recorded as commission in othernet revenue in the period the miles are sold commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was 213 million  143 million  and 138 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines or expire and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2013  we had approximately 137 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 656 million  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in these estimates therefore different assumptions could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

   

we defer sales proceeds under two accounting methodologies the relative selling price method which represents approximately 94 of sold miles and the residual accounting method which represents the remaining 6 for contracts that were modified after the effective date of accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 200913 we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to the estimated selling price of comparable travel discounted cash flows brand value published selling prices number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed we estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables this relative allocation does not change over the term of the agreements 

for remaining contracts which continue to be accounted for under the residual method as our estimates of selling price change the amount we defer changes resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period a 10 increase in the estimated selling price of travel and related deferral rate would decrease commission revenue by an immaterial amount this amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place 

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage consider historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors in 2013  as part of the modification of our affinity card agreement we reevaluated the breakage rate based on a statistical analysis of historical data which refined our estimate of the amount of 

 46 

breakage in the mileage population this new refinement enabled us to better identify historical differences between certain of our mileage breakage estimates and the amounts that have actually been experienced as a result we increased our estimate of the number of miles expected to expire unused from 12 to 174 the effect of the 54 change in the breakage estimate was approximately 44 million included as part of the special mileage plan revenue item and approximately 7 million for the second half of 2013 included in othernet revenue a hypothetical 1 change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a 5 million effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical award redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

pension plans 

  

accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the changes in funded status in other comprehensive income pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 50 million  57 million  and 42 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we expect the 2014  expense to be approximately 9 million  as a result of the improvement in the funded status of our plans 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate increases we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 485  and 395  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the discount rate at december 31 2013  was determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans the increase in the discount rate is due to the rising interest rate environment as the economy improves from the recent recession if the economy were to face unfavorable conditions and the discount rate decreased by 05  from 485  to 435  we would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2013  by approximately 118 million  and increase our estimated 2014  pension expense by approximately 8 million  

pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2013  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 675  which decreased 05 from the rate at december 31 2012  the decrease in rate is due to the shift of our pension asset portfolio into more fixed income 

 47 

investments that better match the cash flows of our expected benefit payments and reduce the volatility of future returns we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2013  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixedincome securities a decrease in the expected longterm rate of return of 05  from 675  to 625  would increase our estimated 2014  pension expense by approximately 9 million  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans were frozen january 1 2014 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 39 billion  of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with the call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts the swap contracts do not require an upfront premium but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2013  would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio by approximately 27 million  and 12 million  respectively 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 16  million at december 31 2013  compared to a portfolio value of 64  million at december 31 2012  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2013  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see the derivative instruments note in our consolidated financial statements 

  

 48 

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2013  would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 1 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements our variablerate debt is approximately 19  of our total longterm debt at december 31 2013  compared to 18  at december 31 2012  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2013  interest income would increase by approximately 14 million

we want to be the easiest airline to fly which we will do by improving each step of the customers journey from booking a ticket to our inflight experience during 2012 we launched a new mobile website malaskaaircom which provides customers quick and easy access to important travel information from any handheld mobile device or tablet including the ability to purchase tickets track flight details checkin get mobile boarding passes and view optional upgrades after the successful launch of booking on our mobile website we upgraded our android app in december 2012 and iphone app in january 2013 to allow our customers to book tickets using our apps we introduced selfbag tagging to four locations in 2012 which allows customers to print and attach their own luggage tags from a selfservice kiosk in the airport lobby or as part of a pilot program at home during web checkin the transportation security administration tsa launched their precheck program in 17 of our locations which allows eligible customers to optin for reduced screening requirements as passengers take more control of their travel experience we are able to reduce the time it takes a customer to move from the airport curb to the aircraft 

we have also made improvements to our airport gate areas at los angeles international airport lax alaska moved to a newly renovated terminal 6 which includes our airport of the future design new common use systems additional gates and convenient connections with international flights at seattletacoma international airport seatac the port of seattle commission gave final design authorization to renovate the north satellite to better serve passengers and consolidate our operations the project will include modernizing facilities enhanced traveler amenities adding three gates and building a new rooftop boardroom we also enhanced the customer experience by adding more power outlets to gate areas at six airport locations we expect construction on this project to commence in late 2013 

we continued to improve our inflight experience by taking delivery of our first b737 aircraft with the boeing sky interior the interior includes variable ambient cabin lighting larger window recesses and overhead bins which provide more headroom all designed to offer a greater sense of space all future b737 aircraft deliveries will include the boeing sky interior 

energetic and compelling brand 

we are fortunate to have high brand awareness and customer loyalty in the pacific northwest and alaska for us to keep growing in new markets like california hawaii and cities in the midcontinental and eastern us we believe we must better understand what is important to our new customers and position our brand appropriately to help differentiate us from the competition we use our brand and technology to develop more direct relationships with our customers through more personalized marketing our website alaskaaircom is tailored to each customer based on their location and viewing history in 2012 approximately 54  of our ticket sales were made through alaskaaircom and our goal is 60 in 2013 similarly our email marketing is highly targeted and personalized by allowing customers to choose which types of messages they want to receive such as fare sale new markets offers from partner airlines and monthly mileage plan activity as a result we increase ticket sales and reduce our ticket distribution costs by providing the right marketing messages to the right people at the right time 

we use social platforms such as facebook and twitter to give customers a new way to connect with our brand and provide exceptional customer service throughout their journey in 2012 our facebook fans grew by 47 and our twitter followers increased 38 and as we expand our network we are dedicated to becoming part of the communities we serve in 2012 employees participated in over 235 community events including the spirit of the islands painttheplane contest with the winning artwork adorning one of our b737800 aircraft we also sponsor a number of local teams in the cities we serve such as the seattle mariners and portland timbers 

low fares low costs and network growth 

in order to profitably provide low fares to our customers while returning value to our shareholders we believe we must maintain a competitive cost structure in 2012 we lowered our unit costs excluding fuel by 08 on a consolidated basis representing the 10th such annual reduction out of the past 11 years we achieved this through a continued focus on productivity in 2012  we increased employee productivity by 35  and will continue to focus on that metric through several tools as we leverage growth we also continue to reduce fuel costs by flying fuelefficient aircraft which have reduced our fuel burn as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 134  over the last five years and by decreasing our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices through our fuel hedge program looking forward we have committed to purchasing 34  737900er and 37  737 max aircraft with deliveries in 2013  to 2022  to position us for growth and ensure we will continue to operate the quietest and most fuelefficient aircraft available for the foreseeable future 

in 2012  we added 21 new markets to our network and exited six as we continued to better match supply with demand we diversified our network further to offer more utility to our customers by adding flights to hawaii and expanding to cities in the midcontinental and eastern us such as kansas city san antonio and philadelphia we will also add new routes from seattle to salt lake city and san diego to boston and lihue in 2013  

air group 

alaska air group is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of alaska airlines and horizon air although alaska and horizon both operate as airlines their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 horizon was acquired by air group in 1986 alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets mainline and contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity under which alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement 

we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in a way that best optimizes our revenues and profitability reduces our seasonality and takes advantage of demand in areas where other carriers have either exited or dont have the ability to serve 

the percentage of our capacity by market is as follows 



mainline 

we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and 17 cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2012  we carried 19 million  revenue passengers in our mainline operations and we carry more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the number of passengers carried in 2012  alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2012  revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles seattlelas vegas and seattlesan diego at december 31 2012  alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 124  boeing 737 jet aircraft compared to 117  aircraft as of december 31 2011  

the percentage of mainline passenger traffic by market and average stage length is presented below 



regional 

  

our regional operations consists of flights operated by horizon skywest and penair in 2012  our regional operations carried approximately 7 million  revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and represented over 90 of air groups regional revenue passengers during 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

based on 2012  passenger enplanements on regional aircraft our leading airports are seattle and portland based on revenues in 2012  our leading nonstop routes are seattleportland seattlespokane and seattleboise at december 31 2012  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 48  bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under alaskas designator code in airline reservation systems and in all customerfacing locations 

  

the percentage of regional passenger traffic by market and average stage length is presented below 



industry conditions competition and alliances 

  

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive subject to various uncertainties and has historically been characterized by low profit margins uncertainties include general economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

in 2012  the industry continued to exercise capacity discipline due to economic uncertainty and volatile fuel prices this allowed the industry to report stronger adjusted pretax profit margins compared to 2011  

  

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of aircraft fuel the cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 21  to 36  of operating expenses fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the us 

  

the price of crude oil spiked in 2008  with a high of nearly 150  per barrel in july 2008  and dropped significantly to an average of 62  per barrel in 2009  we saw upward pressure on fuel prices again with an average crude oil price of just over 80  per barrel in 2010  95  per barrel in 2011  and 94  per barrel in 2012  for us a 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately 10 million  of additional fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 4 million  per year 

refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the overall price volatility in recent years refining margin prices reached a high of 45  per barrel in may 2008  before they dropped to an average price of 10 per barrel in 2009  and 14  a barrel in 2010  refining margin prices more than doubled to 33  a barrel in 2011  and increased again to 36  a barrel in 2012 

generally west coast aircraft fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting our mainline operation at a slight competitive disadvantage our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 2  in 2012  36 in 2011  and 27 in 2010  

the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense by crude and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses 



 

we use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with the call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts the swap contracts do not require an upfront premium but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period 

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet and horizon operates an allq400 turboprop fleet alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 726  asmsg in 2008 to 766  asmsg in 2012  these reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes including both major legacy carriers and lowcost carriers due to its shorthaul markets our regional operations occasionally compete with ground transportation in many markets both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

alliances with other airlines 

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as codesharing on certain flights as shown in the table below alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation american airlines and delta air lines are our primary codeshare partners they participate in two of the three major global alliances 

our marketing alliances with other airlines are as follows 



 

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have taken steps over the past few years to better respond to the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations like hawaii and expanding to cities in the midcontinental and eastern us 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• pricing initiatives by us or our competitors 

  

   

   

   

   

many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and reaccommodate displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

11 

employees 

  

our business is labor intensive as of december 31 2012 we employed 12932   9954  at alaska and 2978  at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 42  and 41  of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2012  and 2011  respectively 

  

most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition new entrants into the us airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces and often have lower costs and more liberal work rules at december 31 2012  labor unions represented 83  of alaska’s and 49  of horizon’s employees our relations with our us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2012  were as follows 



horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2012  were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

environmental and occupational safety matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund amendments and reauthorization act and the oil pollution control act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and 

health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

we expect there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions alaska and horizon have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets thereby greatly reducing our total emissions 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

insurance 

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties since the september 11 2001 attacks this insurance program excludes coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils so like other airlines the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the us government 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprise wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with board oversight these enterpriselevel identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public andor aviation authorities we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related 

insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protections similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems and information technology infrastructure and services as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future especially since we rely on timely and effective thirdparty performance in conjunction with many of our technologyrelated initiatives in addition in recent years alaska and horizon have subcontracted their heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

  

   

   

   

 

 

due to our concentration of flights in the pacific northwest and alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares some of our competitors have lower costs than we do and compete directly against us in our markets we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles hawaii and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2012  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 61  of our total passengers 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the recent us and global economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for air travel while some economic indicators are showing signs of growth unemployment remains high in some of our key markets given that the strength of the us and global economies have an impact on the demand for air travel a longterm economic slump could result in a need to adjust our capacity plans which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems 

contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruptions untimely recovery or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs 

we accept store and transmit information about our customers our employees our business partners and our business in addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks a compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 35  34  and 27  of total operating expenses for the years ended 2012  2011   and 2010  respectively future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

the outcome of the resolution process and any subsequent challenge through which new lease terms at seatac will be set cannot be predicted with certainty 

our lease with the port of seattle for terminal space at seattletacoma international airport expired on december 31 2012 negotiations for a new lease have thus far been unsuccessful absent a negotiated lease federal law requires the port to set new rates by means of a resolution the company and other seatac carriers may accept the new resolution or ask the dot to set them aside as unreasonable under federal law the resolution process and any subsequent challenge by us or other airlines will not interrupt our tenancy at seatac 

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 

our definedbenefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk if market returns are poor in the future or if interest rates used to discount our future obligation decrease any future obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity poor market returns or low interest rates could lead to higher pension expense in our consolidated statements of operations the calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “critical accounting estimates” and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

aviation insurers could increase their premiums in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through december 31 2013 although the government may again extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

brand and reputation 

as we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all customers  

  

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts could include significant improvements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs 

if in pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base which could result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of 

key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 42  41  and 43  of our nonfuel operating expenses in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them 

as of december 31 2012  labor unions represented approximately 83  of alaska’s and 49  of horizon’s employees although we have been successful in maturing communications negotiating approaches and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the companys longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in the companys strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed

year in review 

our 2012  consolidated pretax income was 514 million  compared to 394 million  in 2011  the 120 million  improvement was primarily due to the 339 million  increase in revenues partially offset by the 161 million  increase in aircraft fuel expense and 95 million  increase in other operating expenses our improvement in revenues was primarily due to a 79  increase in traffic and a 07  increase in yield the increase in fuel cost was driven by the 22  increase in raw cost per gallon on a 60  increase in consumption

update on labor negotiations 

in july 2012 our ramp and stores agents represented by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam ratified a sixyear contract by a 91 margin before the amendable date the contract provides for an initial wage increase of 25 followed by 15 annual increases over the sixyear term and contains important productivity improvements it also offers both the company and our employees the certainty that comes with a longterm deal 

in december 2012 we entered into a sixyear agreement with horizons pilot union represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt for an extension of their contract through december 2018 the deal is mutually beneficial to both the company and our pilots and calls for a signing bonus wage step increases and productivity gains over the term of the contract we also ratified a threeyear agreement with horizons station personnel in vancouver and victoria represented by the national automobile aerospace transportation and general workers in january 2013 

we are currently in negotiations with alaskas and horizons flight attendants represented by the association of flight attendants afa whose contracts became amendable in april 2012 and december 2011 respectively in addition we are in early discussions with alaskas pilots represented by the airline pilots association alpa whose contract is amendable in april 2013 we are also in negotiations with horizons maintenance store employees represented by iam 

stock repurchase 

in 2012 we repurchased 1685951  shares of our common stock for 60 million  under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors since 2007 we have repurchased 18 million  shares of common stock under such programs for 320 million  for an average price of approximately 17  per share 

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run safe compliant and reliable operations at our airlines in addition to our primary objective we will remain focused on providing a hasslefree experience for our customers specifically we plan to enhance mobile features and expand our selfbag tagging capabilities additionally as part of our strategy of enhancing our brand we are considering ways to enhance the onboard experience such as seats cabin layout seat power and inflight entertainment 

our biggest concerns going forward are increased competition in our markets particularly lowcost competitors and our unsigned labor agreements our goal is to sign labor agreements prior to the amendable date to to avoid the negative impacts of prolonged negotiations and provide our employees with the longterm stability that helps promote higher customer satisfaction to combat lowcost competitors we took delivery of four  b737900er aircraft in 2012 and will take delivery of an additional nine  in 2013 which will provide additional efficiencies in fuel consumption and overall unit cost reductions 

our advance bookings suggest our load factors will be up   05 pts  in february  and flat  in march  compared to the same periods in 2012  on an expected 85  increase in capacity for the first  quarter of 2013  

results   of operations 

  

2012  compared with 2011   

our consolidated net income for 2012  was 316 million  or 440  per diluted share compared to net income of 245 million  or 333  per diluted share in 2011  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

adjusted nongaap results and   pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because 

 26 

 

 

 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

excluding the marktomarket adjustments and other special charges our adjusted consolidated net income for 2012  was 339 million  or 473  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 287 million  or 392  per share in 2011  



operating statistics summary unaudited 

alaska air group inc 

below are operating statistics we use to measure operating performance we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which is a nongaap measure 



 

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased   339 million  or 8  during 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2012   increased  by 10  on a 63   increase  in capacity and a 32   increase  in prasm compared to 2011  the increase in capacity was driven by new routes added in 2012  most of which were to and from hawaii the increase  in prasm was driven by a 14   increase  in ticket yield and a 14point   increase  in load factor compared to the prior year the increase  in yield is due to strong demand throughout the year while the increase in load factor is due to adding more traffic in our high density markets 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 33 million  or 5  compared to 2011  on a 44   increase  in capacity and flat prasm compared to 2011  prasm was affected by a 11   decrease  in ticket yield offset by a 12point   increase  in load factor compared to the prior year the decrease  in yield is due to increased competition in certain markets while the increase  in load factor is due to better matching of supply with demand 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased   2 million  or 2  primarily due to higher freight volumes and an increase in fuel and security surcharges which offset a decrease in mail volumes 

other – net 

other—net revenue increased   15 million  or 3  from 2011  this is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan revenues of 7  and buyonboard sales of 20  buyonboard improved due to an increase in food sales of 24  and beverage sales of 14  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bag fees of 2  due to general shifts in customer behavior and our club 49 program that launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 which waives the checked bag fee for residents in the state of alaska who have joined the program 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   256 million  or 7  compared to 2011  mostly as a result of higher fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2011  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2012  by 47 million  or 5  compared to 2011  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   3  on a 1   increase  in ftes as a result of increased flying and higher wage rates throughout our different employee groups which have wage step increase in their contracts the contracts with the different employee groups contain important productivity improvements which resulted in a 35   increase  in the number of passengers handled per fte 

pension and other retirementrelated benefits increased   17  primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate on the future benefit obligation compared to the prior year the impact of lower rates resulted in an increase in our pension expense 

medical benefits increased   1  from the prior year primarily due to an increase in employee healthcare claims partially offset by a decline in postretirement medical expense 

other benefits and payroll taxes increased   9  from the prior year due to increased workers compensation expense of 4 million  as a result of higher loss rates in more recent claim years and increased stockbased compensation of 4 million  

we expect wages and benefits to be 6 to 7 higher in 2013  compared to 2012  on a 3 to 4 increase in ftes as well as inflation in medical benefits of 10 pension and other retirementrelated benefits is expected to be flat compared to 2012  

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased  from 72 million  in 2011  to 88 million  in 2012  the increase is due to actual results exceeding our target results of financial and operational performance more so than in the prior year 

if we meet targets established under our performance based pay and operational performance rewards programs we expect variable incentive pay will be approximately 60 million  in 2013  if we exceed the targets variable incentive pay will be higher if we do not achieve targets it will be lower 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense increased   161 million  or 12  compared to 2011  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 60  in line with the increase in departures and block hours 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased 22  as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the increase in raw fuel price per gallon during 2012  was due to the increase in refining margins of 103  offset by the decrease in crude oil of 13  as compared to the prior year 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from or pay to hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year was 24 million  in 2012  compared to gains of 21 million  in 2011  these amounts represent the cash received net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 3  higher in the first  quarter of 2013  than the first  quarter of 2012  due to the increased premium costs related to our fuel hedge program as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance increased  by 16 million  or 8  compared to the prior year primarily due to a 13 million  increase in unscheduled engine removals for our q400 aircraft and an 8 million  increase related to our 737800 aircraft related to heavier airframe checks offset by a 12 million  decrease due to lighter airframe checks for our 737400 aircraft 

we expect aircraft maintenance to be approximately 10 higher in 2013  due to an increase in lease return costs and scheduled maintenance events for our b737 aircraft offset by lower maintenance costs for our q400 aircraft 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent was flat compared to the prioryear period primarily due to lower rent expense for 13  fewer crj 700 aircraft of 3 million  and three  b737400 aircraft lease extensions of 2 million  offset by additional rent expense for three  b737700 aircraft which were sold and leased back of 3 million  

we expect aircraft rent to be flat in 2013  as we intend to return six b737 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2013 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   5 million  or 2  primarily due to higher facilities rents of 5 million  and increased landing fees of 4 million  due to increased departures of 18  these increases were partially offset by lower rents at lax of 8 million  

we expect landing fees and other rentals to be slightly higher in 2013  due to an expected increase in departures 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   15 million  or 8  primarily due to an increase in passengers of 45  and capacity purchase flying of 13 million  related to skywest which began in may 2011 additionally we experienced higher passenger and ramp handling of 2 million  as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where outside vendors are used 

we expect contracted services to be higher in 2013  to handle expected growth in the number of passengers 

selling expenses 

selling expenses decreased  by 7 million  or 4  compared to 2011  as a result of lower fees related to debit card purchases of 4 million  and flat global distribution system gds fees offset by an increase in advertising and promotional activities of 2 million  

we expect selling expense will be higher in 2013  primarily due to increased advertising and promotional activities and revenue related costs such as credit card commissions 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased   17 million  or 7  compared to the prior year this is primarily due to additional depreciation expense for the annualization of b737 aircraft and q400 aircraft delivered in 2011 as well as the deliveries of b737 aircraft in 2012 in addition we incurred depreciation of 6 million since we placed terminal 6 at lax into service in march 2012 these increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation expense for the crj 700 aircraft removed from the fleet in 2011 and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation 

we expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2013  in line with our nine aircraft deliveries and the annualization of seven aircraft deliveries in 2012 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage costs increased   12 million  or 18  from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers of 45  increase in sales of buyonboard products of 20  the higher cost of some of our premium products served on board and increased costs associated with food delivery 

we expect food and beverage costs to be higher in 2013  due to an anticipated increase in sales in line with an expected increase in the number of passengers 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   13 million  or 6  compared to 2011  the increase is primarily driven by higher it and professional service costs of 8 million  associated with our key initiatives and infrastructure improvements and higher personnel nonwage costs such as hotels meals and per diems of 7 million  

we expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2013  due to an expected increase in it spending of approximately 20 million and higher professional service costs 

fleet transition and restructuring related expenses 

fleet transition costs decreased   39 million  as we completed our transition to an allq400 fleet at horizon in 2011 

operating costs per available seat mile 

  

our operating costs per asm casm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

we have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs per asm and our unit costs excluding fuel and other noted items these amounts are included in casm but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our costreduction progress we believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our current expectations for capacity and operating costs per asm are summarized below 



consolidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense decreased   37 million  from 2011  this is due to lower interest expense of 13 million on lower average outstanding debt balances and additional capitalized interest due to higher levels of aircraft purchase deposits and capital expenditures additionally we incurred prepayment penalties of 8 million and an impairment charge of 6 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection in the prior year the decrease was partially offset by lower interest income earned on our marketable securities portfolio 

consolidated income tax expense 

our effective income tax rate for 2012  was 385  compared to 379  for 2011  the difference between the effective tax rates and our statutory tax rate of approximately 375 is due primarily to miscellaneous nondeductible expenses 

  

our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year depending on the magnitude of nondeductible expenses in proportion to pretax results 

  

2011  compared with 2010 

our consolidated net income for 2011  was 245 million  or 333  per diluted share compared to net income of 251 million  or 341  per diluted share in 2010  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods were as follows 

 

 

excluding the marktomarket adjustments and other special charges our adjusted consolidated net income for 2011  was 287 million  or 392  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 263 million  or 357  per share in 2010 



operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased 486 million  or 13  during 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2011   increased  by 15  on an 85 increase in capacity and a 62 increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm compared to 2010  the increase in capacity was driven by the annualization of new routes added in 2010  and new routes in 2011  most of which was hawaii the increase in prasm was driven by a 40 rise in ticket yield and a 19point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the increase in yield was due to an increase in prices to help offset the 36 increase in raw fuel costs 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased  by 42 million  or 6  compared to 2010  on a 128 increase in prasm compared to 2010  despite a 58 decline in capacity the increase in prasm was driven by an 81 increase in ticket yield and a 32point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the decline in capacity and increase in load factors was due to better matching supply with demand in the regional network 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased   3 million  or 2  primarily due to freight fuel surcharge increases of 5 million offset by lower mail revenue on lower volume 

other – net 

othernet revenue increased   41 million  or 9  from 2010  the increase was primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan revenues of 12 million with higher commissions driven by a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles additionally food and beverages sales increased 4 million due to increased volumes 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased   508 million  or 15  compared to 2010  mostly as a result of significantly higher fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2010  are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased  during 2011  by 30 million  or 3  compared to 2010  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased   4  on a 12 increase in ftes as a result of increased flying higher wage rates and a signing bonus to alaskas clerical office and passenger service employees in connection with a new contract ratified in january 2011 productivity as measured by the number of passengers per fte increased 5 compared to 2010  

pension and other retirementrelated benefits decreased   5  primarily due to a reduction in our definedbenefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2010  as compared to the previous year partially offset by a slight increase in definedcontribution expense 

medical benefits decreased   1  from the prior year primarily due to a decline in employee healthcare claims partially offset by an increase in postretirement medical expense 

other benefits and payroll taxes increased   8  from the prior year due to increases in our workers compensation and disability plan as well as increased payroll taxes in line with increased wages 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense decreased  from 92 million  in 2010  to 72 million  in 2011  the decrease was due to the fact that in 2010 our financial and operational results exceeded targets more so than in 2011  

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense increased   397 million  or 44  compared to 2010  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



fuel gallons consumed increased 56 primarily as a result of a 5 increase in block hours and a slight increase in fuel burn per block hour as a result of higher load factors 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased 361 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices the average prices of crude oil and refining margins during 2011  were higher by approximately 19 and 141 respectively as compared to 2010  

gains recognized for hedges that settled during the year was 21 million in 2011  compared to gains of 3 million in 2010  

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance decreased  by 11 million  or 5  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower costs associated with the return of leased aircraft and lower costs due to the phaseout of the crj fleet offset by increased airframe check costs and components 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent decreased   23 million  or 16  compared to the prioryear period primarily due to 14 million less rent related to 11 fewer crj 700 aircraft and 6 million less rent related to five fewer b737 aircraft leased in 2011  compared to 2010  

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased   5 million  or 2  primarily due to a 4 million increase in facilities rents across our network and a 2 million increase in our landing fee expenses mainline landing fee expenses increased due to a 9 increase in departures partially offset by a 10 decrease in our regional departures 

contracted services 

contracted services increased   22 million  or 14  primarily due to an increase in capacity purchased flying of 13 million compared to the prior year as the new agreement with skywest began in may 2011 additionally we experienced higher passenger handling of 3 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where vendors are used and an increase in contract labor of 2 million 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased  by 21 million  or 14  compared to 2010  as a result of higher travel agent and ticket distribution costs of 11 million and credit card commissions of 6 million due to increased revenues of 13 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 17 million  or 7  compared to the prior year this is primarily due to additional depreciation expense of 18 million for b737 aircraft 7 million increase in q400 aircraft depreciation offset by a decrease of 4 million in crj 700 aircraft and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage costs increased   10 million  or 17  from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers increased sales of buy on board products a higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board and increased costs associated with food delivery 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased   34 million  or 17  compared to 2010  the increase is primarily driven by higher personnel nonwage costs such as hotels meals and per diems of 8 million and higher professional service costs of 7 million as well as higher costs for communications property taxes passenger remunerations and deicing 

fleet transition and restructuring related expenses 

fleet transition costs increased   26 million  as we finalized our transition to an allq400 fleet the increase was directly due to net charges of 28 million related to the removal of the crj700 aircraft and related inventory and a loss on the final disposition of q200 aircraft of 11 million in 2011  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense was 55 million  in 2011  compared to 65 million  in 2010  the 10 million decrease is due to lower interest expense due to payments on maturing debt and prepayments of debt in 2011 higher capitalized interest due to higher levels of capital expenditures offset by lower investment returns in our marketable securities portfolio and an impairment charge of 6 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection and otherthantemporaryimpairments on mortgagebacked securities 

consolidated income tax expense 

our effective income tax rate for 2011  was 379  compared to 381  for 2010  the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our statutory tax rate of approximately 378 is due primarily to miscellaneous nondeductible expenses such as per diems 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

 

 

in 2012  we took free and clear delivery of four b737900er three b737800 aircraft and two q400 aircraft we paid off outstanding debt associated with seven  aircraft totaling 103 million  and made scheduled debt payments totaling 172 million  in addition we continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing 60 million  of our common stock in 2012  which included stock repurchases under a new 250 million  program authorized by the board in september 2012  finally we made voluntary contributions to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 110 million  in 2012  although there were no funding requirements we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

the overall strength of our balance sheet was one of the contributing factors for standard  poors recent decision to change our outlook from stable to positive in 2012 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our overall investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives approved and prohibited investments and duration and credit quality guidelines our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy as of december 31 2012  we had a 12 million  unrealized gain on our 13 billion  cash and marketable securities balance 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



  

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 753 million  in 2012 compared to 696 million  in the prior year the 57 million   increase was primarily driven by 339 million  in increased revenue offset by higher fuel of 161 million  and higher nonfuel operating costs to support increased revenues and capacity also cash received from the sale of miles under our mileage plan program increased approximately 30 million due a 5 increase in miles sold with a 4 increase in rate in addition we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan of 110 million versus 133 million  in the prior year and we paid cash taxes of 78 million in the current year compared to 8 million  in 2011 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 645 million  during 2012  compared to 403 million  in 2011  our capital expenditures were 518 million  or 131 million  higher than in 2011  this is due to the delivery of four b737900er aircraft three b737800 aircraft and two q400 aircraft compared to three b737800 aircraft in the prior year as well as purchase deposits for the nine b737900er aircraft to be delivered next year and initial deposits related to our new boeing agreements 

in 2012 we entered into a new agreement and modified existing agreements with boeing to acquire 50 737 aircraft including 37 of boeings new 737 max aircraft this order positions alaska to replace aging aircraft over the next decade including the phase out of nearly all of its 737400 aircraft by the end of 2017 and continue to operate one of the most modern environmentally friendly comfortable and fuelefficient fleets in the united states 

we now have firm commitments for 71  b737 aircraft through 2022 with options to acquire up to 69  additional 737 nextgen ng aircraft and max aircraft in 2015  through 2024  the options for both ng and max aircraft will give alaska the flexibility but not the obligation to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met the new agreements will result in increased capital spending over the next ten years depending on how many of our options are exercised 

the table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised these options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be meet 



 

in addition our capital expenditures related to terminal 6 at los angeles international airports lax were lower by 53 million as we placed the assets constructed for others into service in march for financial reporting purposes this asset will remain on our balance sheet as we did not qualify for sale accounting due to our continuing involvement with the facility over the last two years we have been reimbursed 182 million which is classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

cash used by financing activities 

  

cash used by financing activities was 88 million  during 2012  compared to 281 million  in the prior year during the current year we had scheduled debt payments of 172 million  debt prepayments of 103 million  and stock repurchases of 60 million  partially offset by proceeds of 49 million  related to three b737700 saleleasebacks 

in addition we received reimbursement from los angeles world airport lawa for our construction of terminal 6 at lax of 178 million  

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

the company has two 100 million credit facilities both facilities have variable interest rates based on libor plus a specified margin borrowings on one of the 100 million  facilities which expires in august 2015  are secured by aircraft borrowings on the other 100 million  facility are secured by certain accounts receivable spare engines spare parts and ground service equipment we modified the first facility in 2012 by extending the term from march 2013  to august 2015  and the second facility in 2011 by extending the term from march 2014  to march 2016  and reduced the commitment fee for both facilities the company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

overall we have firm orders to purchase 71  aircraft we have options to acquire 69  additional b737 aircraft and options to acquire 10  q400 aircraft 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments by year 



we expect to pay for the firm future aircraft deliveries in 2013  with cash on hand for future firm orders and if we exercise our options for additional deliveries we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash longterm debt or lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

we use both call options for crude oil futures and swap agreements for jet fuel refining margins to hedge against price volatility of future jet fuel consumption we have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50  of our first  quarter 2013  estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 89 cents  per gallon our crude oil positions are as follows 



contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2012  



 

pension obligations 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans which we estimate to be 35 million  to 50 million  per year although there are no minimum required contributions the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 335 million  at december 31 2012  compared to 306 million  at december 31 2011  this results in an 82  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 81  funded as of december 31 2011  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million under another such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 500 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

deferred income taxes 

for federal income tax purposes the majority of our assets are fully depreciated over a sevenyear life using an accelerated depreciation method for financial reporting purposes the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 20 years to an estimated salvage value using the straightline basis this difference has created a significant deferred tax liability at some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid 

while it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future we cannot estimate the timing of longterm cash flows with reasonable accuracy taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items including the amount of book income generated which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices level of pension funding which is generally not known until late each year whether bonus depreciation provisions are available as well as other legislative changes that are out of our control 

in 2012  we made tax payments of 78 million  in 2013  if we have similar financial performance our cash taxes may be significantly more due to utilization of federal net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits in 2012  however this is highly dependent on actual taxable income and other factors that are difficult to estimate at this time 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

for miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future for miles sold to third parties a portion of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue in the period that miles are sold this represents services provided by the company to its business partners and relates primarily to the use of the companys logo and trademarks along with access to the companys mileage plan members commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  was 143 million  138 million  and 124 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2012  we had approximately 131 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 730 million  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that 

require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

   

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the selling price of award travel by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as our estimates of selling price change the amount we defer changes resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period a 1 increase in the estimated selling price of travel and related deferral rate would decrease commission revenue by approximately 3 million this amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place 

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimates of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage consider historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors a hypothetical 1 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately an 8 million effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical travel redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

pension plans 

  

accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 57 million  42 million  and 50 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we expect the 2013  expense to be approximately 50 million  

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2012  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 725  which is consistent with the expected rate at december 31 2011  this rate was developed using historical data the current value of the underlying assets as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2012  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixedincome securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 050  from 725  to 675  would increase our estimated 2013  pension expense by approximately 8 million  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 395  and 465  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the discount rate at december 31 2012  was determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans decreasing the discount rate by 05  from 395  to 345  would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2012  by approximately 142 million  and increase estimated 2013  pension expense by approximately 11 million  

  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans will be frozen january 1 2014 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 36 billion  of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with the call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts the swap contracts do not require an upfront premium but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2012  would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio by approximately 112 million  and 35 million  respectively 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 64  million at december 31 2012  compared to a portfolio value of 107  million at december 31 2011  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2012  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see derivative instruments note in our consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rates 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2012  would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than 1 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements our variablerate debt is approximately 18  of our total longterm debt at december 31 2012  compared to 23  at december 31 2011  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2012  interest income would increase by approximately 12 million

tableend

  

alaska air group inc air group the company our we or us is a delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and has two principal subsidiaries alaska airlines inc alaska and horizon air industries inc horizon which provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the united states canada and mexico during 2011 we provided air service to more than 24 million passengers and flew to more than 100 destinations 

the domestic airline industry is fiercely competitive to set ourselves apart we have focused on outstanding operational performance and customer service as evidenced by being ranked “highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers” by jd power and associates for four consecutive years we believe we differentiate ourselves in a number of ways 

first we offer an awardwinning frequent flyer program the alaska airlines mileage plan tm  members can earn and redeem miles on alaska horizon and a network of 15 airline partners around the globe including delta air lines and american airlines in the us our mileage plan has earned recognition as the frequent flyer program of the year five times in the freddie awards in addition our mileage plan visa card has been named “best loyalty credit card in the americas” for two years running 

second we are recognized as having industryleading ontime performance and other key operational metrics we are the only airline in the country with a baggage service guarantee and recently launched new mobile applications for android and iphone smart phones that provide customers with new functionality aimed at making their travel experience more convenient and hasslefree improving the travel experience particularly in the airport environment is an area we will continue to focus on in 2012 

third we aim to provide a high quality onboard experience to our passengers for example we equipped our fleet of 737 aircraft with onboard wifi capability with 98 percent of the fleet equipped alaska is an industry leader in this area the company also continues to focus on serving highquality food and beverage products on board using local products from the pacific northwest and hawaii our northern bites mealsforpurchase program had record sales in 2011 and on february 1 2012 we introduced starbucks coffee on on alaska flights starbucks has been featured on horizon flights for many years additionally alaska recently took delivery of its first new 737 featuring the boeing dreamlinerinspired sky interior all future deliveries will include this new interior 

fourth we want to be known for our environmental leadership in the fall of 2011 our airlines were the first us carriers to operate multiple scheduled biofuel flights we flew over 75 commercial flights between seattle  washington dc and seattle  portland using a 20 percent aviation biofuel blend refined from used cooking oil these routes were selected to demonstrate the use of biofuel on a transcontinental route on a boeing 737 and a shorthaul operation using the bombardier q400 our inflight recycling programs divert an estimated 800 tons of mixed recyclables from local landfills each year in 2011 horizon flight attendants collected and diverted 90 percent of all recyclable materials with alaska flight crews setting a goal to divert 70 percent of all recyclable materials in 2012 further we are spearheading a greener skies initiative to implement gps technology which will allow airlines to use more efficient and environmentallyfriendly flight paths resulting in  improved flight procedures and reduced emissions 

and finally we are striving to establish more direct relationships with our customers by engaging them whenever possible at alaskaaircom our completely redesigned website introduced in 2011 is now among the industrys fastest and is better equipped to offer a full range of travel products and services to our customers our focus is to drive more visitors to the site through enhanced online search efforts email marketing an expanded social media presence and other digital marketing efforts as a result alaskaaircoms share of total bookings is now over 50 percent 

although alaska and horizon both operate as airlines their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 horizon was acquired by air group in 1986 alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets mainline operations and contracts with horizon skywest airlines inc skywest and peninsula airways inc penair for regional capacity under which alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement the horizon cpa the horizon cpa reflects what the company believes are current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying amounts paid by alaska to horizon are available to pay for various horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership costs 

  

effective january 1 2011 horizons business model changed such that 100 of its capacity is sold to alaska under the horizon cpa as is typical for similar arrangements certain costs such as landing fees selling and distribution costs and fuel costs directly related to regional flights operated by horizon are now recorded by alaska because of this change horizons revenues and expenses and alaskas regional revenues and expenses have changed significantly on a yearoveryear basis 



  

mainline 

  

we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and thirteen cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2011  we carried nearly 18 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations and we carry more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the number of passengers carried in 2011  alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2011  revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlelas vegas at december 31 2011  alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 117 boeing 737 jet aircraft compared to 114 aircraft as of december 31 2010  

the percentage of mainline passenger traffic by market is presented below 



regional 

  

in 2011  our regional operations carried nearly 7 million revenue passengers primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california horizon is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and represented 87 98 and 98 of air groups regional revenue passengers during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

based on 2011  passenger enplanements on regional aircraft the leading airports are seattle portland spokane and boise based on revenues in 2011  the leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and seattlevancouver british columbia canada at december 31 2011  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 48 bombardier q400 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under alaskas designator code in airline reservation systems and in most other customerfacing locations 

  

  

the percentage of regional passenger traffic by market is presented below 



  

air group capacity 

we attempt to deploy aircraft into the network in a way that best optimizes our revenues and profitability reduces our seasonality and takes advantage of demand in areas where other carriers have either exited or dont have the ability to serve 

the percentage of our capacity by market is as follows 



industry conditions competition and alliances 

  

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by low profit margins subject to various uncertainties this includes general economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability intense competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulation and potential aircraft incidents airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

year in review — 2011   

2011  was characterized by continued industry capacity discipline with an increase in passenger traffic this allowed for higher load factors and yields leading others in the industry to report higher revenue and in some cases stronger adjusted earnings compared to 2010 jet fuel prices increased significantly in 2011 and that continues to be an area of concern in 2012  

during 2011  our key initiative was to optimize revenue we continued to redeploy capacity to better match demand resulting in record passenger load factors we also worked to lower nonfuel unit costs to better compete with carriers that have lower cost structures along with our continued focus on customer service and our strong operational performance we reported record adjusted financial results that again were among the best in the industry 

  



  

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel prices have been extremely volatile over the past few years and are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil as well as the west coast refining margin which represent the price of refining crude oil into jet fuel and can vary by region in the us 

  

the price of crude oil spiked in 2008 with a high of nearly 150 per barrel in july 2008 and dropped significantly to an average of 62 per barrel in 2009 we saw upward pressure on fuel prices again with an average crude oil price of just over 80 per barrel in 2010 and 95 per barrel in 2011 for us a 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately 9 million of additional fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 4 million per year 

while west coast refining margins are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel than crude oil they also contributed to the overall price volatility in recent years refining margin prices reached a high of nearly 45 per barrel in may 2008 before they dropped to an average price of 24 per barrel in 2009 refining margins prices dropped further in 2010 to average 14 a barrel but then jumped upwards in 2011 and averaged 33 a barrel for the year generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting our airlines at a slight competitive disadvantage 

we refer to the price we pay for fuel at the airport including applicable taxes as our “raw” fuel price historically fuel costs have generally represented 10 to 15 of an airline’s operating costs but due to volatility in prices over the past few years fuel costs have been in the range of 30 to 50 of total operating costs both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results 

our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 36  in 2011  27 in 2010  and declined 43 in 2009  

  

we use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with the call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts the swap contracts do not require an upfront premium but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period 



we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet horizon completed its transition to an allq400 turboprop fleet in 2011 because of these changes alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 659 asmsg in 2006 to 766 asmsg in 2011  similarly horizon’s fuel burn has improved from 517 asmsg in 2006 to 593 asmsg in 2011  

these reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

competition 

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we carry approximately 4 of all us domestic passenger traffic we compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes including both major legacy carriers and lowcost carriers 

due to its shorthaul markets our regional operations also competes with ground transportation in many markets including train bus and automobile transportation both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

alliances with other airlines 

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as codesharing on certain flights as shown in the table below alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

  

our marketing alliances with other airlines are as follows 



 

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

 

our sales by channel are as follows 



  

seasonality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic it typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have taken steps over the past few years to reduce the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations in hawaii and mexico 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

 

• pricing initiatives by us and our competitors 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition to those factors listed above seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and reaccommodation of displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

employees 

  

labor costs have historically made up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition new entrants into the us airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines 

we had 12806 9640 at alaska and 3166 at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2011  compared to 12039 9013 at alaska and 3202 at horizon at december 31 2010  wages salaries and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 41 and 43 of our total nonfuel operating expenses and 27 and 31 of our total expenses in 2011  and 2010  respectively 

  

at december 31 2011  labor unions represented 83 of alaska’s and 47 of horizon’s employees our relations with our us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

  

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2011  were as follows 



horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2011  were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated 

the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 13 

  

regulations covering subjects such as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response as of january 26 2012 carriers must adhere to dot’s fullfare advertising rule which requires quoted fares to include all applicable government taxes and fees 

 

 

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

airline fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve 

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

it is expected that there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions alaska and horizon have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets thereby greatly reducing our total emissions 

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

  

customer service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals and regulatory requirements including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds as a testament to our service alaska has won the jd power and associates award for highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the past four years 

insurance 

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties since the september 11 2001 attacks this insurance program excludes coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils so like other airlines the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the us government 

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance

 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

we have adopted an enterprise wide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives within management ranks as well as align these risks with appropriate board level oversight these enterprise level identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or cpa carriers 

could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public we could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and cpa carriers however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have 

  

issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines and consumer protections similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future in recent years alaska and horizon have subcontracted their heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure 

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

  

   

 16 

  

  

   

 

 

due to our geographic area of operations we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

strategy 

the airline industry is highly competitive if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 

we face significant competition with respect to routes services and fares some of our competitors have lower costs than we do and provide service to destinations served by us we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns and therefore our financial results may suffer 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles hawaii and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2011  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 63 of our total passengers 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the recent us and global economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for air travel while some economic indicators are showing signs of growth unemployment remains high in some of our key markets given that the strength of the us and global economies have an impact on the demand for air travel a longterm economic slump could result in a need to adjust our capacity plans which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan 

  

program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

in november 2011 amr corporation the parent of american airlines filed for bankruptcy protection we do not believe the bankruptcy will impact our marketing agreement with american airlines 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure or disruption of these systems or their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website reservation system and checkin systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to do business with another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruptions untimely recovery or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at alaskaaircom depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including credit card information a compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our customers’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial position and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business partners is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes 

financial condition and financial markets 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 34 and 27 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively significant increases in average fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations 

future increases in the price of jet fuel will harm our financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 

our definedbenefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk if market returns are poor in the future any future obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity poor market returns also lead to higher pension expense in our consolidated statements of operations the calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “critical accounting estimates” and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints 

  

although we have reduced our longterm debt balance significantly over the past three years we have and may continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

  

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

   

 

 

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements we cannot be certain that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 

see “liquidity and capital resources” for more detailed information about our obligations and commitments 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

aviation insurers could increase their premiums in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through september 30 2013 although the government may again extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

brand and reputation 

we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives which may negatively impact our brand and reputation 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand perception to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers these efforts include significant improvements to our airport space at los angeles international airport 

lax and efforts to increase our direct customer relationships through improvements to our online purchasing portal alaskaaircom social media and customer loyalty programs club 49 

if these efforts are unsuccessful or they negatively affect our reputation with our existing customer base we may experience an adverse impact on our business and financial results furthermore with the ongoing horizon brand phaseout there is a potential that we may lose some brand recognition from our customers in areas that horizon has historically served 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

a significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of 

key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 27 and 31 of our total operating expenses in 2011  and 2010  respectively each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them 

as of december 31 2011  labor unions represented approximately 83 of alaska’s and 47 of horizon’s employees although we have been successful in maturing communications negotiating approaches and other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in the companys longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction affecting employee focus in our business and diverting management’s attention from other projects and issues 

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in the companys strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed

year in review 

our 2011  consolidated pretax income was 3937 million  compared to 4059 million  in 2010  the 122 million  decline was primarily due to the 3968 million  increase in aircraft fuel expense and 1114 million  increase in other operating expenses partially offset by the 4855 million  improvement in revenues the increase in fuel cost was driven by the 361  increase in raw cost per gallon on a 56  increase in consumption our improvement in revenues was primarily due to a 96  increase in traffic and a 33  increase in yield 

see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

accomplishments and highlights 

  

accomplishments and highlights from 2011  include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

   

 

horizon fleet transition 

  

to strengthen the regional operations we implemented several changes in 2011 including unifying our external brand to the alaska airlines brand horizon became a 100 cpa carrier horizon transitioned to an allq400 fleet horizon subleased crj700 aircraft and removed all residual inventory horizon outsourced certain activities to third parties and a limited number of long stagelength routes were transitioned to skywest 

new markets 

  

in 2011  we added several nonstop routes to our overall network as follows 



we will also add new cities and nonstop routes in 2012 as follows 



the changes above when combined with the significant number of network changes over the last few years have diversified our network and made us less dependent on our historical markets in the state of alaska and up and down the west coast we believe our smaller size makes us more nimble than some of our larger competitors gives us a closer connection with our customers and allows us to identify and respond to market opportunities quickly 

  

stock repurchase 

in 2011 we repurchased 1309300  shares of our common stock for 795 million  under the 50 million repurchase plans authorized by the our board of directors in june 2010 and june 2011 since 2007 we have repurchased 84 million  shares of common stock under such programs for 262 million  for an average price of approximately 31  per share 

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run safe compliant and reliable operations at our airlines in addition to our primary objective our key initiative in 2012  is to focus on the customer travel experience our specific focus will be on providing information and mobile capabilities to our customers as well as to speed them through the airport on the day of travel 

our biggest concern for 2012  is the rising cost of fuel however with our fuelefficient aircraft and our fuel hedge portfolio we believe we are better prepared to handle those rising costs than others in the industry 

our advance bookings suggest our load factors will be up 25 pts in february and 25 pts in march compared to the same periods in 2011  on an expected 35 increase in capacity for the first quarter of 2012 

subsequent events 

on february 15 2012 the board of directors declared a twoforone split of the companys common stock to be accomplished by means of a stock distribution the additional shares will be distributed on march 16 2012 to the shareholders of record on march 2 2012 the stock split will increase the companys outstanding shares from approximately 355 million  shares to about 710 million  shares our historical outstanding shares will be recast upon the distribution 

additionally the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to purchase up to 50 million of its common stock with available cash on hand 

furthermore the board of directors authorized horizon to purchase two q400 aircraft in april and june 2012 and sell two q400 aircraft in the fall of 2012 the expected capital expenditures and aircraft purchase commitments reflect this action 

results   of operations 

  

2011  compared with 2010   

our consolidated net income for 2011  was 2445 million  or 666  per diluted share compared to net income of 2511 million  or 683  per diluted share in 2010  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

adjusted nongaap results and   pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because 

 

 

 

 

  

 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

excluding the marktomarket adjustments and other special charges our adjusted consolidated net income for 2011  was 2874 million  or 783  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 2626 million  or 714  per share in 2010  



  

operating statistics summary unaudited 

alaska air group inc 

below are operating statistics we use to measure operating performance we often refer to unit revenues and adjusted unit costs which is a nongaap measure refer to page 34 on why this measure may be meaningful 



 

  

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased 4855 million  or 127  during 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2011  improved by 149  on an 85  increase in capacity and a 59  increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm compared to 2010  the increase in capacity is driven by the annualization of new routes added in 2010  and new routes in 2011  most of which was hawaii the increase in prasm was driven by a 35  rise in ticket yield and a 19 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the increase in yield is due to raising prices to help offset the 36 increase in raw fuel costs 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased by 493 million  or 68  compared to 2010  on a 134  increase in prasm compared to 2010  despite a 58  decline in capacity the increase in prasm was driven by an 88  increase in ticket yield and a 32 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year the decline in capacity and increase in load factors is due to better matching supply with demand in the regional network 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased 25 million  or 24  primarily due to freight fuel surcharge increases of 54 million offset by lower mail revenue on lower volume 

other – net 

other—net revenue increased 209 million  or 88  from 2010  the increase is primarily due to an increase in our mileage plan revenues of 116 million with higher commissions driven by a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles additionally food and beverages sales increased 43 million due to increased volumes 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased 5082 million  or 151  compared to 2010  mostly as a result of significantly higher fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2010  are more fully described below 

  

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits increased during 2011  by 296 million  or 31  compared to 2010  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages increased 43 on a 12 increase in ftes as a result of increased flying higher wage rates and a signing bonus to alaskas clerical office and passenger service employees in connection with a new contract ratified in january 2011 productivity as measured by the number of passengers per fte increased 50  compared to 2010 

the 55 decline in pension and other retirementrelated benefits is primarily due to a reduction in our definedbenefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2010 as compared to the previous year partially offset by a slight increase in definedcontribution expense 

medical benefits decreased 08 from the prior year primarily due to a decline in employee healthcare claims partially offset by an increase in postretirement medical expense 

other benefits and payroll taxes increased 79 from the prior year due to increases in our workers compensation and disability plan as well as increased payroll taxes in line with increased wages 

we expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher ftes to support increases in volume and higher pension expense of approximately 15 million 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense decreased from 920 million  in 2010  to 719 million  in 2011  the decrease is due to the fact that in 2010 our financial and operational results exceeded targets more so than in 2011  

if we meet targets established under our performance based pay and operational performance rewards programs variable incentive pay will be approximately 55 million to 60 million per year if we exceed the targets variable incentive pay will be higher if we do not achieve targets it will be lower 

see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense  as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense  is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense  approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 3968 million  or 440  compared to 2010  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

fuel gallons consumed increased 56  primarily as a result of a 5 increase in block hours and a slight increase in fuel burn per block hour as a result of higher load factors 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased 361  as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices west coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the higher price of crude oil as well as increased refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel the average prices of crude oil and refining margins during 2011 were higher by approximately 19 and 141 respectively as compared to 2010 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from or pay to hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

our economic fuel expense  is calculated as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

as noted above the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the year was 214 million  in 2011  compared to a benefit of 33 million  in 2010  these amounts represent the cash received net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 18 higher in the first  quarter of 2012  due to the rising cost of jet fuel as both oil prices and refining margins are volatile we are unable to forecast the fullyear cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance declined by 109 million  or 50  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower costs associated with the return of leased aircraft and lower costs due to the phaseout of the crj fleet offset by increased airframe check costs and components we expect aircraft maintenance to be slightly higher in 2012 in line with additional block hours and the timing of scheduled maintenance events 

  

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent declined 226 million  or 163  compared to the prioryear period primarily due to 137 million less rent related to 11 fewer crj 700 aircraft and 55 million less rent related to 5 fewer b737 aircraft leased in 2011  compared to 2010  we currently do not expect any leased aircraft to be returned in 2012 nor do we expect to lease any new aircraft 

landing fees and other rentals 

landing fees and other rentals increased 54 million  or 23  primarily due to a 36 million increase in facilities rents across our network and a 18 million increase in our landing fee expenses mainline landing fee expenses increased due to a 9 increase in departures partially offset by decreases in our regional departures of 10 we expect landing fees and other rentals to be higher in 2012 due to increased rates and a slight increase in departures 

contracted services 

contracted services increased 221 million  or 136  primarily due to an increase in capacity purchased flying of 132 million compared to the prior year as the new agreement with skywest began in may 2011 additionally we experienced higher passenger handling of 28 million as a result of an increase in the number of flights to airports where vendors are used and an increase in contract labor of 21 million 

we expect contracted services to be higher in 2012 due to the full year impact of our capacity agreement with skywest and the use of contracted labor in hawaii 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased by 215 million  or 140  compared to 2010  as a result of higher travel agent and ticket distribution costs of 108 million and credit card commissions of 63 million due to increased revenues of 127  

we expect selling expense will be higher in 2012 primarily due to higher revenuerelated expenses 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 164 million  or 71  compared to the prior year this is primarily due to additional depreciation expense of 180 million for the b737 mainline aircraft 69 million increase in q400 aircraft depreciation offset by a decrease of 40 million in crj 700 aircraft and other assets that became fully depreciated or were removed from operation 

we expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2012 in line with our six new aircraft deliveries and the annualization of 2011 deliveries 

food and beverage service 

food and beverage costs increased 97 million  or 169  from the prior year due to an increased number of passengers increase in sales of buy on board products the higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board and increased costs associated with food delivery we expect food and beverage costs to be higher in 2012 due to increased passenger and departure volume 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses increased 346 million  or 172  compared to 2010  the increase is primarily driven by higher personnel nonwage costs such as hotels meals and per diems of 81 million and higher professional service costs of 74 million as well as higher costs for communications property taxes passenger remunerations and deicingwe expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2012 due to higher  property taxes professional services it and training costs 

fleet transition and restructuring related expenses 

fleet transition costs increased 257 million  as we finalized our transition to an all q400 fleet the increase was directly due to net charges of 283 million  related to the removal of the crj700 aircraft and related inventory and a loss on the final disposition of q200 aircraft of 106 million  in 2011 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

we have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs per asm and our unit costs excluding fuel and other noted items these amounts are included in casm but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our costreduction progress we believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons

our current expectations for capacity and operating costs per asm are summarized below 



consolidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense was 552 million  in 2011  compared to 657 million  in 2010  the 105 million  decrease is due to lower interest expense due to payments on maturing debt and prepayments of debt in the current year higher capitalized interest due to higher levels of capital expenditures offset by lower investment returns in our marketable securities portfolio and an impairment charge of 62 million on an owned aircraft that was leased to another carrier that filed for bankruptcy protection and otherthantemporaryimpairments on mortgagebacked securities 

consolidated income tax expense 

our effective income tax rate for 2011  was 379  compared to 381  for 2010  the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 378 is due primarily to miscellaneous nondeductible expenses such as per diems 

our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year depending on the magnitude of nondeductible expenses in proportion to pretax results 

2010  compared with 2009   

our consolidated net income for 2010  was 2511 million  or 683  per diluted share compared to net income of 1216 million  or 336  per diluted share in 2009  significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

 

excluding the marktomarket adjustments fleet transition and restructuring costs our adjusted consolidated net income for 2010  was 2626 million  or 714  per diluted share compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of 887 million  or 245  per share in 2009  



  

operating revenues 

total operating revenues increased 4325 million  or 127  during 2010  compared to the same period in 2009  the changes are summarized in the following table 



passenger revenue – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue for 2010  improved by 133  on a 56  increase in capacity and a 73  increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm compared to 2009  the increase in prasm was driven by a 23  rise in ticket yield and a 40 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year 

passenger revenue – regional 

regional passenger revenue increased by 566 million  or 85  compared to 2009  on a 102  increase in prasm compared to 2009  despite relatively flat capacity the increase in prasm was driven by a 66  increase in ticket yield and a 24 point increase in load factor compared to the prior year 

freight and mail 

freight and mail revenue increased 103 million  or 107  primarily as a result of higher volumes and yield and higher security and freight fuel surcharges 

other – net 

other—net revenue increased 410 million  or 209  from 2009  the increase is primarily due to mileage plan revenues rising by 318 million stemming from a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses increased 2283 million  or 73  compared to 2009  mostly as a result of significantly higher fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



significant operating expense variances from 2009  are more fully described below 

  

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits decreased during 2010  by 272 million  or 28  compared to 2009  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



wages were relatively flat on a reduction in fte compared to 2009  wages have not declined in step with the fte reduction because of the higher wage rates for the pilot group in connection with their new contract effective april 1 2009 and higher average wages for certain other employees after 2009  and early 2010  furloughs which are generally senioritybased however productivity as measured by the number of passengers per fte increased 92  compared to 2009  

the 248  decline in pension and other retirementrelated benefits is primarily due to a significant reduction in our definedbenefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2009  as compared to the previous year and the closing of the definedbenefit plans to the new pilot entrants with their new contract in 2009  

medical benefits increased 49  from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in employee healthcare costs partially offset by a decrease in postretirement medical expense for the pilot group 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased from 760 million  in 2009  to 920 million  in 2010  the increase is primarily due to the fact that in 2010 our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our board more so than in 2009  in 2010  additional workgroups were included to the pbp plan resulting in higher earnings than the profit sharing plan in which they previously participated 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense increased 2428 million  or 369  compared to 2009  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

fuel gallons consumed increased 34 primarily as a result of a 11 increase in block hours and an increase in fuel burn due to higher load factors 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased 266  as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs and refining margins 

  

our economic fuel expense  is calculated as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

as noted above the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 33 million  in 2010  compared to a loss of 607 million  in 2009  these amounts represent the cash received net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance declined by 66 million  or 30  compared to the prior year period mainline maintenance decreased due to less expensive events lower component costs and decreased costs associated with aircraft returns offset by increased engine events in the regional business 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent declined 148 million  or 96  compared to 2009  as a result of the return of three b737400 and two b737700 leased aircraft as well as the removal of five crj700 leased aircraft in 2010  

landing fees and other rents 

landing fees and other rents increased 96 million  or 43  compared to 2009  the increase is attributable to higher rates in many airports across our network and more departures 

contracted services 

contracted services increased 124 million  or 82  compared to the prior year as a result of increased use of vendors across our network primarily related to our hawaii network growth 

selling expenses 

selling expenses increased by 220 million  or 167  compared to 2009  as a result of higher credit card and travel agent commissions and ticket distribution costs resulting from the increase in passenger revenue 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 113 million  or 52  compared to the prior year this is primarily due to four b737800 aircraft deliveries in 2010  and a full period of depreciation for the ten b737800 aircraft delivered in 2009  

food and beverage service 

food and beverage costs increased 74 million  or 148  from 2009  due to an increased number of passengers the higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board and increased costs associated with food delivery 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses declined 132 million  or 62  compared to the prior year the decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and lower personnel nonwage costs partially offset by higher property taxes 

  

fleet transition and restructuring related expenses 

we recorded 103 million  in 2010 related to the removal of five crj700 aircraft from our operations under sublease or lease assignment to thirdparty carriers we also recorded 29 million  of restructuring charges associated with the voluntary separation of a number of employees resulting from the decision to outsource the remaining aircraft heavy maintenance function at horizon to a third party 

in 2009  fleet transition costs associated with the removal of q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were 88 million  as the final q200 aircraft were removed from operation 

during 2009  in connection with a new fouryear contract alaskas pilots received a onetime aggregate bonus of 203 million we also recorded transition expense associated with establishing the new sickleave payout program which totaled 155 million bringing the total pilot contract transition cost to 358 million

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense was 657 million  in 2010  compared to 645 million  in 2009  interest expense increased 40 million  primarily due to the writeoff of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties on debt prepaid in 2010 partially offset by lower average interest rates on our variablerate debt and a lower average debt balance other—net nonoperating income expense improved by 74 million  compared to 2009  primarily due to larger realized gains on the sale of marketable securities 

consolidated income tax expense 

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income for 2010  was 381  compared to 401  for 2009  the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 379 is due to nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards

in 2011  we paid off outstanding debt associated with seven  aircraft and a portion of the outstanding debt for four additional aircraft totaling 1647 million  in addition we repurchased 795 million  of our common stock in 2011  and completed our existing 50 million board authorization in january 2012 finally we made a voluntary contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans of 1333 million  in 2011  although there were no funding requirements we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in securities that meet our overall investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and is continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy as of december 31 2011  we had a 122 million  unrealized gain on our 11 billion  cash and marketable securities balance 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



  

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2011  net cash provided by operating activities was 6960 million  compared to 5527 million  during 2010  the 1433 million  million increase was primarily driven by increased revenues during 2011 higher advanced ticket sales reduced cash spend on aircraft rent and increases in miles sold to our mileage plan partners partially offset by higher fuel and nonfuel operating expenses 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations and expect to use a portion to invest in capital expenditures 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures and to a lesser extent purchases and sales of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 4033 million  during 2011  compared to 2952 million  in 2010  our capital expenditures were 3874 million  or 2021 million  higher than in 2010  due to eight q400 aircraft purchases and advance deposits related to our delivery schedule for the next two years 

in addition we spent 1079 million related to the renovation of terminal 6 at lax as the project progresses towards completion in the spring of 2012 for financial reporting purposes we are considered the owner of the assets under construction when we transfer the project to los angeles world airports lawa this asset will remain on our balance sheet 

  

as we will not qualify for sale accounting due to our continuing involvement with the facility as of december 31 2011 we estimate that the total cost of the project will be approximately 2350 million  of which 210 million  will be reimbursed by lawa amounts that have currently been reimbursed and future reimbursements will be included in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity 

  

we currently expect capital expenditures for 2012  to be as follows in millions 



a includes two additional aircraft authorized subsequent to december 31 2011 

the expected increase in capital expenditures from 2011  is due to payments associated with the deliveries of three b737800 aircraft th ree b737900er and advance deposits related to our aircraft delivery schedule discussed later under aircraft purchase commitments we preliminarily expect 2013  capital expenditures to be approximately 360 million  

cash used by financing activities 

  

net cash used by financing activities was 2800 million  during 2011  and 3322 million  during 2010  during the current year we had scheduled debt payments of 1688 million  debt prepayments of 1647 million  and stock repurchases of 795 million  offset by the issuance of 1065 million  debt that was used to payoff existing debt with higher interest rates 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

the company has two 100 million credit facilities both facilities have variable interest rates based on libor plus a specified margin borrowings on one of the 100 million  facilities which expires in march 2013  are secured by aircraft borrowings on the other 100 million  facility are secured by certain accounts receivable spare engines spare parts and ground service equipment during 2011 we modified the second facility by extending the term from march 2014  to march 2016  and reduced the commitment fee the company has no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

overall we had firm orders to purchase 27  aircraft as set forth below we have options to acquire 42  additional b737s and options to acquire 10  q400s 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments by year 



 

we expect to pay for the firm future aircraft deliveries with cash on hand if we exercise our options for additional deliveries we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash longterm debt or operating lease arrangements 

future fuel hedge positions 

we use both call options for crude oil futures and swap agreements for jet fuel refining margins to hedge against price volatility 

  

of future jet fuel consumption we have refining margin swaps in place for approximately 50  of our first  quarter 2012  estimated jet fuel purchases at an average price of 83  cents per gallon and 11 of our second  quarter 2012  estimated purchases at an average price of 76 cents per gallon our crude oil positions are as follows 



contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2011  



 

pension obligations 

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans which estimate to be 35 million to 50 million per year although there is no minimum required contribution in 2012  in both 2011 and 2010  we made yearend voluntary supplemental pension contributions of 100 million bringing the funding total in both years to approximately 300 million the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 3063 million  at december 31 2011  compared to 2003 million  at december 31 2010  this results in an 81  funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 85  funded as of december 31 2010  the decrease in funded status despite voluntary contributions is directly due to a lower discount rate resulting in an actuarial loss of 2063 million  thus increasing the projected benefit obligation and lower projected asset returns 

  

  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement under another such agreement we would be obligated to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below 350 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

return on invested capital 

  

we strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business our target return on invested capital roic is 10 we surpassed this goal in both 2011 and 2010 but have not historically reached this threshold on average over our business cycle 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

for miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense for the obligation to provide travel in the future for miles sold to third parties the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue in the period that miles are sold this represents services provided by the company to its business partners and relates primarily to the use of the companys logo and trademarks along with access to the companys mileage plan members commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2011  2010  and 2009  was 1382 million  1237 million  and 968 million  respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2011  we had approximately 124 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 6805 million  both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

   

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as our estimates of fair value change the amount we defer changes resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period a 1 increase in the estimated fair value of travel awards and related deferral rate would decrease commission revenue by approximately 24 million this amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place 

  

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimates of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage consider historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors a hypothetical 10 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 7 million effect on the liability 

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical travel redemption patterns 

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

   

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

pension plans 

  

accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 422 million  502 million  and 930 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively we expect the 2012  expense to be approximately 57 million 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2011  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 725 which is down 50 basis points from the expected rate at december 31 2010 this rate was developed using historical data the current value of the underlying assets as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2011  is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixedincome securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 725 to 675 would increase our estimated 2012  pension expense by approximately 64 million 

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 465  and 555  at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively the discount rate at december 31 2011  was 

  

determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 465  to 415 would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2011  by approximately 119 million and increase estimated 2012  pension expense by approximately 10 million 

  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants additionally benefits in our nonunion definedbenefit plans will be frozen january 1 2014 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 34 billion  of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

market risk – aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts both call options and swaps effectively cap our pricing for the crude oil and refining margin components limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with the call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts    the swap contracts do not require an upfront premium but do expose us to future cash outlays in the event actual prices are below the swap price during the hedge period we  believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2011  would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio by approximately 581 million and 461 million respectively 

our portfolio value of fuel hedge contracts was 1066  million at december 31 2011  compared to a portfolio value of 1313  million at december 31 2010  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2011  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

financial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the 

  

average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2011  would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 05 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements over the past several years our variablerate debt is approximately 23  of our total longterm debt at december 31 2011  compared to 20  at december 31 2010  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2011  interest income would increase by approximately 112 million

our airlines 

  

alaska 

  

alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and thirteen cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2010  we carried over 165 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations and we carry more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the number of passengers carried in 2010  alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2010 revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlelas vegas at december 31 2010  alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 114 jet aircraft compared to 115 aircraft as of december 31 2009  

  

  

  

alaska’s passenger traffic by market is presented below 



  

horizon 

  

horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 horizon was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves a number of cities in six states five destinations in canada and two destinations in mexico 

  

in 2010  horizon carried over 68 million revenue passengers approximately 91 of horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2010 were flown domestically primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california compared to 90 in 2009  the canada markets accounted for 8 of revenue passenger miles in both 2010 and 2009  flying to mexico accounted for about 1 of total traffic in 2010 compared to about 2 in 2009  

  

based on 2010 passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland spokane and boise based on revenues in 2010  the leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and portlandsan francisco at december 31 2010  horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 13 jets and 41 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under alaskas designator code in airline reservation systems 

  

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient competitive connections between most points served by their systems in 2010 and 2009  approximately 29 and 22 respectively of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska beginning january 1 2011 horizon will operate 100 of its flights under a capacity purchase arrangement with alaska whereby alaska will pay horizon an agreedupon rate based on the operated capacity 

  

industry conditions 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

  

  

2010 was a banner year in the industry in many respects many in the industry including us reported record earnings and passenger load factors the year was characterized by industry capacity discipline with an increase in passenger traffic this allowed for better pricing performance and stronger earnings in order to maximize revenue airlines continued to add or increase ancillary fees for checked baggage buyonboard items ticket fees etc these fees have significantly helped lift the industry out of its downturn and into the current recovery one significant area of concern however is the rising cost of fuel toward the latter half of the year and into the first part of 2011 

  

during 2010 our key initiative was to optimize revenue we continued to redeploy capacity to better match demand and the new markets we have entered are performing well our revenue initiatives combined with lower nonfuel unit costs our continued focus on customer service and our strong operational performance resulted in record financial results that again were among the best in the industry 

  

  



  

fuel 

  

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel prices have been extremely volatile over the past few years the price of crude oil spiked in 2008 with a high of nearly 150 per barrel in july 2008 and dropped significantly to an average of 62 per barrel in 2009 we saw upward pressure on fuel prices again in 2010 with an average crude oil price of just over 80 per barrel and currently over 85 for us a 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately 9 million of additional fuel cost annually said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 4 million per year 

  

we refer to the price we pay for fuel at the airport including applicable taxes as our “raw” fuel price raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting our airlines at a slight competitive disadvantage historically fuel costs have generally represented 10 to 15 of an airline’s operating costs but due to volatility in prices over the past few years fuel costs have been in the range of 20 to 40 of total operating costs both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results 

  

our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 27 in 2010  declined 43 in 2009  and increased 42 in 2008  

  

we use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts 

  



  

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet horizon is currently undergoing a transition to an allq400 turboprop fleet with expected completion in 2011 because of these changes alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 659 asmsg in 2006 to 765 asmsg in 2010  similarly horizon’s fuel burn has improved from 517 asmsg in 2006 to 561 asmsg in 2010  

  

these reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

  

marketing and competition 

  

alliances with other airlines 

  

we have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as code sharing on certain flights as shown in the table below alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

   

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination 

  

  

dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

  

our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2010 are as follows 



   

competition 

  

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

   

together alaska and horizon carry approximately 37 of all us domestic passenger traffic we compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes including southwest airlines united airlines delta air lines american airlines us airways jetblue airways virgin america allegiant and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers 

  

due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation in many markets including train bus and automobile transportation both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need or frequency of facetoface business meetings 

  

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

   

our sales by channel are as follows 



  

employees 

  

labor costs have historically made up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition new entrants into the us airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines 

  

we had 12039 9013 at alaska and 3026 at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2010  compared to 12440 9046 at alaska and 3394 at horizon at december 31 2009  wages salaries and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 43 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in both 2010 and 2009  

  

at december 31 2010  labor unions represented 82 of alaska’s and 47 of horizon’s employees our relations with our us labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

  

  

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2010 were as follows 



  

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2010 were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated 

  

the department of transportation dot the federal aviation administration faa and the transportation security administration tsa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

   

 11 

  

  

from time to time for alleged violations of fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

  

   

the department of justice and dot have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  

airline fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the dot maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve although air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts given to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

  

it is expected that there will be legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions alaska and horizon have transitioned or are transitioning to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets thereby greatly reducing our total emissions 

  

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

  

customer service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals and regulatory requirements including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds as a testament to our service alaska has won the jd power and associates award for highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the past three years 

  

in december 2009 the dot adopted new rules effective in april 2010 that set fines of as much as 27500 per violation when 

  

  

airlines leave passengers on the aircraft for more than three hours while on the ground or violate other rules aimed at consumer protection these new rules are in response to recent incidents involving other airlines that resulted in lengthy tarmac delays bills have been introduced in several states including the state of washington which propose to regulate airlines when operating in those specific states however we believe these bills would be preempted by federal law 

  

mileage plan program 

  

all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner a telephone company hotels car rental agencies and other businesses alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or to terminate the program 

  

mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after two years of inactivity in a member’s account over 88 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon in 2010 were subject to capacitycontrolled seating 

  

as of december 31 2010 and 2009  approximately 29 million and 30 million respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members of those eligible awards we estimate that approximately 88 will ultimately be redeemed for the years 2010  2009 and 2008  approximately 1666000 1451000 and 527000 oneway flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon in addition approximately 566000 roundtrip awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon in 2008 these awards represent approximately 9 8 and 9 for 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for the years 2010  2009  and 2008  approximately 167000 181000 and 214000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners in november 2008 we began charging a 25 administrative fee for awards redeemed on our airline partners 

  

we also have awards that allow members to redeem miles to purchase a ticket at a discounted fare our members redeemed approximately 430000 730000 and 620000 oneway equivalent awards under this program in 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively 

  

we sell mileage credits to our nonairline partners the vast majority of which are sold to our affinity credit card bank partner we defer a majority of the sales proceeds and recognize revenue when award transportation is provided 

  

other information 

  

seasonality and other factors 

  

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic it typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska however we have taken steps over the past few years to reduce the seasonality of our operations by adding flights to leisure destinations in hawaii and mexico 

  

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

  

   

• pricing initiatives by us and our competitors 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition to those factors listed above seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of the markets we serve experience inclement 

  

  

weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and reaccommodation of displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

  

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

  

insurance 

  

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties since the september 11 2001 attacks this insurance program excludes coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils so like other airlines the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the us government 

  

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors 

tableend

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

  

we have adopted an enterprise risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives within management ranks as well as align these risks with appropriate board level oversight these enterprise level identified risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 

  

safety compliance and operational excellence 

  

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

  

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel 

  

  

although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

  

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

  

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

  

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

due to our geographic area of operations we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

strategy 

  

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub in 2010  passengers to and from seattle accounted for 63 of our total passengers 

  

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take 

  

  

other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future in recent years alaska has subcontracted its heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

  

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

  

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

  

financial condition and financial markets 

  

our failure to successfully meet cost reduction goals could harm our business 

  

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital if we are unable to reduce our nonfuel unit costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted return on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future and therefore our financial results may suffer 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 27 and 21 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009  respectively significant increases in average fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations 

  

future increases in the price of jet fuel will harm our financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

  

economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

  

the 2008 and 2009 economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for air travel if a similar situation recurs we will likely need to adjust our capacity plans which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints 

  

although we have reduced our longterm debt balance significantly over the past year we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

  

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

   

   

   

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements we cannot be certain that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 

  

see “liquidity and capital resources” for more detailed information about our obligations and commitments 

  

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 

  

our definedbenefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk if market returns are poor in the future any future obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity poor market returns also lead to higher pension expense in our statement of operations the calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “critical accounting estimates” and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

aviation insurers could increase their premiums in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through september 30 2011 although the government may again extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

information technology 

  

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure of these systems or by their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our kiosk checkin terminals and other systems substantially all of our tickets 

  

  

are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website reservation system and checkin systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruption in changes to or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses and a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

  

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

  

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at alaskaaircom depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including credit card information a compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our customers’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial position and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

  

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business partners is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes 

  

brand and reputation 

  

the rebranding of the horizon brand may result in some loss of brand recognition 

  

with this change in structure in 2011 the external horizon brand will be phased out and the horizon fleet will be rebranded with alaska livery as the q400 fleet begins flying into new markets such as in the state of alaska we may be subject to certain operational disruptions or subject to severe weather conditions that does not impact jet operation as heavily furthermore with the horizon brand phase out there is a potential that we may lose some brand recognition from our customers in areas that horizon has historically served 

  

labor relations and labor strategy 

  

a significant increase in labor costs or change in key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 31 and 34 of our total operating expenses in 2010 and 2009  respectively as of december 31 2010  labor unions represented approximately 82 of alaska’s and 47 of horizon’s employees each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them although we have been successful in negotiating new contracts or extending existing contracts with all of our represented groups in recent years future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to many employees reduce employee engagement in our business and divert management’s attention from other projects and issues

most of our owned aircraft secure longterm debt arrangements or collateralize our revolving credit facility see further discussion in “liquidity and capital resources 

  

alaska’s leased 737400 and 737800 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2012 and 2016 and between 2015 and 2021 respectively horizon’s leased q400 and crj700 aircraft have expiration dates in 2018 and between 2018 and 2020 respectively horizon also has a q400 aircraft on shortterm lease which expires in may 2011 horizon also has 16 leased q200 aircraft and 3 leased crj700 aircraft that are subleased to thirdparty carriers alaska and horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the thenfairmarket value of the aircraft 

  

alaska completed its transition to an allboeing operating fleet during 2008 horizon expects to complete its transition to an allq400 operating fleet by june of 2011 the remaining 13 crj700 aircraft will be leased or subleased to a thirdparty carrier upon removal from the operating fleet

overview 

  

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand the company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes all statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in part i “item 1a risk factors” this overview summarizes the mda which includes the following sections 

  

   

   

   

   

   

year in review 

  

our 2010 consolidated pretax income was 4059 million compared to 2029 million in 2009  the 2030 million improvement in our pretax earnings was primarily due to the 4325 million increase in operating revenues partially offset by a 2428 million increase in aircraft fuel expense the increase in operating revenues was driven by a 98 increase in passenger traffic on relatively flat yield for the year fuel cost increased over the prior year primarily due to to a 27 increase in our raw fuel cost per gallon on relatively flat consumption for the year 

  

see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both alaska and horizon 

  

accomplishments and highlights 

  

accomplishments and highlights from 2010 include 

  

   

   

   

 25 

  

  

  

   

   

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

in january 2011 we entered into an aircraft purchase agreement with boeing to purchase 15 new b737 aircraft including two b737800 aircraft and 13 b737900er aircraft with deliveries beginning in late 2012 and continuing through 2014 the agreement also includes options to purchase 15 additional b737900er aircraft with delivery positions in 2016 and 2017 based on the current list prices the total value of this contract is approximately 13 billion 

  

update on labor negotiations 

  

both alaska and horizon have had success recently with amended bargaining agreements or contract extensions with a number of labor unions all of the new agreements or extensions ratified in 2010 include participation by the represented employees in air group’s performancebased pay pbp incentive plan as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors pbp is described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements with these recent contracts virtually all of our employees now participate in pbp 

  

alaska labor contracts 

alaska reached a tentative agreement in december 2010 on a threeyear contract with its largest represented group—the clerical office and passenger service employees this agreement was ratified in the first quarter of 2011 and included participation in the pbp incentive plan a 1500 signing bonus per employee and annual wage increases 

  

horizon labor contracts 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 horizon reached labor agreements with its pilots and mechanics both agreements include participation in the pbp plan for represented employees the pilot agreement includes a contract signing bonus and a provision for wage arbitration on the first and third anniversary date of the contract 

  

horizon restructuring and fleet transition 

  

in 2010 we made several structural changes to the horizon business as follows 

  

   

   

  

  

new markets 

  

in 2010 alaska added several new cities and nonstop routes to our overall network as follows 



  

in addition to these markets alaska began daily service between bellingham and honolulu in january 7 2011 and will begin daily service between san jose and kauai and between oakland and kauai in march 2011 

  

horizon also expanded service to include new nonstop routes between bellingham and portland six times weekly beginning on june 18 2010 and nonstop routes between between los angeles and san jose three times weekly beginning on august 23 2010 

  

the changes above when combined with the significant number of network changes over the last few years have diversified our network and made us less dependent on our historical markets in the state of alaska and up and down the west coast we believe our smaller size makes us more nimble than some of our larger competitors gives us a closer connection with our customers and allows us to identify and respond to market opportunities quickly 

  

stock repurchase 

  

in june 2009 our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 50 million of our common stock under this program we repurchased 1970326 shares of our common stock this program expired in june 2010 

  

in june 2010 our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 50 million of our common stock through december 31 2010 we repurchased 355000 shares of common stock for approximately 188 million under this program this program will expire in june 2011 

  

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run safe compliant and reliable operations at our airlines in addition to our primary objective our key initiative in 2011 is to maintain our focus on optimizing revenue our specific focus will be on the way we merchandise fares and ancillary products and services on our website and through mobile applications 

  

our biggest concern for 2011 is the rising cost of fuel however with our fuelefficient aircraft and our fuel hedge portfolio we believe we are better prepared to handle those rising costs than others in the industry 

  

for the first quarter of 2011 our advance booked load factors are up slightly compared to 2010 on significant increases in capacity 

  

results of operations 

  

2010 compared with 2009 

  

our consolidated net income for 2010 was a record 2511 million  or 683 per diluted share compared to net income of 

  

  

1216 million  or 336 per share in 2009  items that impact the comparability between the periods are as follows 

  

   

   

   

adjusted nongaap results and pershare amounts 

  

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because 

  

   

   

   

   

   

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

  

excluding the items noted above and as shown in the following table our consolidated net income for 2010 was a record 2626 million or 714 per diluted share compared to 887 million or 245 per diluted share in 2009  

  

individual subsidiary results 

  

our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers alaska and horizon reported pretax income of 4016 million and 76 million  respectively in 2010  financial and statistical data and an indepth discussion of the results of alaska and horizon are on the following pages for a reconciliation of these subsidiary results to the consolidated results of air group see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

alaska airlines financial and statistical data 



nm not meaningful 

  

  

alaska airlines 

  

alaska reported record pretax income of 4016 million in 2010 compared to pretax income of 1838 million in 2009  

  

excluding certain items as noted in the table below alaska would have reported record pretax income of 4049 million in 2010  compared to 1459 million in 2009  see the previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 



  

the discussion below outlines significant variances between the two periods 

  

alaska revenues 

  

total operating revenues increased 4206 million or 140  during 2010 compared to 2009  the changes are summarized in the following table 



  

operating revenues – mainline 

  

mainline passenger revenue for 2010 improved by 133 on a 56 increase in capacity and a 73 increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm compared to 2009 the increase in prasm was driven by a 23 rise in ticket yield and a 40 point increase in load factor compared to prior year due to an increase in passengers 

  

ancillary revenue included in passenger revenue increased from 1318 million in 2009 to 1797 million in 2010 the increase is primarily due to the implementation of our first checked bag fee in the third quarter of 2009 and growth in the number of passengers 

  

freight and mail revenue increased 104 million or 114  primarily as a result of higher volumes and yield and higher security and freight fuel surcharges 

  

other—net revenue increased 415 million or 222  from 2009  the increase is primarily due to mileage plan revenues rising by 318 million stemming from a larger number of miles sold to our affinity card partner and a contractual rate increase for those sold miles 

  

passenger revenue – purchased capacity 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity flying increased by 441 million or 153 compared to 2009 due to a 52 rise in capacity combined with a 96 increase in unit revenue unit revenue increased as a result of a 29 point improvement in load factor and a 54 increase in ticket yield 

  

alaska expenses 

  

for 2010  total operating expenses increased 1992 million or 72  compared to 2009 mostly as a result of higher aircraft 

  

  

fuel costs we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



  

mainline operating expenses 

  

total mainline operating expenses increased 1818 million or 73  during 2010 compared to the prior year the increase was mostly due to the 2116 million increase in aircraft fuel expense partially offset by charges for the pilot contract recorded in 2009 significant operating expense variances from 2009 are more fully described below 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits decreased by 254 million or 32  compared to 2009  the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



  

wages were relatively flat on a reduction in full time equivalent employees fte compared to 2009  wages have not declined in step with the fte reduction because of higher wage rates for the pilot group in connection with their new contract effective april 1 2009 and higher average wages for certain other employees after 2009 and early 2010 furloughs which are generally senioritybased however productivity as measured by the number of passengers per fte increased 94 compared to 2009 

  

the 267 decline in pension and other retirementrelated benefits is primarily due to a significant reduction in our definedbenefit pension cost driven by the improved funded status at the end of 2009 as compared to the previous year and the closing of the definedbenefit pension plans to new pilot entrants with their new contract in 2009 

  

medical benefits increased 55 from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in employee healthcare costs partially offset by a decrease in postretirement medical expense for the pilot group 

  

we expect wages and benefits to be higher in 2011 as compared to 2010 because of an increase in the number of ftes as we bring back furloughed employees to handle the expected growth in 2011 in addition we expect increases related to annual wages and the cost of healthcare 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay expense increased from 616 million in 2009 to 750 million in 2010  the increase is partially due to the fact that in 2010 our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our board more so than in 2009 in 2010 additional workgroups were included to the pbp plan resulting in higher earnings than the profit sharing plan in which they previously participated 

  

over the long term our plan is designed to pay at target although we may meet not meet or exceed those targets in any single year at target we estimate the pbp expense would be 39 million and aggregate incentive pay for all plans including opr would be approximately 51 million for 2011  which would be lower than in 2010  

  

  

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 2116 million or 385  compared to 2009  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

  

fuel gallons consumed increased 48  primarily as a result of a 24 increase in block hours partially offset by better fuel efficiency stemming from longer average stage lengths 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon rose 266 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs and refining margins 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period offset by the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

  

as noted above the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 28 million in 2010  compared to a net expense of 504 million in 2009  these amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement 

  

we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 280 in the first quarter of 2011 due to the rising cost of crude oil as oil prices are volatile we are unable to forecast the full year cost with any certainty 

  

  

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance declined by 108 million or 64  compared to the prior year primarily because of less expensive events lower component costs and decreased costs associated with aircraft returns we expect aircraft maintenance to remain relatively flat in 2011  

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent declined 119 million  or 109  compared to 2009 as a result of the return of five leased aircraft in 2010 we expect aircraft rent to be lower in 2011 as we annualize lease returns from 2010 we currently do not expect any leased aircraft to be returned in 2011 nor do we expect to lease any new aircraft 

  

landing fees and other rents 

  

landing fees and other rents increased 65 million  or 39  compared to 2009  the increase is attributable to higher rates in many airports across our network and more departures we expect landing fees to be higher in 2011 due to increased departure volume 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses increased by 198 million or 189  compared to 2009 as a result of higher credit card and travel agency commissions and ticket distribution costs resulting from the increase in passenger revenue 

  

we expect selling expenses will be higher in 2011 as compared to 2010  primarily due to higher revenuerelated expenses 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 100 million or 56  compared to 2009  this is primarily due to the four b737800 aircraft delivered in 2010 and a full period of depreciation for aircraft delivered in 2009  

  

we expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2011 due to the fullyear impact of aircraft that were delivered in 2010 and for expected 2011 aircraft deliveries 

  

food and beverage service 

  

food and beverage costs increased 75 million  or 157  from 2009 due to an increased number of passengers the higher cost of some of our fresh food items served on board and increased costs associated with food delivery we expect food and beverage costs to increase in 2011 due to increased passenger and departure volume 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses declined 53 million or 34  compared to the prior year the decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and lower personnel nonwage costs partially offset by higher property taxes we expect other operating expenses to be higher in 2011 

  

new pilot contract transition costs 

  

during 2009 in connection with a new fouryear contract alaskas pilots received a onetime aggregate bonus of 203 million we also recorded transition expense associated with establishing the new sickleave payout program which totaled 155 million bringing the total pilot contract transition cost to 358 million 

  

  

  

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

  

we have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs per asm and our unit costs excluding fuel and other noted items these amounts are included in casm but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our costreduction progress we believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we currently forecast our mainline costs per asm excluding fuel and other special items for the first quarter and full year of 2011 to be down 5 to 6 and 3 respectively compared to 2010  the expected decline in unit cost stems from expected capacity growth of 13 in the first quarter and 8 to 9 for the full year partially offset by higher nonfuel operating costs as described in the preceding pages historical cost per asm excluding fuel and other special items can be found in item 6 

  

  

“selected consolidated financial and operating data” 

  

purchased capacity costs 

purchased capacity costs increased 174 million compared to 2009  of the total  2744 million was paid to horizon under the capacity purchase agreement cpa for 14 billion asms this expense is eliminated in consolidation for 2011 the amount recorded as purchased capacity cost will increase significantly as horizon discontinued its brand flying effective january 1 2011 and moved to an allcpa model 

  

  

  

  

horizon air financial and statistical data 



  nm  not meaningful 

  

  

horizon air 

  

horizon reported pretax income of 76 million in 2010 compared to pretax income of 228 million in 2009  the decline in earnings is primarily due to higher aircraft fuel expense and higher restructuring and fleet transition costs partially offset by an increase in operating revenue 

  

excluding the items noted in the table below horizon would have reported pretax income of 228 million in 2010 compared to 77 million in 2009  see the previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 



  

horizon revenues 

  

during 2010 operating revenues increased 39 compared to 2009  horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the following table 



  

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below beginning january 1 2011 all of the flying performed by horizon will be under a cpa arrangement with alaska 



nm  not meaningful 

  

passenger revenue from horizon brand flying increased  126 million or 33  on a 108 increase in passenger unit revenues partially offset by a 67  decline in brand capacity the increase in unit revenue is due to a 20 point improvement in load factor and a 78  increase in ticket yield 

  

revenue from cpa flying performed on behalf of alaska totaled 2744 million during 2010 compared to 2617 million during 2009  the increase is primarily due to a 53  increase in capacity provided under this arrangement this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 

  

horizon expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased  420 million or 68  as compared to 2009  significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

  

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel increased  312 million or 286  compared to the same period in 2009  the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

nm  not meaningful 

  

fuel gallons consumed declined by 4 due to a 17 decline in capacity and improved fuel burn as we continue our transition to the more fuelefficient q400 aircraft the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 268  as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  nm  not meaningful 

  

the total net benefit recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 05 million in 2010  compared to a net expense of 103 million in 2009  these amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement 

  

restructuring and fleet transition costs 

  

we recorded 103 million in 2010 related to the removal of five crj700 aircraft from our operations under sublease or lease assignment to thirdparty carriers we also recorded 29 million of restructuring charges associated with the voluntary separation of a number of employees resulting from the decision to outsource the remaining aircraft heavy maintenance function to a third party 

  

in 2009 fleet transition costs associated with the removal of q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were 88 million as the final q200 aircraft were removed from operation 

  

all other operating expenses 

  

all other operating expenses increased by 64 million due primarily to a 42 million increase in aircraft maintenance expense driven by higher engine events and a 30 million increase in landing fees and rents from higher rates in many airports these increases were partially offset by a 29 million decline in aircraft rent due to the removal of five leased crj700 aircraft during the year and a 31 million decline in other operating expenses 

  

  

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

  

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 657 million in 2010 compared to 645 million in 2009  interest expense increased 40 million primarily due to the writeoff of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties on debt prepaid in 2010 partially offset by lower average interest rates on our variablerate debt and a lower average debt balance other—net nonoperating income expense improved by 66 million compared to 2009 primarily due to larger realized gains on the sale of marketable securities 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income for 2010 was 381 compared to 401 for 2009  the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 379 is due to nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards 

  

our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year depending on the magnitude of nondeductible expenses in proportion to pretax results 

  

  2009 compared with 2008 

  

our consolidated net income for 2009 was 1216 million or 336 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 1359 million or 374 per share in 2008 items that impact the comparability between the periods are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

  

adjusted nongaap results and pershare amounts 

  

excluding the items noted above and as shown in the following table our consolidated net income for 2009 was 887 million or 245 per diluted share compared to 44 million or 012 per diluted share in 2008 

  

alaska airlines 

  

alaska reported income before income taxes of 1838 million in 2009 compared to a loss before income taxes of 1533 million in 2008 

  

excluding certain items as noted in the table below alaska would have reported income before income taxes of 1459 million in 2009 compared to 252 million in 2008 see the previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 



  

the discussion below outlines significant variances between the two periods 

  

alaska revenues 

  

total operating revenues declined 2153 million or 67 during 2009 compared to 2008 the changes are summarized in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

  

  

  

  

operating revenues – mainline 

  

mainline passenger revenue in 2009 fell by 78 on a 44 reduction in capacity there was a 35 decline in prasm which was driven by a 60 drop in ticket yield compared to 2008 partially offset by a twopoint increase in load factor 

  

passenger revenues were also bolstered by the implementation of our firstcheckedbag fee in the third quarter of 2009 345 million and the fullyear impact of our secondcheckedbag fee implemented in the third quarter of 2008 partially offset by a decline in other fees that resulted from fewer passengers 

  

freight and mail revenue decreased 78 million or 79 primarily as a result of lower mail volumes and yield and lower freight fuel surcharges because of the decline in fuel prices in 2009 partially offset by higher freight volumes and better freight pricing 

  

other—net revenue increased 521 million or 385 from 2008 mileage plan revenue increased by 500 million primarily because of an increase in the rate paid to us by our credit card partner under the affinity card agreement and an increase in the number of miles needed to redeem a travel award 

  

passenger revenue – purchased capacity 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity flying fell by 124 million compared to 2008 because of a 26 decline in capacity combined with a 16 decrease in unit revenue compared to the prior year unit revenue dropped as a result of a 13point decline in load factor on flat ticket yield 

  

alaska expenses 

  

for 2009 total operating expenses decreased 5730 million or 171 compared to 2008 as a result of lower mainline operating costs most notably aircraft fuel and fleet transition charges partially offset by higher wages and benefits and new pilot contract transition costs 

  

we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 



  

mainline operating expenses 

  

total mainline operating expenses declined 5408 million or 178 during 2009 compared to 2008 significant operating expense variances from 2008 are more fully described below 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits were up 499 million or 67 compared to 2008 the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 



  

  

  

wages declined 12 on a 74 reduction in ftes compared to 2008 wages did not decline in step with the fte reduction because of higher wage rates for the pilot group in connection with their new contract and increased average wages for certain other employees stemming from higher average seniority 

  

the 671 increase in pension and other retirementrelated benefits was primarily due to a 450 million increase in our definedbenefit pension cost driven by the significant decline in the market value of pension assets at the end of 2008 

  

medical benefits increased 152 from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the postretirement medical expense for the pilot group in connection with their new contract and an increase in overall medical costs 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay expense increased from 158 million in 2008 to 616 million in 2009 the increase is partially due to the fact that in 2009 our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our board in 2008 our performance fell short of targets the increase can also be attributed to the addition of alaskas pilots flight attendants and mechanics to the pbp incentive plan 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense declined 6134 million or 528 compared to 2008 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 



nm  not meaningful 

  

fuel gallons consumed declined 87 primarily as a result of a 66 reduction in aircraft flight hours and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the transition to newer more fuelefficient b737800 aircraft in the second half of 2008 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon declined 432 as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices driven by lower crude oil costs and refining margins 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

  

as noted above the total net expense recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 504 million in 2009 compared to a net cash benefit of 1018 million in 2008 these amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement the decrease is primarily due to the significant drop in crude oil prices from 2008 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance increased by 193 million or 128 compared to the prior year primarily because of a higher average cost of airframe maintenance events and a new powerbythehour pbh maintenance agreement on our b737700 and b737900 aircraft engines partially offset by the benefits of our fleet transition as we have replaced all of our aging md80s 

  

  

with newer b737800s and lower pbh costs associated with our 737400 aircraft engines that resulted from a decline in flight hours 

  

contracted services 

  

contracted services declined by 53 million or 41 compared to 2008 as a result of the reduction in the number of flights operated throughout our system to ports where vendors are used and a reduction in project contract labor 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses declined by 113 million or 97 compared to 2008 as a result of lower revenuerelated expenses such as credit card costs travel agency commissions and ticket distribution costs that resulted from the decline in passenger traffic mileage plan expenses were also lower because the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel was lower because of the decline in fuel costs these declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 126 million or 76 compared to 2008 this is primarily due to the ten b737800 aircraft delivered in 2009 partially offset by the saleleaseback of six b737800 aircraft in the first quarter of 2009 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses declined 151 million or 89 compared to the prior year the decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and flight crewrelated costs such as hotels and perdiems 

  

new pilot contract transition costs 

  

as mentioned previously we recorded 358 million in connection with the new fouryear contract ratified by alaska’s pilots in the second quarter 

  

restructuring charges and fleet transition costs 

  

in the third quarter of 2008 we announced work force reductions among union and nonunion employees the affected nonunion employees were terminated in the third quarter resulting in a 16 million severance charge for union personnel we recorded an 113 million charge in 2008 

  

during 2008 we retired four md80 aircraft that were under longterm lease arrangements and placed them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility the 475 million charge in 2008 represented the remaining discounted lease payments under the lease contracts and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the minimum return conditions under the lease requirements 

  

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

  

casm excluding fuel and noted items increased from the prioryear period because of the increase in wages and benefits and other expenses as discussed above partially offset by a 44 reduction in capacity 

  

  

  

purchased capacity costs 

  

purchased capacity costs decreased 322 million compared to 2008 of the total 2617 million was paid to horizon under the cpa for 14 billion asms this expense is eliminated in consolidation 

  

horizon air 

  

horizon reported pretax income of 228 million in 2009 compared to a pretax loss of 558 million in 2008 the improvement is primarily due to declines in aircraft fuel costs and nonfuel operating expenses partially offset by a 795 million decline in operating revenues 

  

excluding the items noted in the table below horizon would have reported pretax income of 77 million in 2009 compared to a pretax loss of 104 million in 2008 see the previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 



  

horizon revenues 

  

during 2009 operating revenues decreased 108 compared to 2008 horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the following table 



  

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below 



nm  not meaningful 

  

passenger revenue from horizon brand flying fell 473 million or 110 on a 132 reduction in brand capacity partially offset by a 28 improvement in unit revenue the increase in unit revenue was due to the slight improvements in both load factor and ticket yield 

  

revenue from cpa flying performed on behalf of alaska totaled 2617 million during 2009 compared to 2937 million during 2008 the decrease was primarily due to a 22 reduction in capacity provided under this arrangement and a significant decline in the associated fuel cost which was reimbursed by alaska this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 

  

horizon expenses 

  

total operating expenses decreased 1611 million or 208 as compared to 2008 the sharp decline in fuel costs was the primary driver of the overall decrease significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

  

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits declined 89 million or 46 compared to 2008 the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 

  

  

wages declined 7 primarily as a result of a 106 decline in the number of fulltime equivalent employees partially offset by slightly higher wages per employee the increase in average wages per employee is due to a higher average employee seniority level as furloughs involved less senior employees 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay expense increased to 144 million during 2009 from 56 million in 2008 of which 86 million and 1 million was related to pbp in 2009 and 2008 respectively variable pay increased for the same performance reasons cited in the alaska discussion and the addition of horizon’s flight attendants and nonrepresented employees into air group’s pbp plan 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel declined 1269 million or 538 compared to the same period in 2008 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

nm  not meaningful 

  

the 102 reduction in gallons consumed is primarily a function of the capacity reductions in 2009 compared to the prior year 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon declined by 435 as a result of the drop in crude oil prices and refining margins 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 



nm  not meaningful 

  

the total net expense recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 103 million in 2009 compared to a net cash benefit of 209 million in 2008 these amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement 

  

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent expense declined 122 million or 214 as a result of the complete transition out of the q200 fleet all of which were leased and the sublease of two crj700 aircraft in late 2008 

  

fleet transition costs 

  

fleet transition costs associated with the removal of q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were 88 million during 2009 compared to 102 million in 2008 all q200 aircraft have been removed from the operating fleet 

  

during 2008 as a result of our decision to retire the crj700 fleet earlier than expected we recorded a 55 million impairment charge associated with the two owned crj700 aircraft and related spare parts 67 million associated with a net loss on the sublease arrangement for two leased crj700 aircraft and a 13 million severance charge associated with the fleet reduction 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 



nm  not meaningful 

  

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 645 million in 2009 compared to 410 million in 2008 interest income declined 98 million compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns partially offset by a higher average balance of cash and marketable securities interest expense declined 05 million on lower average interest rates on our variablerate debt on a relatively stable average debt balance capitalized interest was 156 million lower than in 2008 because of lower advance aircraft purchase deposits and the deferred future aircraft deliveries 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income or loss for 2009 was 401 compared to 363 for 2008 the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our 2009 marginal tax rate of approximately 379 is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

  

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

  

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on our airlines and many of our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our travel partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

  

for miles earned by passengers who fly on us or our travel partners we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense for the obligation to provide travel in the future for miles sold to third parties the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue in the period that miles are sold and represents services provided by the company to its business partners and relates primarily to the use of the companys logo and trademarks along with access to the companys mileage plan members commission revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 1237 million 968 million and 570 million respectively the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on one of our airlines and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2010  we had approximately 117 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 6739 million both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

  

   

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as our estimates of fair value change the amount we defer changes resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given period a 1 increase in the estimated fair value of travel awards and related deferral rate would decrease commission revenue by approximately 2 million this amount would instead be recognized in a future period when award travel takes place 

  

   

the liability for outstanding mileage plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award our estimates of the number of miles that will not be redeemed breakage consider historical activity in our members’ accounts and other factors a hypothetical 10 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 70 million effect on the liability 

  

   

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical travel redemption patterns 

  

   

the cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

  

   

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often 

  

  

substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

pension plans 

  

accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 502 million  930 million  and 480 million in 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively we expect the 2011 expense to be approximately 44 million 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2010  we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 775 this rate was developed using historical data the current value of the underlying assets as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2010 is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixedincome securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 775 to 725 would increase our estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately 57 million 

  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 555 and 585 at december 31 2010 and 2009  respectively the discount rate at december 31 2010 was determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 555 to 505 would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2010 by approximately 977 million and increase estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately 91 million 

  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2010  we had approximately 31 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

  

in 2008 horizon announced plans to ultimately exit its crj700 fleet and transition to an allq400 fleet as a result of the decision we determined that the two owned crj700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of 55 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 

  

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft 

  

  

prospective accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 200913 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force this update provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist how the deliverables should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated to one or more units of accounting this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method this accounting standard is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 this guidance is effective for us on january 1 2011 and will change our accounting for recognition of revenue associated with frequent flyer credits management does not believe that there will be an immediate significant impact of this new standard on the companys financial position results of operations cash flows or disclosures 

  

recently the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued a number of proposed accounting standards updates asus those proposed asus are as follows 

  

   

   

these proposed asus are currently in comment period and are subject to change there are no effective dates assigned to these proposals 

  

in july 2010 the fasb also issued an initial draft of new financial statement presentation requirements these new requirements as currently drafted would substantially change the way financial statements are presented by disaggregating information in financial statements to explain the components of its financial position and financial performance these changes will impact the presentation of the financial statements only and are not expected to impact the companys overall financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

   

   

   

   

because of the recent economic recession we intentionally increased our cash and marketable securities to current levels roughly 32 of trailing 12 months revenues in 2010 we paid off outstanding debt associated with six b737800 aircraft and a portion of a seventh aircraft loan totaling 1692 million subsequent to the end of 2010 we paid off outstanding balances on two additional aircraft loans totaling 518 million in addition we repurchased 451 million of our common stock in 2010 and have 312 million remaining to repurchase under our existing 50 million board authorization finally we made a voluntary contribution to our definedbenefit pension plans of 100 million in december 2010 bringing our total pension contributions to 1456 million in 2010 we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

  

  

  

  

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 

  

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in us government securities certain assetbacked obligations and corporate debt securities we do not invest in equities or auctionrate securities as of december 31 2010  we had a 128 million net unrealized gain on our 12 billion cash and marketable securities balance 

  

our overall investment strategy for our marketable securities portfolio has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and is continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

  

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 



  

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

  

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2010  net cash provided by operating activities was 5537 million  compared to 2925 million during 2009  the 2612 million increase was primarily driven by higher revenues growth in the air traffic liability and a decline in paid income taxes compared to the prior year the increases were partially offset by the payment of 2009 incentive pay in the first quarter of 2010 which was significantly larger than the payment of 2008 incentive pay in 2009 

  

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations but historically have consumed substantially all of that cash plus additional debt proceeds for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2010 however we had much lower capital expenditures than in the past several years due to fewer aircraft deliveries 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures and to a lesser extent purchases and sales of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 2952 million during 2010  compared to 6574 million in 2009  our capital expenditures were 1830 million  or 2554 million lower than in 2009 due to fewer aircraft purchases and advance deposits 

  

we currently expect capital expenditures for 2011 to be as follows in millions 



  

the expected increase in capital expenditures from 2010 is due to payments associated with the deliveries of three b737800 aircraft eight q400 aircraft and the advance deposits related to the new boeing aircraft order discussed later under aircraft purchase commitments we preliminarily expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately 370 million 

  

cash provided by financing activities 

  

net cash used by financing activities was 3332 million during 2010 compared to net cash provided of 2460 million during 2009  the change is primarily due to proceeds from the saleleaseback transactions on six b737800 aircraft and debt proceeds 

  

  

in 2009 compared to no borrowings in 2010 combined with 1692 million of debt prepayment in 2010 additionally we repurchased 451 million of our common stock in 2010 compared to 238 million repurchased in 2009 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

we terminated our previous 185 million credit facility effective march 30 2010 that facility was replaced with two new 100 million credit facilities both facilities have variable interest rates based on libor plus a specified margin borrowings on one of the 100 million facilities which expires in march 2013 are secured by aircraft borrowings on the other 100 million facility which expires in march 2014 are secured by certain accounts receivable spare engines spare parts and ground service equipment there are no outstanding balances on these facilities at december 31 2010  we have no immediate plans to borrow using either of these facilities see note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

predelivery payment facility 

  

we terminated our predelivery payment facility in the second quarter of 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at the time of termination see note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

in january 2011 we executed an aircraft purchase agreement with boeing for 15 new b737 aircraft two 737800 aircraft and 13 new b737900er aircraft with deliveries starting late in 2012 and going through 2014 the agreement also includes options for 15 additional b737900er aircraft with delivery positions in 2016 and 2017 the firm orders mentioned above were inclusive of the conversion of eleven existing options 

  

for purposes of the aircraft purchase commitment table below we are including the recent aircraft transactions and their related obligations all other obligations are as of december 31 2010  overall we had firm orders to purchase 36 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately 11509 million  as set forth below alaska has options to acquire 42 additional b737s and horizon has options to acquire 10 q400s 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year including the january aircraft order 



 includes predelivery payments to boeing and bombardier as well as final aircraft payments 

  

we expect to pay for the three b737800 aircraft deliveries in 2011 with cash on hand and the eight q400 aircraft with longterm debt financing we expect to pay for firm orders beyond 2011 and the option aircraft if exercised through internally generated cash longterm debt or operating lease arrangements 

  

  

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2010  the aircraft purchase commitments in the table below do not reflect the january 2011 aircraft order 



   

pension obligations 

  

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans which could be approximately 35 million to 50 million per year based on our historical funding practice although there is no minimum required contribution in 2011 in both 2010 and 2009 we made yearend voluntary supplemental pension contributions of 100 million bringing the funding total in both years to approximately 300 million the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 2003 million at december 31 2010 compared to 2729 million at december 31 2009  this results in a 851 funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 769 funded as of december 31 2009  

  

los angeles international airport improvements 

  

in 2009 we announced plans to move from terminal 3 to terminal 6 at los angeles international airport lax as part of this move we have agreed to manage and fund up to 175 million of the project during the design and construction phase the project is estimated to cost approximately 250 million and is expected to be completed in 2012 we expect los angeles world airports and the transportation security administration to reimburse us for the majority of the construction costs either during the course of or upon the completion of construction we are currently working with the city of los angeles and los angeles world airports on a funding agreement and expect to have it finalized in the near future we anticipate that our proprietary share will be approximately 25 million of the total cost of the project as of december 31 2010 we capitalized 34 million associated with this project which represents total project costs to date 

  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement under another such agreement we would be obligated to maintain a reserve if our cash balance fell below 350 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

effect of inflation and price changes 

  

inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income and did not have such an effect in the last three fiscal years 

  

  

  

  

return on invested capital 

  

we strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business our target return on invested capital roic is 10 we surpassed this goal in 2010 but have not historically reached this threshold on average over our business cycle our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers which we believe is a 10 average return

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

market risk – aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts we utilize the contracts in our portfolio as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of fuel prices allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing fuel prices with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2010 would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio by approximately 566 million and 475 million respectively 

  

our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth 1313 million at december 31 2010  for which we have paid 1086 million of premiums to counterparties compared to a portfolio value of 1170 million at december 31 2009  we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2010  

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

financial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2010 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 08 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements over the past several years our variablerate debt is approximately 20 of our total longterm debt at december 31 2010 compared to 22 at december 31 2009  

  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2010  interest income would increase by approximately 119 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of december 31 2010  an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer collectively our “certifying officers” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures these disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our current and periodic reports filed with or submitted to the securities and exchange commission the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our certifying officers on a timely basis our certifying officers concluded based on their evaluation that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2010

alaska air group inc 

we have audited alaska air group incs internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso alaska air group incs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting included in item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion alaska air group inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of alaska air group inc and subsidiaries as of december 31 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 and our report dated february 22 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

ala ska 

  

alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and twelve cities in the midcontinental and eastern us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from other cities as well 

  

in 2009 we carried 156 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations and we carry more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the number of passengers carried in 2009 alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2009 revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlesan diego at december 31 2009 alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 115 jet aircraft compared to 110 aircraft as of december 31 2008 

alaska’s passenger traffic by market is presented below

horizon air industries is a washington corporation that first began service was incorporated in 1981 and was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves a number of cities in seven states five cities in canada and two cities in mexico 

  

in 2009 horizon carried 68 million revenue passengers approximately 90 of horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2009 were flown domestically primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california compared to 91 in 2008 the canada markets accounted for 8 of revenue passenger miles in both 2009 and 2008 flying to mexico accounted for about 2 of total traffic in 2009 compared to less than 1 in 2008 

based on 2009 passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland boise and spokane based on revenues in 2009 the leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and boiseseattle at december 31 2009 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 18 jets and 40 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under the alaska airlines designator code in airline reservation systems 

  

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient competitive connections between most points served by their systems in 2009 and 2008 approximately 22 and 23 respectively of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska

general 

the airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

2009 was a year plagued by economic woes and the worst recession the united states has experienced since the great depression the result was a steep decline in the demand for air travel causing a doubledigit percentage decline in unit revenue and passenger count across the industry in response to this decline and the high price of oil in 2008 airlines reduced domestic capacity by approximately 7 in 2009 compared to 2008 the significant decline in the average price of jet fuel from its 2008 high helped mitigate an otherwise difficult year for the industry in order to maximize revenue to help offset the demand decline airlines continued down the path of adding or increasing ancillary fees for checked baggage buyonboard items ticket fees etc these fees helped to recover some of the lost revenue from the decline in traffic but certainly not all of it 

during 2009 our key initiative was to optimize revenue we reduced and redeployed capacity to better match demand and the new markets we have entered are performing well our revenue initiatives combined with lower fuel costs our continued focus on customer service and our strong operational performance resulted in financial results that significantly improved from 2008 and were among the best in the industry 

 

 

  

fuel 

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel prices have been extremely volatile over the past few years the price of crude oil averaged over 106 per barrel in 2008 with a high of nearly 150 per barrel in july 2008 the average price in 2009 was a more moderate 62 per barrel although that price is still historically high for us a 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately 9 million of additional fuel cost annually a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 35 million per year 

we refer to the price we pay for fuel at the airport including applicable taxes as our “raw” fuel price raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting our airlines at a slight competitive disadvantage historically fuel costs have generally represented 10 to 15 of an airline’s operating costs but due to volatility in prices over the past few years fuel costs have been in the range of 20 to 40 of total operating costs both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results 

as depicted in the charts below our average raw fuel cost per gallon declined 43 in 2009 and increased 42 and 8 in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

we use crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts 

 

 

  

we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft also helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices alaska operates an allboeing 737 fleet at horizon the longterm goal is to transition to an allq400 turboprop fleet because of these changes alaska’s fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved from 659 asmsg in 2006 to 759 asmsg in 2009 similarly horizon’s fuel burn has improved from 517 asmsg in 2006 to 548 asmsg in 2009 

these reductions have not only reduced our fuel cost but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our operations emit 

mark eting and competition 

a lli ances with other airlines 

we have marketing alliances with several airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as code sharing on certain flights as shown in the table below alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 

  

 

 

  

 

  

 

  

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

 6  

our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2009 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

together alaska and horizon carry approximately 35 of all us domestic passenger traffic we compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes including southwest airlines united airlines delta air lines continental airlines american airlines us airways jetblue airways virgin america allegiant and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers 

due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation in many markets including train bus and automobile transportation both carriers to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have resulted in a change in business travel 

t ick et distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

empl oyees 

  

labor costs have historically made up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition new entrants into the us airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines 

 7  

we had 12440 9046 at alaska and 3394 at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2009 compared to 14143 10250 at alaska and 3893 at horizon as of december 31 2008 wages salaries and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 43 and 40 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

at december 31 2009 labor unions represented 82 of alaska’s and 46 of horizon’s employees our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board nmb to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 

 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2009 were as follows

regu lation 

  

gen eral 

  

the airline industry is highly regulated 

the department of transportation dot and the federal aviation administration faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

 

 

the aviation and transportation security act the security act generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures pursuant to the security act the transportation security administration tsa is responsible for aviation security the security act imposes a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures in addition carriers are required to pay an amount to the tsa to cover the cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 we paid 126 million each year to the tsa for this security charge in 2009 2008 and 2007 

the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  

a irlin e fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the dot maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve although air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts given to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  

e nvir onmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations we maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

it is expected that the current federal administration will likely move forward with legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions we do not believe legislation is necessary to motivate airlines to reduce fuel burn and in turn reduce emissions for example alaska and horizon have transitioned or are transitioning to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets thereby greatly reducing our total emissions 

 10  

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

c ustom er service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds all of our employees are required to periodically attend our customer experience workshop to enhance our customer service focus and ultimately improve the experience our customers have when traveling with us 

  

in december 2009 the dot adopted new rules effective in april 2010 that set fines of as much as 27500 per passenger when airlines leave passengers on the aircraft for more than three hours while on the ground these new rules are in response to recent incidents involving other airlines that resulted in lengthy tarmac delays bills have been introduced in several states including the state of washington which propose to regulate airlines when operating in those specific states however we believe these bills would be preempted by federal law we do not believe these bills are necessary 

mileag e plan program 

all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner a grocery store chain a telephone company hotels car rental agencies and other businesses alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or to terminate the program 

mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after two years of inactivity in a member’s account over 80 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon in 2009 were subject to capacitycontrolled seating 

as of december 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 30 million and 34 million respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members of those eligible awards we estimate that approximately 88 will ultimately be redeemed for the years 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 1190000 685000 and 600000 roundtrip awards and 260000 410000 and 250000 oneway flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon these awards represent approximately 150 93 and 70 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for the years 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 181000 214000 and 243000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners in november 2008 we began charging a 25 fee for awards redeemed on our airline partners 

  

we also have awards that allow for redemption of onehalf the mileage redemption rate plus 50 of the fare for eligible award travel our members redeemed approximately 730000 620000 and 560000 oneway equivalent awards under this program in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

we sell mileage credits to our nonairline partners we defer a majority of the sales proceeds and recognize revenue when award transportation is provided 

other information 

s eason ality and other factors 

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic it typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska 

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include   

 

 11  

• pricing initiatives by us and our competitors 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

in addition to those factors listed above seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and reaccommodation of displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

insura nce 

  

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties since the september 11 2001 attacks this insurance program excludes coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils so like other airlines the company has purchased war risk coverage for such events through the us government 

  

we believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of aviation insurance

 ite m 1arisk factors 

tableend 

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline we operate in a continually changing business environment in this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

economy and finance 

the current economic climate has impacted demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations if the environment does not improve 

  

the recent economic recession resulted in a decline in demand for air travel if the economic climate does not improve and traffic does not improve as we expect we will likely need to adjust our capacity plans which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 21 and 36 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively significant increases in average fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations 

future increases in the price of jet fuel will harm our financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints 

  

we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

  

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

 

  

 

 

 

 12  

although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements we cannot be certain that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 

see “liquidity and capital resources” on page 44 for more detailed information about our obligations and commitments 

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 

our definedbenefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk if market returns are poor in the future as they were in 2008 any future obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity poor market returns also lead to higher pension expense in our statement of operations the calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “critical accounting estimates” on page 42 and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

aviation insurers could increase their premiums in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through august 31 2010 although the government may again extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

safety compliance and operational excellence 

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us dot the tsa and the faa have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

 13  

if we do not maintain the privacy and security of customerrelated information we could damage our reputation incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 

we receive retain and transmit certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at alaskaaircom depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including credit card information a compromise of our security systems or those of other business partners that results in our customers’ personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial position and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations 

additionally the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business partners is regulated at the international federal and state levels privacy and information security laws and regulations change and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes 

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control 

a local dam in the kent valley near the seattletacoma international airport is partly compromised many of the services necessary for the operation of our airlines are located in the valley eg fuel supply power catering reservations call centers etc if the area experiences heavy rains flooding could occur and our operations could be disrupted the army corps of engineers estimates that the dam will be repaired within three to five years we have contingency plans in place and are continuing to monitor the situation 

other conditions that might impact our operations include 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

due to our geographic area of operations we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

strategy 

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub in 2009 passengers to and from seattle accounted for 64 of our total passengers 

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 14  

our failure to successfully meet cost reduction goals at both alaska and horizon could harm our business 

  

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital however with our capacity reductions in 2009 and increased costs in areas such as wages and benefits we experienced a 10 increase in nonfuel unit cost at alaska and a 6 increase at horizon if we are unable to reduce our nonfuel unit costs over the longterm and achieve targeted profitability we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future and therefore our financial results may suffer 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future in recent years alaska has subcontracted its heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all although we believe that our vendor oversight and quality control is among the best in the industry if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many of its aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

information technology 

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure of these systems or by their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our kiosk checkin terminals and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website or our airport kiosks we depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website reservation system and checkin systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruption in changes to or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses and a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

brand and reputation 

a significant increase in labor costs or change in key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 34 and 25 of our total operating expenses in 2009 and 2008 respectively as of december 31 2009 labor unions represented approximately 82 of alaska’s and 46 of horizon’s employees each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them although we have been successful in negotiating new contracts or extending existing contracts with a number of workgroups recently future uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to many employees reduce employee engagement in our business and divert management’s attention from other projects and issues 

 15  

horizon is currently in negotiations with the ibt on a new pilot agreement and has been since the contract first became amendable in september 2006 in january 2010 horizon and the ibt filed separate requests for assistance from the nmb in our ongoing negotiations factoring in pay rates and productivity measures we believe our pilot unit costs at horizon are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft we operate 

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners” including but not limited to american airlines and delta air lines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage

most of our owned aircraft secure longterm debt arrangements or collateralize our revolving credit facility see further discussion in “liquidity and capital resouces” on page 44 

alaska’s leased 737400 737700 and 737800 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2010 and 2016 in 2010 and between 2015 and 2021 respectively alaska has four md80 aircraft one owned and three under longterm lease arrangements through 2012 currently in temporary storage horizon’s leased q400 and crj700 aircraft have expiration dates in 2018 and between 2018 and 2020 respectively horizon also has 16 leased q200 aircraft and two leased crj700 aircraft that are subleased to thirdparty carriers alaska and horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the thenfairmarket value of the aircraft 

  

alaska completed its transition to an allboeing operating fleet during 2008 horizon’s longterm goal is to transition to an allq400 operating fleet as market conditions have hindered the remarketing efforts on the crj700 aircraft and as horizon has successfully deferred future q400 deliveries the fleet transition plan has been delayed until market conditions improve 

 16  

the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet counts for alaska and horizon as of the end of each quarter in 2010 this plan assumes that we are able to remarket three crj700 aircraft in the first half of 2010 given current market conditions there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so

grievance with international association of machinists 

  

in june 2005 the international association of machinists iam filed a grievance under its collective bargaining agreement cba alleging that alaska violated the cba by among other things subcontracting the ramp service operation in seattle the dispute was referred to an arbitrator and hearings on the grievance commenced in january 2007 with a final hearing date in august 2007 in february 2010 the arbitrator issued a final decision the decision does not require alaska to alter the existing subcontracting arrangements for ramp service in seattle the award sustains the right to subcontract other operations in the future so long as the requirements of the cba are met the award imposes monetary remedies which have not been fully calculated but are not expected to be material

year in review 

our 2009 consolidated pretax income was 2029 million compared to a pretax loss of 2132 million in 2008 the 4161 million improvement in our pretax earnings was primarily due to the 7024 million decline in aircraft fuel costs and other nonfuel operating costs partially offset by a 2628 million decline in operating revenues the decline in fuel cost was substantially driven by the 43 reduction in the raw cost of fuel per gallon the 72 decline in operating revenues can be attributed to the following

update on labor negotiations 

  

both alaska and horizon have had success recently with new bargaining agreements or contract extensions with a number of represented employees all of the new agreements or extensions ratified in 2009 include participation by the represented employees in air group’s performancebased pay pbp incentive plan as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors pbp is described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements our ultimate goal is to include all air group employees in pbp in order to have common goals and targets that everyone is working together to achieve 

new alaska pilot contract 

on may 19 2009 alaska’s pilots represented by the air line pilots association ratified a new fouryear contract this negotiated agreement replaces the contract that had been in place since may 1 2005 the terms of the 2005 contract were the result of an arbitrator’s decision and included immediate wage reductions that averaged approximately 26 across the pilot group work rule changes and higher employee health care contributions 

the significant terms of the new contract are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

pilots received a onetime bonus of 203 million in the aggregate following ratification of the contract the transition expense associated with establishing the sickleave payout program described above was 155 million these items have been combined and reported in 2009 as “new pilot contract transition costs” in the consolidated statements of operations 

contract extensions at alaska 

in march 2009 alaska’s flight attendants represented by the afa ratified a twoyear contract extension the contract will become amendable in april 2012 as part of the contract flight attendants will receive a 15 pay increase on may 1 2010 and may 1 2011 and will participate in pbp the flight attendants received a bonus upon ratification of the contract totaling 20 million in the aggregate 

in august 2009 alaska and its aircraft technicians reached an agreement on a twoyear contract extension the extended contract which becomes amendable on october 17 2011 provides technicians with 15 pay scale increases in october 2009 and 2010 technicians now also participate in pbp the technicians received a bonus upon ratification of the contract totaling 13 million in the aggregate 

in december 2009 alaska’s ramp service and stores agents represented by the iam ratified a twoyear extension of their collective bargaining agreement which will now become amendable on july 19 2012 this agreement includes participation in pbp a 15 pay increase in june 2010 and 2011 and a signing bonus of approximately 05 million in the aggregate 

alaska’s clerical office and passenger service employees cops also represented by the iam rejected a twoyear extension proposal nearly identical to the terms of the proposal ratified by the ramp service employees and stores agents as a result cops employees are the only remaining work group at alaska besides station personnel in mexico that participate in a profitsharing plan other than pbp 

horizon labor contracts 

horizon’s dispatchers represented by the twu ratified a new contract in july 2009 expiring in october 2010 this contract includes a transition from the former profitsharing plan to pbp 

in december 2009 horizon’s flight attendants represented by the afa ratified a new twoyear contract the agreement includes participation in pbp in 2009 and beyond at least a 3 pay increase over the life of the contract and a signing bonus of 03 million in the aggregate 

historically only a small percentage of nonrepresented employees at horizon participated in the pbp plan to better align the incentive plans for this group with other horizon and alaska employees horizon has also added all remaining nonrepresented employees approximately 1400 people to the pbp plan in 2009 

 23  

horizon is currently in negotiations with its pilots and aircraft technicians horizon and the ibt recently filed separate requests for assistance for the nmb in the ongoing pilot contract negotiations horizon’s aircraft technicians voted in 2009 to be represented by the ibt they were previously represented by the aircraft mechanics fraternal association horizon’s pilots and mechanics remain in a profitsharing plan program other than pbp 

horizon fleet transition 

  

horizon’s longterm goal is to transition to an allq400 fleet in the first quarter of 2009 horizon removed the final six q200 aircraft from operations these aircraft were disposed of in the last six months of 2009 and the related lease agreements were terminated we recorded charges of 88 million in 2009 associated with removing these aircraft from operation 

  

although we have been actively pursuing various alternatives to dispose of our 18 crj700 aircraft in the most economically feasible way the current economic conditions have hindered the remarketing efforts as a result the transition to an allq400 fleet will be delayed and we will continue to operate the crj700 aircraft in our operating fleet we have successfully deferred 2010 and 2011 q400 deliveries into future years to better manage our fleet size and capacity plans 

new mileage plan affinity card agreement 

  

in june 2009 we revised our mileage plan affinity credit card agreement with bank of america this revised agreement enhances the economics of our mileage plan program and provides for among other things an increase in the rate at which we sell miles to the bank this revised agreement was effective january 1 2009 and expires on december 31 2014 

first bag service charge 

  

in 2009 we joined nearly all major domestic carriers in charging for a first checked bag the 15 service charge began july 7 2009 this fee does not apply to our mvp or mvp gold mileage plan members for those traveling solely with the state of alaska or for certain other passengers this service charge generated 474 million of incremental revenue in the last six months of 2009 

new baggage service guarantee 

  

concurrent with the first bag service charge we introduced a guarantee to compensate passengers if their bags are not at the baggage claim within 25 minutes after their flight parks at the gate passengers have the choice of 2500 mileage plan miles or a 25 voucher that can be used on a future flight this guarantee is for all passengers with luggage including those not subject to the bag service charge we believe that we are the only airline that offers this guarantee to customers to date the cost of providing this guarantee has been minimal as our baggage performance has been excellent 

new markets 

  

in 2009 alaska added several new cities and nonstop routes to our overall network those new routes are 

 

horizon also announced expanded seasonal service to mammoth lakes calif from san jose reno seattle and portland the flights will operate from december 17 2009 to april 11 2010 

stock repurchase 

  

in june 2009 our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 50 million of our common stock at which time the stock price was 1560 through december 31 2009 we had repurchased 1324578 shares of common stock for approximately 238 million under this program this program expires in june 2010 

outlook 

  

our primary focus every year is to run safe compliant and reliable operations at our airlines in addition to our primary objective in 2010 our key initiative is to maintain our focus on optimizing revenue our specific focus will be on the way we merchandise fares and ancillary products and services as well as broader employee involvement in our marketing efforts in addition to the focus on revenue both of our airlines have initiatives under way designed to reduce costs alaska is focused on improving productivity and controlling overhead horizon aims to reduce maintenance costs and pilot labor costs 

our fourth quarter 2009 revenue performance marked the first quarteroverquarter improvement in the top line in 2009 providing a solid outlook as we move into 2010 

for the first quarter our advance booked load factors are up significantly at both alaska and horizon although we expect the higher load factors which were driven by deep price discounting will be offset by a decline in yields resulting in only modest unit revenue increases in the first quarter

results of operations 

  

2 00 9 compared with 2008 

our consolidated net income for 2009 was 1216 million or 336 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 1359 million or 374 per share in 2008 items that impact the comparability between the periods are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjusted nongaap results and pershare amounts 

we believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although we are presenting these nongaap amounts for the reasons above investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are nonrecurring infrequent or unusual in nature 

excluding the items noted above and as shown in the following table our consolidated net income for 2009 was 887 million or 245 per diluted share compared to 44 million or 012 per diluted share in 2008 

  

 

  

 

individual subsidiary results 

our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers alaska and horizon reported pretax income of 1838 million and 228 million respectively in 2009 financial and statistical data and an in depth discussion of the results of alaska and horizon are on the following pages for a reconciliation of these subsidiary results to the consolidated results of air group see note 13 in the consolidated financial statements

alaska airlines 

alaska reported income before income taxes of 1838 million in 2009 compared to a loss before income taxes of 1533 million in 2008 

excluding certain items as noted in the table below alaska would have reported income before income taxes of 1459 million in 2009 compared to 252 million in 2008 see the previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 

 

  

the discussion below outlines significant variances between the two periods 

alaska revenues 

total operating revenues declined 2153 million or 67 during 2009 compared to 2008 the changes are summarized in the following table 

 

nm  not meaningful 

operating revenues – mainline 

mainline passenger revenue in 2009 fell by 78 on a 44 reduction in capacity there was a 35 decline in prasm which was driven by a 60 drop in ticket yield compared to 2008 partially offset by a twopoint increase in load factor 

passenger revenues were also bolstered by the implementation of our firstcheckedbag fee in the third quarter of 2009 345 million and the fullyear impact of our secondcheckedbag fee implemented in the third quarter of 2008 partially offset by a decline in other fees that resulted from fewer passengers 

freight and mail revenue decreased 78 million or 79 primarily as a result of lower mail volumes and yield and lower freight fuel surcharges because of the decline in fuel prices in 2009 partially offset by higher freight volumes and better freight pricing 

othernet revenue increased 521 million or 385 from 2008 mileage plan revenue increased by 500 million primarily because of an increase in the rate paid to us by our credit card partner under the affinity card agreement and an increase in the number of miles needed to redeem a travel award this change reduces our estimate of the fair value of a mile and results in a lower amount deferred as a liability for future travel and increases the amount of commission revenue we record when miles are sold 

passenger revenue– purchased capacity 

passenger revenuepurchased capacity flying fell by 124 million over the same period of last year because of a 26 decline in capacity combined with a 16 decrease in unit revenue compared to the prior year unit revenue dropped as a result of a 13point decline in load factor on flat ticket yield 

alaska expenses 

for 2009 total operating expenses decreased 5730 million or 171 compared to 2008 as a result of lower mainline operating costs most notably aircraft fuel and fleet transition charges partially offset by higher wages and benefits and new pilot contract transition costs 

we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 

 

 27  

mainline operating expenses 

total mainline operating expenses declined 5408 million or 178 during 2009 compared to the prior year significant operating expense variances from 2008 are more fully described below 

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits were up 499 million or 67 compared to 2008 the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table 

 

wages declined 12 on a 74 reduction in ftes compared to 2008 wages have not declined in step with the fte reduction because of higher wage rates for the pilot group in connection with their new contract and increased average wages for certain other employees stemming from higher average seniority 

the 671 increase in pension and other retirementrelated benefits is primarily due to a 450 million increase in our definedbenefit pension cost driven by the significant decline in the market value of pension assets at the end of 2008 

medical benefits increased 152 from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the postretirement medical expense for the pilot group in connection with their new contract and an increase in overall medical costs 

we expect wages and benefits to decline in 2010 as compared to 2009 because of a significant decline in our definedbenefit pension cost and productivity and overhead reduction initiatives that should reduce the average number of fulltime equivalent employees these declines will likely be partially offset by increased pilot wage rates stemming from the full year impact of the 2009 contract normal step and scale wage increases in other represented employee groups and higher employee and retiree medical costs 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased from 158 million in 2008 to 616 million in 2009 the increase is partially due to the fact that in 2009 our financial and operational results exceeded targets established by our board in 2008 our performance fell short of targets the increase can also be attributed to the addition of pilots flight attendants and mechanics to the pbp incentive plan 

over the long term our plan is designed to pay at target although we may or may not meet those targets in any single year at target we estimate the pbp expense would be 30 million and aggregate incentive pay for all plans would be approximately 40 million to 45 million for 2010 which would be lower than in 2009 

aircraft fuel 

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

aircraft fuel expense declined 6134 million or 528 compared to 2008 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

 

 

 

 

fuel gallons consumed declined 87 primarily as a result of a 66 reduction in aircraft flight hours and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the transition to newer more fuelefficient b737800 aircraft in the second half of 2008 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon declined 432 as a result of lower west coast jet fuel prices driven by lower crude oil costs and refining margins

we also evaluate economic fuel expense which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period offset by the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

 

 

 

  

as noted above the total net expense recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 504 million in 2009 compared to a net cash benefit of 1018 million in 2008 these amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement the decrease is primarily due to the significant drop in crude oil prices over the past year 

we currently expect our raw and economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately 224 in the first quarter of 2010 as oil prices are volatile we are unable to forecast the full year cost with any certainty 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance increased by 193 million or 128 compared to the prior year primarily because of a higher average cost of airframe maintenance events and a new powerbythehour pbh maintenance agreement on our b737700 and b737900 aircraft engines partially offset by the benefits of our fleet transition as we have replaced all of our aging md80s with newer b737800s and lower pbh costs associated with our 747400 aircraft engines that resulted from a decline in flight hours 

we expect aircraft maintenance to be relatively flat in 2010 

contracted services 

contracted services declined by 113 million or 87 compared to 2008 as a result of the reduction in the number of flights operated throughout our system to ports where vendors are used and a reduction in project contract labor 

we expect contracted services to increase in 2010 as we provide a full year of service to some of our new destinations requiring vendor support 

selling expenses 

selling expenses declined by 113 million or 97 compared to 2008 as a result of lower revenuerelated expenses such as credit card costs travel agency commissions and ticket distribution costs that resulted from the decline in passenger traffic mileage plan expenses were also lower because the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel was lower because of the decline in fuel costs these declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs 

we expect selling expenses will be slightly higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to higher revenuerelated expenses 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 126 million or 76 compared to 2008 this is primarily due to the ten b737800 aircraft delivered in 2009 partially offset by the saleleaseback of six b737800 aircraft in the first quarter of 2009 

we expect depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2010 due to the fullyear impact of aircraft that were delivered in 2009 and are expected to be delivered in 2010 

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses declined 91 million or 53 compared to the prior year the decline is primarily driven by a reduction in outside professional services costs and flight crewrelated costs such as hotels and perdiems 

new pilot contract transition costs 

as mentioned previously we recorded 358 million in connection with the new fouryear contract ratified by alaska’s pilots in the second quarter 

restructuring charges and fleet transition costs 

in the third quarter of 2008 we announced work force reductions among union and nonunion employees the affected nonunion employees were terminated in the third quarter resulting in a 16 million severance charge for union personnel we recorded an 113 million charge in 2008 

 29  

during 2008 we retired four md80 aircraft that were under longterm lease arrangements and placed them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility the 475 million charge in 2008 represented the remaining discounted lease payments under the lease contracts and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the minimum return conditions under the lease requirements 

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 

 

 

 

casm excluding fuel and noted items increased from the prioryear period because of the increase in wages and benefits and other expenses as discussed above partially offset by a 44 reduction in capacity 

we have listed separately in the above table our fuel costs new pilot contract transition costs fleet transition charges and restructuring charges per asm and our unit cost excluding these items these amounts are included in casm but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our costreduction progress we believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 30  

we currently forecast our mainline costs per asm excluding fuel and other special items for the first quarter and full year of 2010 to be flat and down 3 respectively compared to 2009 the expected decline in unit cost stems from lower pension costs and lower projected incentive payments offset by modest increases in other expense areas historical cost per asm excluding fuel and other special items can be found in item 6 “selected consolidated financial and operating data”

  

purchased capacity costs 

purchased capacity costs decreased 322 million compared to 2008 of the total 2617 million was paid to horizon under the cpa for 14 billion asms this expense is eliminated in consolidation 

 31  

horizon air financial and statistical data 

 

 

nm  not meaningful

 

 32  

horizon air 

horizon reported income before income taxes of 228 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 558 million in 2008 the improvement is primarily due to declines in aircraft fuel costs and nonfuel operating expenses partially offset by a 795 million decline in operating revenues 

excluding the items noted in the table below horizon would have reported income before income taxes of 77 million in 2009 compared to a loss before income taxes of 104 million in 2008 see the previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 

 

  

horizon revenues 

during 2009 operating revenues decreased 108 compared to 2008 horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below in the cpa horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity as a result yield and load factor information for the cpa arrangement are not presented 

  

 

 

 

passenger revenue from horizon brand flying fell 473 million or 110 on a 132 reduction in brand capacity partially offset by a 28 improvement in unit revenue the increase in unit revenue is due to the slight improvements in both load factor and ticket yield 

  

revenue from cpa flying performed on behalf of alaska totaled 2617 million during 2009 compared to 2937 million during 2008 the decrease is primarily due to a 22 reduction in capacity provided under this arrangement and a significant decline in the associated fuel cost which is reimbursed by alaska this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 

horizon expenses 

total operating expenses decreased 1611 million or 208 as compared to 2008 the sharp decline in fuel costs was the primary driver of the overall decrease significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

 

 33  

wages and benefits 

wages and benefits declined 89 million or 46 compared to 2008 the primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table   

 

 

wages declined 7 primarily as a result of a 106 decline in the number of fulltime equivalent employees partially offset by slightly higher wages per employee the increase in average wages per employee is due to a higher average employee seniority level as recent furloughs have involved less senior employees 

we expect wages and benefits will be lower in 2010 than in 2009 due to fewer ftes as we see the fullyear impact of 2009 furloughs and transitions of employees to alaska as part of the shared services effort we also have a number of productivity enhancement goals for 2010 

variable incentive pay 

variable incentive pay expense increased to 144 million during 2009 from 56 million in 2008 of which 86 million and 1 million was related to pbp in 2009 and 2008 respectively variable pay increased for the same performance reasons cited in the alaska discussion and the addition of horizon’s flight attendants and nonrepresented employees into air group’s pbp plan 

if we achieve targets set by the board and assuming no change in the participating employee groups pbp expense in 2010 will be approximately 5 million and aggregate incentive pay for all plans will be approximately 10 million compared to 144 million in 2009 

aircraft fuel 

 

aircraft fuel declined 1269 million or 538 compared to the same period in 2008 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

 

 

 

 

the 102 reduction in gallons consumed is primarily a function of the capacity reductions in 2009 compared to the prior year 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon declined by 435 as a result of the drop in crude oil prices and refining margins 

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

 

 

 

  

the total net expense recognized for hedges that settled during the period was 103 million in 2009 compared to a net cash benefit of 209 million in 2008 these amounts represent the net of the premium expense recognized for those hedges and any cash received or paid upon settlement 

we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon will be about 229 in the first quarter of 2010 

aircraft maintenance 

aircraft maintenance expense decreased 50 million or 86 primarily as a result of fewer scheduled maintenance events and cost savings from process improvement initiatives 

we expect maintenance costs will increase in 2010 primarily due to the timing of maintenance events we are working on certain initiatives designed to mitigate these increases over the longterm while maintaining our focus on a safe compliant and reliable operation 

aircraft rent 

aircraft rent expense declined 122 million or 214 as a result of the complete transition out of the q200 fleet all of which were leased and the sublease of two crj700 aircraft in late 2008 

we expect aircraft rent will be flat in 2010 as compared to 2009 unless we are able to remarket crj aircraft 

selling expenses 

selling expenses declined 40 million or 129 compared to the prior year as a result of lower credit card and travel agency commissions and lower ticket distribution costs due to the decline in passenger traffic 

we expect selling expenses to be flat in 2010 compared to 2009 on our expectation of flat capacity for the year 

 34  

other operating expenses 

other operating expenses declined 33 million or 77 compared to 2008 the decline is primarily driven by a reduction in nonwage passenger remuneration costs and flight crewrelated costs such as hotels and perdiems 

fleet transition costs 

fleet transition costs associated with the removal of q200 aircraft from the operating fleet were 88 million during 2009 compared to 102 million in 2008 all q200 aircraft have been removed from the operating fleet should we decide to restructure the sublease for the 16 q200 currently subleased to a thirdparty carrier we will likely have future charges associated with any transaction at this time we are unable to estimate the timing or the amount of any future charges 

during 2008 as a result of our decision to retire the crj700 fleet earlier than expected we recorded a 55 million impairment charge associated with the two owned crj700 aircraft and related spare parts 67 million associated with a net loss on the sublease arrangement for two leased crj700 aircraft and a 13 million severance charge associated with the fleet reduction 

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below   

 

 

 

 

we currently forecast our costs per asm excluding fuel and other special items for the first quarter and full year of 2010 to be down 1 and 3 respectively compared to 2009 historical cost per asm excluding fuel and other special items can be found in item 6 “selected consolidated financial and operating data” 

conso lidated nonoperating income expense 

net nonoperating expense was 645 million in 2009 compared to 410 million in 2008 interest income declined 98 million compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns partially offset by a higher average balance of cash and marketable securities interest expense declined 18 million on lower average interest rates on our variablerate debt on a relatively stable average debt balance capitalized interest was 156 million lower than in 2008 because of lower advance aircraft purchase deposits and the deferred future aircraft deliveries 

consolida ted income tax expense benefit 

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income or loss for 2009 was 401 compared to 363 for 2008 the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 378 is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards 

our effective tax rate can vary significantly between quarters and for the full year depending on the magnitude of nondeductible expenses in proportion to pretax results 

2008 compared with 2007 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2008 was 1359 million or 374 per share compared to net income of 1243 million or 307 per diluted share in 2007 both periods include gains and losses arising from fuelhedging activities in 2008 there were several other items as noted below that affect the comparability between the two years 

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 35  

as shown in the table below excluding these items our consolidated net income for 2008 was 44 million or 012 per diluted share compared to 916 million or 226 per diluted share in 2007 see previous discussion under “adjusted nongaap earnings and pershare amounts” for additional information about these nongaap measures 

  

 

  

  

alas ka airlines 

  

alaska reported a loss before income taxes of 1533 million during 2008 compared to income before income taxes of 2150 million in 2007 the 3683 million difference between the periods is primarily due to the 4249 million increase in aircraft fuel expense including hedging gains and losses compared to the prior period 475 million of fleet transition costs and 129 million of restructuring charges partially offset by a 1514 million increase in operating revenues 

alaska revenues 

  

total operating revenues increased 1514 million or 49 in 2008 as compared to 2007 the components of alaska’s revenue are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

 

operating revenue—mainline 

 

mainline passenger revenue increased 38 on flat capacity and a 37 increase in passenger revenues per available seat mile prasm the increase in mainline prasm was the result of a 23 increase in yields and a 11point increase in load factor compared to the prioryear period an increase in mileage plan redemption revenue and higher ancillary fee revenue contributed significantly to the increase in yields compared to 2007 

freight and mail revenues increased 51 million or 54 over 2007 the increase is due to increased yields for freight and mail and freight fuel surcharges partially offset by a decline in freight volumes compared to the prior year 

  

other—net revenues declined 119 million or 81 primarily as a result of lower commission revenue on the sale of mileage plan miles to our nonairline partners 

change in mileage plan terms 

  

beginning in august 2008 we reduced the length of time that a mileage plan account could be inactive from three years to two years before the account is deleted as a result of this change in terms our mileage plan liability was reduced by 423 million this benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as “change in mileage plan terms” 

 36  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity increased by 194 million over the same period in 2007 because of a 57 increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity unit revenues increased due to a 68 increase in yields offset by a 07point decline in load factors compared to 2007 

alaska expenses 

  

for the year total operating expenses increased 4941 million or 173 compared to 2007 as a result of higher mainline operating costs most notably aircraft fuel expense including hedging gains and losses fleet transition charges and restructuring charges we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 

  

 

  

mainline operating expenses 

  

significant mainline operating expense variances are described below 

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits decreased during the full year of 2008 by 112 million or 15 primarily as a result of lower definedbenefit pension costs reduced overtime and a 05 decrease in fulltime equivalent employees compared to 2007 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay for 2008 increased 23 million or 170 compared to 2007 the increase is primarily due to higher payouts under our operational performance reward program offset by lower overall payouts in our profitsharing plans due to the decline in profitability from 2007 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 4249 million or 576 compared to 2007 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

 

 

 

fuel gallons consumed decreased 58 due to the decrease in capacity and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the fleet transition out of the lessefficient md80 aircraft to newer moreefficient b737800 aircraft on relatively flat capacity for the year because the b737800 aircraft are larger than the md80s the flat capacity came on a 26 decline in revenue block hours 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 421 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs for much of the year 

during 2008 we recorded significant marktomarket losses reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel prices declined sharply late in the year during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

 

 

 

 37  

the total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008 excluding hedges that were terminated early increased by 569 million to 1018 million compared to 2007 this increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices during 2008 

  

as part of our effort to restructure our fuelhedge portfolio in 2008 we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions having lower average strike prices as a result we realized losses of approximately 415 million representing the difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent declined by 66 million or 59 during 2008 because of the retirement of all remaining leased md80 aircraft offset by one additional leased b737800 aircraft since 2007 

  

landing fees and other rents 

  

landing fees and other rents declined by 24 million or 14 compared to 2007 the decline is primarily attributable to the decline in departures resulting in lower landing fees across the system 

contracted services 

  

during 2008 contracted services increased by 61 million or 49 compared to 2007 this is primarily due to efforts to improve our operational performance and the introduction of new stations in our route system where we contract airport services 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses declined 133 million or 103 compared to 2007 the decline is driven by lower ticket distribution fees and lower expenses associated with our mileage plan program 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 236 million or 166 compared to 2007 as a result of the delivery of 11 b737800 aircraft in 2008 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses increased primarily because of higher personnel and crew costs property taxes and legal fees partially offset by a decline in passenger remuneration costs stemming from our improved operational performance 

  

restructuring charges and fleet transition costs 

  

in the third quarter of 2008 we announced reductions in work force among union and nonunion employees resulting in a 129 million charge associated with severance payments and continued medical coverage 

  

during 2008 we retired four md80 aircraft that were under longterm lease arrangements and placed them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility the 475 million charge in the period represented the remaining lease payments under the lease contract at that time and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the minimum return conditions under the lease requirements 

  

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 

 

 

 

 

purchased capacity costs 

  

purchased capacity costs increased 109 million to 3137 million during 2008 compared to 3028 million in 2007 of the total 2937 million was paid to horizon under the capacity purchase arrangement cpa for 14 billion asms this expense is eliminated in consolidation 

 38  

horizo n air 

  

horizon reported a loss before income taxes of 558 million during 2008 compared to 107 million in 2007 the 451 million decline in profitability is primarily due to higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs partially offset by lower nonfuel operating costs and higher operating revenues 

horizon revenues 

  

in 2008 operating revenues increased 155 million or 22 compared to 2007 horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the following table 

 

 

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below in the cpas horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity as a result yield and load factor information for the cpa arrangements are not presented 

  

 

 

 

  

systemwide horizon’s operating unit revenues increased 124 compared to 2007 however the increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of frontier jetexpress flying which produced relatively low rasm because of the nature of the contract to higher rasm brand and alaska cpa flying the frontier jetexpress operation ceased in november 2007 

horizon brand flying includes routes in the horizon system not covered by the alaska cpa horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets passenger revenue from horizon brand flying increased 379 million or 97 on a 65 increase in brand capacity and a 32 increase in unit revenues the increase in unit revenues was due to a 41 increase in yields in those markets partially offset by a 07point decline in load factor 

revenue from the cpa with alaska totaled 2937 million during 2008 compared to 2834 million in 2007 the increase is primarily driven by the 27 increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 

horizon expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 557 million or 77 as compared to 2007 significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are described below 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits decreased 72 million or 36 primarily as a result of a 51 decrease in ftes 

 39  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 972 million or 700 compared to 2007 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

 

 

 

  

the 32 increase in consumption was driven by the elimination of frontier jetexpress flying in 2007 as those aircraft were redeployed into the horizon fleet horizon began purchasing the fuel whereas under the jetexpress arrangement fuel was purchased by frontier offsetting these increases in fuel consumption was the decline in system capacity which led to lower fuel consumption additionally we have had improved fuel efficiency of our fleet resulting from new q400 aircraft deliveries as they replaced outgoing q200 aircraft 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 394 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher average crude oil costs and refinery margins 

  

as at alaska we recorded significant marktomarket losses in 2008 reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel prices declined sharply throughout the year during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows   

 

 

 

 

  

the total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008 excluding hedges that were terminated early increased by 124 million to 209 million compared to 2007 this increase was primarily due to the recordhigh crude oil prices during the year 

  

like alaska as part of the effort to restructure our fuelhedge portfolio we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions with lower average strike prices as a result we realized losses of approximately 85 million representing the difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts 

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense decreased 338 million or 367 primarily as a result of fewer maintenance events and cost savings from process improvements 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent decreased 87 million or 133 from 2007 due to the lease termination of a number of q200 aircraft along with the sublease of additional q200 aircraft and two crj700 aircraft to third parties 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 36 million or 106 as a result of the two new q400s that were delivered in 2008 and the fullyear depreciation on 13 q400s delivered in 2007 we own all of these new aircraft 

fleet transition costs 

  

fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of q200 aircraft were 87 million during 2008 compared to 141 million in 2007 all 16 of the q200 aircraft under the existing sublease arrangement have been delivered we also recorded a 15 million charge associated with six additional q200s that were removed from operating service in 2008 and returned to the lessor 

  

as noted earlier we recorded a 135 million charge in 2008 associated with the decision to retire the crj700 fleet earlier than expected 

 

 40  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 

  

 

 

 

  

c onsol idated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 410 million in 2008 compared to 104 million in 2007 interest income declined by 115 million compared to 2007 primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns partially offset by a higher average cash and marketable securities balance interest expense increased 143 million because of new debt arrangements in 2007 and 2008 partially offset by lower interest rates on our variablerate debt capitalized interest declined 46 million from 2007 resulting from a decrease in predelivery deposits in connection with our orders for b737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft

consolid ated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on income loss before income taxes for 2008 was 363 compared to an effective income tax rate of 380 in 2007 the effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by 21 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in note 11 excluding this benefit our effective tax rate would have been 390 the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate in 2008 of approximately 375 is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards 

critic al accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 

critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our many travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel 

for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue when the cash is received the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2009 we had approximately 116 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 6917 million both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles 

  

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as fare levels change our deferral rate changes resulting in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter because of the change in our award structure in 2008 whereby more miles are required to redeem an award the estimated fair value of each mile sold is lower this results in a lower amount deferred for future travel and a higher amount recorded as commission income currently 

 41  

 

  

members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel therefore based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts we estimate how many miles will never be used “breakage” and reduce the liability associated with those miles our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members’ accounts account balances and other factors we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations a hypothetical 10 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 72 million effect on the liability actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates 

  

3 the number of miles used per award ie free ticket 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska horizon or other airlines 

  

 

  

the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

  

 

  

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on alaska or horizon incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we regularly review significant mileage plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

pension plans 

  

accounting rules require recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 930 million 480 million and 626 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we expect the 2010 expense to be approximately 51 million which is significantly lower than the amount recognized in 2009 the decline is primarily due to the improvement in the market values of the pension assets in 2009 nearly 150 million of funding in 2009 and the movement of disability retirement from the pilot pension plan to a separate longterm disability plan 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2009 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 775 this rate was developed using historical data the current value of the underlying assets as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2009 is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixedincome securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 775 to 725 would increase our estimated 2010 pension expense by approximately 45 million 

 42  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 585 and 620 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the discount rate at december 31 2009 was determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 585 to 535 would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2009 by approximately 891 million and increase estimated 2010 pension expense by approximately 83 million 

  

all of our definedbenefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants with the ratification of the new alaska pilot collective bargaining agreement in 2009 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 32 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

in 2007 horizon announced plans to phase out its remaining leased q200 aircraft all of these aircraft were leased under operating lease agreements as a result of this decision we reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the related rotable and repairable q200 parts and as such have depreciated these parts down to their estimated salvage value we are in the process of disposing of these parts 

  

in 2008 horizon announced plans to ultimately exit its crj700 fleet and transition to an allq400 fleet dependent on the ability to remarket the crj700 aircraft as a result of the decision we determined that the two owned crj700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of 55 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value we have reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the two owned aircraft and the related spare parts and are depreciating those assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 

  

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft 

  

prospec tive accounting pronouncements 

  

new accounting standards on “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” were issued in september 2009 and update the current guidance pertaining to multipleelement revenue arrangements this new guidance will be effective for our annual reporting period beginning january 1 2011 we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on our financial position results of operations cash flows and disclosures 

liquidi ty and capital resources 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are 

  

 

  

 

  

• our 185 million bank lineofcredit facility 

  

 

  

 

because of the severe economic uncertainty in the early part of 2009 and the volatility of fuel prices in recent years we intentionally increased our balance of cash and marketable securities to current levels as the economic climate stabilizes we will likely seek to reduce our cash and marketable securities to 25 to 30 of revenues over the next 24 months either through debt repayment further share repurchases or pension funding we will continue to focus on preserving a strong liquidity position and evaluate our cash needs as conditions change 

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance of 12 billion combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months and would continue to be sufficient if we reduce our cash balance as described above 

 43  

in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in us government securities assetbacked obligations and corporate debt securities we do not invest in equities or auctionrate securities as of december 31 2009 we had a 140 million net unrealized gain on our 12 billion cash and marketable securities balance 

our overall investment strategy for our marketable securities portfolio has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

  

 

 

the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements 

analy sis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 3053 million compared to 1643 million during 2008 the 1410 million increase was primarily driven by the significant decline in fuel costs compared to the prior year partially offset by lower revenues and a supplementary 100 million contribution to our pension plans in december 2009 

we typically generate positive cash flows from operations but historically have consumed substantially all of that cash plus additional debt proceeds for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2010 however we anticipate much lower capital expenditures than in the past few years and may choose to use our operating cash flow to pay down debt provide more funding to our pension plans repurchase our common stock or a combination thereof 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures associated with our fleet transitions and to a lesser extent purchases and sales of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 6574 million during 2009 compared to 5813 million in 2008 our capital expenditures increased by 256 million as a result of the purchase of ten b737800s and five q400s in 2009 versus the purchase of 11 b737800s and two q400s in 2008 

  

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 207 million of which 122 million is expected to be aircraftrelated during 2010 as we take delivery of four new b737800s and begin work on an airport terminal move at los angeles international airport 

cash provided by financing activities 

  

we finance a large portion of our capital spending with debt financing net cash provided by financing activities was 2332 million during 2009 compared to 4958 million during 2008 we completed saleleaseback transactions on six b737800 aircraft for net proceeds of 230 million and we received debt proceeds of 104 million from our predelivery payment facility and 2646 million for five new q400 aircraft and six new b737800 aircraft offsetting these proceeds were longterm debt payments of 1357 million 503 million of payments on our predelivery payment facility and a 75 million payment on our bank lineofcredit facility additionally we repurchased 238 million of our common stock in 2009 compared to a 489 million repurchase in 2008 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing if necessary 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

alaska has a 185 million variablerate credit facility that expires in march 2010 the facility has a requirement for us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of 500 million there is no outstanding balance on this facility at december 31 2009 we are working to renew this facility and believe we can do so at terms that will be acceptable to us see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

predelivery payment facility 

  

alaska’s 80 million variablerate revolving loan facility expiring in august 2011 is available to provide a portion of the predelivery funding requirements of alaska’s purchase of boeing 737800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement as of december 31 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 44  

contra ctual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

in april 2009 alaska entered into an agreement with boeing to defer the delivery of a number of b737800 aircraft and agreed to purchase an additional four aircraft to be delivered in 2014 and 2015 in july 2009 horizon entered into an agreement with bombardier to defer all remaining 2010 and 2011 q400 deliveries to 2012 and 2013 

given the revised delivery schedules noted above at december 31 2009 we had firm orders to purchase 23 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately 5888 million as set forth below alaska has options to acquire 40 additional b737s and horizon has options to acquire 10 q400s 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

 

we expect to pay for the four b737800 aircraft deliveries in 2010 with cash on hand we expect to pay for firm orders beyond 2010 and the option aircraft if exercised through internally generated cash longterm debt or operating lease arrangements  

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2009 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pension obligations 

  

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans which could be approximately 45 million to 75 million per year based on our historical funding practice although there is no minimum required contribution in 2010 with the recent volatility in market values the fair value of plan assets has fluctuated significantly in the past two years in 2009 our plan assets recovered some of the value lost with the market declines in 2008 as a result of the partial value recovery and a supplemental 100 million contribution to the plan in december 2009 the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans was 2729 million at december 31 2009 compared to 4449 million at december 31 2008 this results in a 769 funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 594 funded as of december 31 2008 

  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement under another such agreement we would be obligated to maintain a reserve if our cash balance fell below 350 million we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

effec t of inflation and price changes 

  

inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income 

return on invested capital 

  

we strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business our target return on invested capital roic is 10 we have not historically reached this threshold nor did we in the periods presented in this report however our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers

 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend 

  

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases and interestrate increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

mark et risk – aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists of crude oil call options and jet fuel refining margin swap contracts we utilize the contracts in our portfolio as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of fuel prices allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing fuel prices with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2009 would increase or decrease the fair value of our crude oil hedge portfolio by approximately 406 million and 356 million respectively 

our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth 1159 million at december 31 2009 for which we have paid 889 million of premiums to counterparties compared to a portfolio value of 283 million at december 31 2008 we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2009 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

f inan cial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2009 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 11 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements over the past several years our variablerate debt is approximately 22 of our total longterm debt at december 31 2009 compared to 21 at december 31 2008 

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2009 interest income would increase by approximately 114 million

chang es in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes to the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation during the year ended december 31 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

man agement’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso framework based on our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 

  

we intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our controls and procedures 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 which report appears on page 77

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

 

 

  

we have audited alaska air group inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso alaska air group inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion alaska air group inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of alaska air group inc as of december 31 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2009 and our report dated february 18 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

our airlines 

  

alaska 

  

alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to hawaii and nine cities in the continental us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from anchorage los angeles and portland oregon during 2008 we initiated service to maui with nonstops from seattle and anchorage to the big island of hawaii with nonstops from seattle and nonstop service from seattle to minneapolis we also recently announced nonstop service from seattle to austin tx and portland to maui both beginning in august 2009 

  

in 2008 we carried 168 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations and in each year since 1973 we have carried more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the 

  

   

number of passengers alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2008 revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlesan diego at december 31 2008 alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 110 jet aircraft compared to 115 aircraft as of december 31 2007 

  

alaska’s passenger traffic by market is presented below 

  

   

horizon 

  

horizon air industries a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves a number of cities in seven states five cities in canada and two cities in mexico horizon initiated service to loreto and la paz mexico from los angeles in 2008 additionally horizon launched service to prescott and flagstaff arizona and mammoth lakes california in 2008 

  

in 2008 horizon carried 74 million revenue passengers approximately 91 of horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2008 were flown domestically primarily in the states of washington oregon idaho and california compared to 92 in 2007 the canada markets accounted for 8 of revenue passenger miles in both 2008 and 2007 flying to mexico in 2008 accounted for less than 1 of total revenue passenger miles based on passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland boise and spokane based on revenues in 2008 the leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and boiseseattle at december 31 2008 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 18 jets and 41 turboprop aircraft horizon flights are listed under the alaska airlines designator code in airline reservation systems 

  

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient competitive connections between most points served by their systems in 2008 and 2007 approximately 23 and 22 respectively of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska 

  

industry conditions 

  

2008 proved to be an extremely challenging year for the airline industry we faced record high fuel prices that resulted in liquidation of several airlines and threatened the viability of others ancillary fees were added by most carriers to help offset the rising price of fuel the last half of the year saw significant declines in the price of oil but that soon became overshadowed by the economic recession in the us and abroad as a result the industry is sharply reducing capacity to help offset the declining demand alaska and horizon plan to reduce capacity in 2009 by 8 and 9 respectively 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and has historically been characterized by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity 

  

 fuel 

  

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel prices have been extremely volatile over the past few years the price of crude oil rose from just under 90 per barrel in january 2008 up to nearly 150 per barrel in july 2008 subsequent to its record high oil prices began to drop sharply in the last half of 2008 and ended the year around 40 per barrel for us a 1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to approximately 9 million of additional fuel cost annually 

  

we refer to the price we pay at the airport or “intoplane” price including applicable taxes as our “raw” fuel price raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and substantially more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting both alaska and horizon at a competitive disadvantage historically fuel costs have generally represented 10 to 15 of an airline’s operating costs however in recent years because of the rise in prices fuel expense represents 30 to 40 of total operating costs for airlines both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results even with the sharp decline in prices in the last half of 2008 our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 42 in 2008 and 8 and 17 in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

  

we use crude oil call options almost exclusively as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for a percentage of our planned fuel consumption with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts we also use collar structures in limited instances for fuel hedging purposes additionally we enter into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay on a certain percentage of our fuel consumption 

  

fuel costs including gains and losses stemming from changes in the value of our hedge portfolio were approximately 36 of our total operating expenses in 2008 27 in 2007 and 26 in 2006 for 2009 a onecent change in our hedged fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 35 million in addition to our hedging program we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices at alaska we have completed our fleet transition out of the md80 aircraft to more fuelefficient b737800 aircraft and at horizon we are currently transitioning to an allq400 turboprop fleet alaska also retrofitted its b737900 fleet with winglets in 2008 as a result the fuel burn expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon asmsg improved over the past two years from 659 asmsg in 2006 to 695 asmsg in 2008 this reduction has not only reduced our fuel cost but 

  

   

also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that we emit 

  

although we do not anticipate a significant reduction in jet fuel availability because of the decline in global demand dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oilproducing areas there could be reductions in the production andor importation of crude oil resulting in price increases which could adversely affect our business if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel our business would be adversely affected 

  

marketing and competition 

  

alliances with other airlines 

  

we have marketing alliances with several other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as code sharing on certain flights as shown in the table below alliances enhance our revenues by 

  

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

  

our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2008 are as follows 

  

  

      

 competition 

  

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

together alaska and horizon carry approximately 32 of all us domestic passenger traffic we compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes including southwest airlines united airlines delta air lines including northwest continental airlines american airlines us airways jetblue airways virgin america and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers most of these airlines are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than our companies and some have lower operating costs in addition competitors that have successfully reorganized out of bankruptcy have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements some of these competitors have chosen to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation in many markets including train bus and automobile transportation 

  

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

   

our sales by channel are presented below 

  

   

   

employees 

  

labor costs have historically made up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements often airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition new entrants into the us airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines in 2008 we were able to reduce wages and benefits costs compared to 2007 primarily due to a decline in defined benefit pension costs and a decline in the number of fulltime equivalent employees ftes at both companies the reduction in ftes was driven by a reduction in work forces at both companies to coincide with planned capacity reductions and the improvement in operational performance at both companies that resulted in less overtime pay however we expect to see continued upward pressure on wages and benefits in the future due to normal step increases and increased benefits costs primarily pension and health care costs we recognize the need to continue to improve employee productivity in order to mitigate this cost pressure and to reduce our wages and benefits on an availableseatmile basis horizon has been successful in improving productivity when measured as number of passengers per fte with yearoveryear improvements in 25 of the last 28 quarters 

  

we had 14143 10250 at alaska and 3893 at horizon active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2008 compared to 14710 10526 at alaska and 4184 at horizon as of december 31 2007 wages salaries and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 40 and 41 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

at december 31 2008 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 49 of horizon’s employees our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to appoint a federal mediator if no agreement is reached in mediation the national mediation board may declare that an impasse exists at which point the national mediation board offers binding arbitration to the parties either party may decline to submit to arbitration if either party rejects arbitration a 30day “coolingoff” period commences during that period a presidential emergency board may be established which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution the presidential emergency board process if invoked lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “coolingoff” period of 30 days at the end of the applicable “coolingoff” period unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “selfhelp” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments on the collective bargaining agreements andor the hiring of workers to replace strikers 

  

 alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2008 were as follows 

  

  

   

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2008 were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the department of transportation dot and the federal aviation administration faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

   

    

   

the aviation and transportation security act the security act generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures pursuant to the security act the transportation security administration tsa is responsible for aviation security the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of passengers and property including us mail cargo carryon and checked baggage and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft the tsa performs most of these functions with its own federal employees the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights the security act imposes a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures in addition carriers are required to pay an additional amount to the tsa to cover the cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 we paid 126 million each year to the tsa for this security charge in 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  

airline fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the dot maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve although air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts given to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and 

other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the 

  

   

resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements we maintain our own continuing safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

  

the current federal administration will likely move forward in 2009 or 2010 with legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions we believe legislation will most likely come in the form of a “cap and trade” system under which companies must purchase credits to emit above a specified cap we do not believe legislation is necessary to motivate airlines to reduce fuel burn and in turn reduce emissions for example alaska and horizon have transitioned or are transitioning to more fuelefficient singletype aircraft fleets thereby greatly reducing our total emissions 

  

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews the airport noise and capacity act generally requires faa approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

  

customer service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds in 2008 we set a goal of having all of our employees attend our customer experience workshop to enhance our customer service focus and ultimately improve the experience our customers have when traveling with us 

  

there has been some discussion of an “airline passenger’s bill of rights” at both the national and state levels bills have been introduced in several states including the state of washington that propose to regulate airlines when operating in those specific states however we believe these bills would be preempted by federal law we do not believe these bills are necessary and if the federal bills were to become law they could impose additional economic and resource constraints on our airlines and could negatively impact our financial performance 

  

mileage plan program 

  

all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner a grocery store chain a telephone company hotels car rental agencies and other businesses alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or to terminate the program 

  

 mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to capacitycontrolled seating beginning in the third quarter of 2008 mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after two years of inactivity in a member’s account prior to that date accounts were deleted after three years of inactivity as of december 31 2008 and 2007 alaska estimated that approximately 40 million and 37 million respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members of those eligible awards alaska estimated that approximately 88 would ultimately be redeemed for the years 2008 and 2007 approximately 936000 and 870000 roundtrip awards and 499000 and 270000 oneway flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon oneway awards were introduced in february 2007 for 2006 approximately 850000 roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 124 97 and 86 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for the years 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 214000 243200 and 252600 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners effective in november 2008 we began charging a 25 fee for awards redeemed on our airline partners 

  

for miles earned through travel on alaska or horizon and their airline partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards in the future is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost of providing award travel on alaska or horizon does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft ownership cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to its nonairline partners alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes revenue when award transportation is provided on alaska horizon or another partner airline at december 31 2008 and 2007 the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 6904 million and 6485 million respectively the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits excluding the 423 million benefit from the change in mileage plan account activity terms revenue attributable to the mileage plan was 2457 million 2276 million and 1942 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

tableend   

we have established an ongoing risk analysis and oversight program to identify and assign responsibility for the most significant risks facing our company the results of this program are routinely shared with our board of directors in this section we discuss the highest priority issues identified in our risk analysis if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline these risk factors may not be exhaustive we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

  

the current economic recession will impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

the current economic recession and outlook has resulted in a decline in demand for air travel our passenger count and traffic declined in the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year periods and we anticipate declines into 2009 we are reducing 2009 capacity at both alaska and horizon by 8 and 9 respectively when compared to 2008 to help offset this anticipated decline in passenger traffic which will likely result in a decline in operating revenues if demand declines further than expected it will harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints 

  

we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we had approximately 18 billion and 13 billion of 

  

 longterm debt outstanding respectively all of which is secured by flight equipment aircraft purchase rights and real property in addition to longterm debt we have significant other fixed obligations under operating leases related to our aircraft airport terminal space other airport facilities and office space as of december 31 2008 future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately 10 billion for 2009 through 2013 and an aggregate of approximately 400 million for the years thereafter 

  

at december 31 2008 we had firm orders to purchase 33 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of 7534 million through 2011 although we have secured financing for all of the firm q400 commitments there is no guarantee that additional financing will be available for our other aircraft deliveries when required or that the terms will be acceptable to us the current market conditions could result in a lack of availability or higher interest rates for financing of aircraft purchases which would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

   

   

   

we cannot ensure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements we cannot be certain now that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 

  

our failure to successfully reduce unit costs at both alaska and horizon could harm our business 

  

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to fund future growth and take advantage of market opportunities if economic conditions allow however with our planned capacity reductions we will see upward pressure on unit costs at least in the near term furthermore if horizon is unable to successfully transition to an allq400 fleet it will be more difficult to reach our unit cost goals as the remaining q200 and crj700 aircraft are more costly to operate on a perunit basis if we are unable to further reduce our nonfuel unit costs over the longterm and achieve targeted profitability we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future and therefore our financial results may suffer 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 36 and 27 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively significant increases in average fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations although prices have declined sharply over the past six months prices are still substantially higher than they were earlier in this decade future increases in the price of jet fuel will harm our financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares or add additional ancillary fees to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 

  

   

historically fuel costs and availability have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand it is often difficult to increase fares to offset increases in the price of fuel and although we had some success recently we may not be able to do so in the future 

  

we utilize fuel hedges as a form of insurance against the volatility of fuel prices to manage the risk of fuel price increases we primarily purchase call options that are designed to cap a portion of our fuel costs at designated perbarrel oil prices even with hedges we are substantially and increasingly exposed to increases in jet fuel costs as the average price at which we are hedged in future periods is higher than it has historically been 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the nature of competition in our markets changes 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares flight frequency frequent flyer benefits routes and service the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats over the past few years airlines have reduced domestic routes and the number of planes available which has resulted in reduced domestic industry capacity and a trend towards increased fares although capacity has declined based on a nationwide average capacity on the west coast has not declined to the same degree due to increased competition from new market entrants if airlines decide to increase their capacity in the future this could cause fares to decline which may adversely affect our business and results of operations many of our competitors are larger than we are and therefore may have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than we do in addition competitors who have successfully reorganized out of bankruptcy have lowered their operating costs as a result of renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements from time to time in the past some of these competitors have chosen to add service reduce their fares or take other competitive steps in our key markets we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 

  

the airline industry and particularly regional airlines like horizon also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives such as buses trains or automobiles increased use of technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools have also resulted in a change in business travel especially in shorthaul markets like those that horizon serves 

  

a significant increase in labor costs or change in key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 25 and 30 of our total operating expenses in 2008 and 2007 respectively as of december 31 2008 labor unions represented approximately 84 of alaska’s and 49 of horizon’s employees each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to many employees reduce employee engagement in our business and divert management’s attention from other projects and issues disengaged 

  

 employees could prevent us from achieving the operational improvements in completion rate and ontime performance that we seek 

  

in 2005 alaska and the air line pilots association alpa were unable to reach a new agreement and therefore pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that existed at the time the parties submitted the agreement to binding arbitration that arbitration decision which was effective may 1 2005 resulted in an average pilot wage reduction of 26 that contract became amendable on may 1 2007 and alaska has been in negotiations with alpa in 2008 alpa requested mediation from the national mediation board nmb in order to assist with contract negotiations we have begun meeting with the nmb and hope to reach a negotiated contract that recognizes the important contributions that our pilots make while not harming our competitive position horizon is also in negotiations with the international brotherhood of teamsters on a new pilot agreement the horizon pilot contract became amendable in september 2006 factoring in pay rates productivity measures and pension and postretirement medical benefits we believe our pilot unit costs at both alaska and horizon are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft we operate 

  

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace this is because most of our competitors either have eliminated such obligations through bankruptcy or have never had traditional pension plans in place currently all of our definedbenefit pension plans are closed to new entrants with the exception of the plan covering alaska’s pilots 

  

our definedbenefit pension plan assets are subject to market risk if market returns are poor in the future as they were in 2008 our obligation to make additional cash contributions in accordance with the pension plan act of 2006 could increase and harm our liquidity poor market returns also lead to higher pension expense in our statement of operations the calculation of pension expense is dependent on many assumptions that are more fully described in “critical accounting estimates” on page 52 and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

finally to the extent we are unable to maintain the outsourcing or subcontracting of certain services for our business we would incur substantial costs including costs associated with hiring new employees in order to perform these services inhouse 

  

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

delays and cancellations frustrate passengers reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs all of which affect our profitability due to our geographic area of operations we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors a general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub in 2008 passengers to and from seattle accounted for 62 of our total passengers 

  

   

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

  

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath negatively affected the airline industry including our company these attacks and other foiled terror plots since then have resulted in new security measures that also impacted our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

with respect to the availability of commercial war and allied perils insurance world events or events involving our company could result in sudden market volatility resulting in cancellation andor a material change in the availability or cost of the coverage which could adversely affect ongoing operations or results further commercial war and allied perils insurance now excludes certain catastrophic perils not previously excluded for weapons of mass destruction such as chemical biological or nuclear devices the commercial policies also contain low aggregate sublimits which do not adequately address potential catastrophic thirdparty war and allied perils exposures in the event we were to be required to rely on the commercial insurance market expensive excess limits would likely need to be explored in an equally volatile excess specialty market it remains therefore our position to retain our coverage for this aspect of the insurance program directly through the us government’s faa premium war risk insurance program rather than procure it from the commercial market 

  

although our insurance costs have declined significantly aviation insurers could increase their premiums again in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull and liability war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through march 31 2009 although the government may extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public in addition we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service although we strive to maintain the highest standards of safety and reliability should an accident or incident nevertheless occur we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

  

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure of these systems or by their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our computerized airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruption in changes to or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses and a possible temporary cessation of our operations 

  

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners” including but not limited to american airlines continental airlines delta air lines and northwest airlines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future in recent years alaska has subcontracted its heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

   

our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all although we believe that our vendor oversight and quality control is among the best in the industry if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

  

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many of its aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 

  

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us department of transportation the transportation security administration and the federal aviation administration the “faa” have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines for example the faa has issued regulations covering among other things security measures collision avoidance systems noise abatement environmental restrictions safety procedures and maintenance regulations similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our stock can be influenced by many factors a number of which are outside of our control including those discussed above some of the primary factors in the volatility of our stock price are

part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” discusses future orders and options for additional aircraft 

  

as of december 31 2008 59 of the 75 aircraft owned by alaska and three of the 22 aircraft owned by horizon are subject to liens securing longterm debt and the majority of the other owned alaska aircraft serve as collateral for our 185 million lineofcredit facility alaska’s leased 737400 737700 and 737800 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2009 and 2016 between 2009 and 2010 and between 2015 and 2018 respectively additionally alaska has four md80 aircraft under longterm lease arrangements through 2012 that are currently in temporary storage horizon’s leased q200 q400 and crj700 aircraft have expiration dates in 2012 in 2018 and between 2018 and 2020 respectively alaska and horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the thenfairmarket value of the aircraft 

  

alaska completed its transition to an allboeing fleet during 2008 horizon continues to progress in its plan to transition to an allq400 fleet as quickly and efficiently as possible depending on the ability to successfully market the crj700 aircraft 

  

giving consideration to these fleet transition plans and alaska’s plan to sell up to four b737700 aircraft in 2009 the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet counts for alaska and horizon as of the end of each quarter in 2009 the horizon fleet totals are fluid given the crj700 remarketing efforts and are likely to change 

  

  

   

   

ground facilities and services 

  

alaska and horizon lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve alaska also owns terminal buildings in various cities in the state of alaska 

  

alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near seattletacoma international airport seatac near seattle washington these include a fivebay hangar and shops complex used primarily for line maintenance a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an information technology office and mainframe computer facility an office building and corporate headquarters complex alaska also leases a stores warehouse and office spaces for a reservation facility and for various administrative functions in kent washington alaska’s major facilities outside of seattle include a regional headquarters building an air cargo facility and a hangaroffice facility in anchorage as well as leased reservations facilities in phoenix arizona and boise idaho alaska uses its own employees for ground handling services at most of our airports in the state of alaska at other airports throughout our system those services are contracted to various thirdparty vendors 

  

horizon owns its seattle corporate headquarters building it leases an operations training and aircraft maintenance facility in portland as well as line maintenance stations in boise spokane pasco los angeles and seattle

year in review 

  

in 2008 we reported a consolidated net loss of 1359 million compared to a consolidated net income of 1243 million in 2007 the largest driver of the decline in results was fuel expense our fuel expense increased by 5221 million over 2007 primarily as a result of the significantly higher average fuel prices in 2008 oil prices reached record levels during the summer months but declined sharply in the last few months of 2008 even with the benefit of 1227 million of net cash settlements from our fuel hedge program during the year our “economic” fuel cost as defined on page 39 increased 2776 million or 30 on a 44 decline in fuel gallons consumed this increase in fuel expense far exceeded the 1566 million increase in total operating revenues we also had the following notable items during 2008 

  

   

   

   

the revenue environment in 2008 was characterized by increased competition in our west coast market and softer demand in the last half of the year due to the current economic recession yield at both companies improved over 2007 as we and other carriers added or increased ancillary fees and raised fares to cover higher fuel costs alaska posted slightly higher passenger traffic for the full year and horizon posted a sharp decline in passenger traffic all of these factors along with a onetime 423 million benefit from changes in our mileage plan program resulted in an increase in total consolidated operating revenues of 1566 million 

  

   

our total operating expenses increased by 5397 million during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the significant increase in fuel costs along with an increase in fleet transition costs and restructuring charges this increase is offset by declines in nonfuel operating costs at both companies as we continued to make progress in our cost reduction efforts see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both alaska and horizon 

  

accomplishments and highlights 

  

accomplishments and highlights from 2008 include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

alaska fleet transition 

  

we completed our transition to an allb737 fleet in 2008 as our final md80 aircraft were removed from service during the year we now have one of the youngest most fuelefficient fleets in the industry 

  

we have four md80 aircraft under longterm lease arrangements that were retired prior to the end of their lease terms and placed in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility as a result of their grounding we recorded a 475 million charge during 2008 associated with these aircraft representing the remaining obligation under the existing lease contracts 

  

horizon fleet transition 

  

horizon is in the process of transitioning to an allq400 fleet and expects to complete the transition as soon as the crj700 fleet is successfully remarketed at the beginning of 2008 we had 17 q200s in the fleet of which we were able to remarket all but six through sublease agreements or arranged sales of the aircraft to third parties the total charge during 2008 related to the removal of these aircraft from operation was 102 million which represents the estimated sublease loss for five aircraft delivered under the sublease arrangement and the loss on the termination of the underlying leases of six additional aircraft although we removed all remaining q200 aircraft from scheduled operations as of the end of 2008 six of the aircraft were used as spares through the end of january 2009 we are actively remarketing these remaining aircraft we do not currently know the timing or amount of any associated charge 

  

in the first quarter of 2008 our board of directors approved the plan to remove our crj700 fleet from operations in addition to the q200 transition described above as a result of the decision the company determined that its two owned crj700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of 55 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value additionally during 2008 we recorded severance charges of 13 million 

  

 related to this fleet transition we are currently evaluating various alternatives to dispose of our crj700 aircraft in the most economically feasible way two of our 18 leased aircraft were subleased to a third party during the fourth quarter resulting in an estimated sublease loss of 67 million the current economic conditions are hindering the remarketing effort and could result in further delays of the timeline to transition completely to an allq400 fleet as such the nature timing or amount of any potential gain or loss associated with transactions on the remaining aircraft cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

  

fuel hedging 

  

we utilize primarily crude oil call options to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices although we do have some collar structures that are scheduled to settle in 2009 the total outstanding liability for the collar contracts at december 31 2008 is approximately 24 million and we currently do not have any collateral on deposit with counterparties to these agreements with call option contracts we benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no future cash exposure above the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we restructured our hedge portfolio to take advantage of lower fuel prices we were able to reduce our 2009 average strike price from 103 per barrel at the end of the third quarter of 2008 to 76 per barrel for 50 of the planned 2009 consumption as part of this restructuring effort we terminated some of the previously held contracts we realized losses on the termination of these contracts of 415 million and 85 million at alaska and horizon respectively representing the difference between the original premiums paid to purchase those contracts and the cash received from the counterparty upon termination we believe that restructuring the hedge portfolio was a wise use of our resources and consistent with our stated objective of managing volatility 

  

operational performance 

  

our core promise to our customers is to get them and their bags to their destinations safely and on time operational performance was a top initiative in 2008 and we believe we made significant progress during the year for 2008 alaska and horizon both exceeded their prioryear performance in ontime arrivals and in schedule completion rates as a result of the currentyear performance our employees received higher payouts under our operational performance rewards program 

  

fees and mileage plan changes 

  

like many of our competitors we have increased existing fees or implemented new fees in an effort to increase our revenues examples include 

  

   

   

   

   

the increases above were effective may 21 2008 we also began charging 25 for a second checked bag effective july 1 2008 first class and toptier mileage plan members and customers on flights within the state of alaska are exempt from the new fee 

  

on july 24 2008 we announced a 25 fee for booking mileage plan award travel on partner airlines we also announced that our domestic roundtrip “coach saver” award will increase to 25000 miles from 20000 miles and we have expanded our 15000mile “intraalaska” award levels in coach to an “intrastate” award this award offers travel wholly within one state for 15000 award miles other changes include an increase in the award miles needed for “peak” awards and the introduction of a threetier award level structure all of these changes are effective for awards redeemed on or after november 19 2008 

  

   

additionally beginning in august 2008 we reduced from three years to two years the length of time that a mileage plan account could be inactive before the account is deleted as a result of this change in terms our mileage plan liability was reduced by 423 million this benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as “change in mileage plan terms” 

  

update on labor negotiations 

  

alaska is currently in negotiations with its pilots and has been since early 2007 the contract with alaska’s pilots became amendable on may 1 2007 the air line pilots association alpa at alaska has requested mediation from the national mediation board nmb in order to assist with contract negotiations we have begun meeting with the nmb and hope to reach a negotiated contract that recognizes the important contributions that our pilots make while not harming our competitive position factoring in pay rates productivity measures pension and postretirement medical benefits we believe our pilot unit costs are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated 

  

alaska and the association of flight attendants have reached a tentative agreement to extend the current contract with alaska’s flight attendants by two years the current agreement becomes amendable on may 1 2010 horizon is currently in negotiations with the following work groups – pilots flight attendants technicians and dispatchers 

  

we do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be or when agreements will be reached however uncertainty around open contracts could distract some employees reduce employee engagement in our business and prevent us from achieving the operational goals such as ontime and completionrate targets that we have set 

  

common stock repurchase 

  

in september 2007 our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 100 million of our common stock over a twelvemonth period we completed the repurchase in february 2008 buying back 41 million shares of our outstanding common stock or 10 of the outstanding stock at the start of the program at an average price of 2431 per share during the first quarter of 2008 we repurchased 15 million shares for approximately 372 million on march 13 2008 we announced a new 50 million common stock repurchase program through april 24 2008 we had repurchased 605700 shares of our common stock for approximately 117 million under this new program the repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury shares in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 

  

we temporarily stopped further repurchases under this program given the uncertainty in the economic environment and currently do not expect to repurchase any more shares prior to the expiration date in march 2009 

  

line of credit modification 

  

alaska has a 185 million variablerate credit facility that expires in march 2010 in the fourth quarter we borrowed 75 million from this facility and that amount was outstanding at december 31 2008 on september 24 2008 we entered into the fourth amendment to our 185 million variablerate credit facility that eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of 500 million 

  

outlook 

  

as we look forward to 2009 the two primary uncertainties are the demand environment and fuel prices although fuel prices have declined significantly since their record high in july 2008 the global financial instability and economic recession have put downward pressure on demand for air travel 

  

traffic was down by 44 and 224 at alaska and horizon respectively in the fourth quarter as the economic recession began to take its toll on travel behaviors of our customers in anticipation of this decline in demand the alaska and horizon reduced capacity by 71 and 211 respectively in the fourth quarter we currently anticipate further capacity 

  

 reductions of 8 at alaska and 9 at horizon in 2009 compared with 2008 we believe the actions we are taking to reduce capacity are necessary and appropriate given the uncertainty in the demand outlook although we do have the flexibility to adjust our capacity throughout the year to stay aligned with demand 

  

oil prices have declined from a record 147 per barrel in july to approximately 40 to 45 per barrel recently that translates to a significant reduction in fuel cost for air group although prices are still above historical levels in july 2008 our average raw unhedged price of jet fuel per gallon was 419 and is currently around 160 per gallon oil prices continue to be volatile however and prices could rise again we continue to execute our hedging strategy to help remove some of the impact of that volatility on our financial results 

  

results of operations 

  

2008 compared with 2007 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2008 was 1359 million or 374 per share compared to net income of 1243 million or 307 per diluted share in 2007 both periods include gains and losses arising from fuelhedging activities in 2008 there were several other items as noted below that affect the comparability between the two years 

  

   

  

   

   

we believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because 

  

   

   

   

   

our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers alaska and horizon reported pretax losses of 1533 million and 558 million respectively in 2008 financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35 respectively an indepth discussion of the results of alaska and horizon begins on page 36 

  

   

alaska airlines financial and statistical data 

  

  

   

 horizon air financial and statistical data 

  

  

    

   

alaska airlines 

  

alaska reported a loss before income taxes of 1533 million during 2008 compared to income before income taxes of 2150 million in 2007 the 3683 million difference between the periods is primarily due to the 4249 million increase in aircraft fuel expense including hedging gains and losses compared to the prior period 475 million of fleet transition costs and 129 million of restructuring charges partially offset by a 1514 million increase in operating revenues 

  

  

  

alaska revenues 

  

total operating revenues increased 1514 million or 49 in 2008 as compared to 2007 the components of alaska’s revenue are summarized in the following table 

  

  

   

operating revenue—mainline 

  

mainline passenger revenue for the full year increased 38 on flat capacity and a 37 increase in passenger revenues per available seat mile prasm the increase in mainline prasm was the result of a 23 increase in yields and a 11point increase in load factor compared to the prioryear period an increase in mileage plan redemption revenue and higher ancillary fee revenue contributed significantly to the increase in yields compared to 2007 although capacity and traffic were relatively flat traffic declined in the third and fourth quarters as the economic recession deepened in response we reduced capacity with the most significant reductions taking place in the fourth quarter 

  

  

 our advance bookings currently suggest that load factors will be relatively flat in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 although that is with a 10 to 11 decline in capacity 

  

freight and mail revenues increased 51 million or 54 over 2007 the increase is due to increased yields for freight and mail and freight fuel surcharges partially offset by a decline in freight volumes compared to the prior year as fuel prices decline fuel surcharge revenue is also expected to decline in 2009 

  

other—net revenues declined 119 million or 81 primarily as a result of lower commission revenue on the sale of mileage plan miles to our nonairline partners we anticipate lower sales of miles to our affinity card partner in 2009 as general consumer credit card spending declines due to the economic recession 

  

change in mileage plan terms 

  

beginning in august 2008 we reduced the length of time that a mileage plan account could be inactive from three years to two years before the account is deleted as a result of this change in terms our mileage plan liability was reduced by 423 million this benefit is recorded separately in operating revenues as “change in mileage plan terms” 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity increased by 194 million over the same period in 2007 because of a 57 increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity unit revenues have increased due to a 68 increase in yields offset by a 07point decline in load factors compared to 2007 

  

alaska expenses 

  

for the year total operating expenses increased 4941 million or 173 compared to 2007 as a result of higher mainline operating costs most notably aircraft fuel expense including hedging gains and losses fleet transition charges and restructuring charges we believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management 

  

   

mainline operating expenses 

  

significant mainline operating expense variances are described below 

  

along with our financial and statistical data on page 34 we are presenting here our lineitem expenses on a perasm basis in cents we believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity 

  

   

   

additional line item information is provided below 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits decreased during the full year of 2008 by 112 million or 15 primarily as a result of lower definedbenefit pension costs overtime and a 05 decrease in fulltime equivalent employees compared to 2007 

  

we currently expect wages and benefits to be flat in 2009 but to increase on a perasm basis although we expect a significant decline in fulltime equivalent employees resulting from the recent reduction in work force our definedbenefit pension costs are increasing substantially from 48 million in 2008 to an estimated 93 million next year because of poor market returns in 2008 this expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay for 2008 increased 23 million or 170 compared to 2007 the increase is primarily due to higher payouts under our operational performance reward program offset by lower overall payouts in our profitsharing plans due to the decline in profitability from 2007 for our incentive pay plans profit is generally defined as results excluding fleet transition costs restructuring charges and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis air group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all of our employees and create alignment for employees customers and shareholders these plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that to a large extent are based on certain annual financial targets 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our portfolio of hedges included in our income statement as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instruments as crude oil prices increase or decrease raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes and fees raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 4249 million or 576 compared to 2007 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

fuel gallons consumed decreased 58 due to the decrease in capacity and the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we completed the fleet transition out of the lessefficient md80 aircraft to newer moreefficient b737800 aircraft on relatively flat capacity for the year because the b737800 aircraft are larger than the md80s the flat capacity came on a 26 decline in revenue block hours 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 421 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs for much of the year crude oil prices have declined dramatically since the record high set in july 2008 based on the current price of jet fuel we expect that the raw fuel price per gallon in the first quarter of 2009 will be significantly lower than in the same period of 2008 

  

during 2008 we recorded significant marktomarket losses reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel 

  

 prices declined sharply late in the year during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the price of crude oil 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense  which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period under their original contract expiration terms offset by the premium expense that we paid for those contracts a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio when we refer to economic fuel expense  we include gains only when they are realized through a cash receipt from our hedge contract counterparties for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract settlement terms we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

the total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008 excluding hedges that were terminated early increased by 569 million to 1018 million compared to 2007 this increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices during the year 

  

as part of our effort to restructure our fuelhedge portfolio as noted earlier we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions having lower average strike prices as a result we realized losses of approximately 415 million representing the difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts we do not anticipate further restructuring of the portfolio at this time based on current jet fuel prices we expect our economic fuel expense to be lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of lower crude oil prices

aircraft rent declined by 66 million or 59 during 2008 because of the retirement of all remaining leased md80 aircraft offset by one additional leased b737800 aircraft since 2007 we expect aircraft rent will be flat to slightly higher in 2009 as the elimination of the md80 rent is offset by lease expense on b737800 aircraft as we plan to finance six aircraft with saleleaseback transactions 

  

landing fees and other rents 

  

landing fees and other rents declined by 24 million or 14 compared to 2007 the decline is primarily attributable to the decline in departures resulting in lower landing fees across the system however looking forward into 2009 even though we are expecting capacity and departure declines airport costs may not decline ratably airport costs are generally spread across the airlines based on passenger counts and departures as the industry cuts capacity airport costs on a perpassenger or perdeparture basis will likely increase 

  

   

contracted services 

  

during 2008 contracted services increased by 61 million or 49 compared to 2007 this is primarily due to efforts to improve our operational performance and the introduction of new stations in our route system where we contract airport services we expect contracted services to decline approximately 5 in 2009 as we decrease our departures across the system and require less handling at airports 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses declined 133 million or 103 compared to 2007 the decline is driven by lower ticket distribution fees and lower expenses associated with our mileage plan program we expect selling expenses to increase slightly in 2009 primarily driven by increases in our advertising and marketing efforts tied to our initiative to increase unit revenues 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 236 million or 166 compared to 2007 as a result of the delivery of 11 b737800 aircraft delivered in 2008 we expect depreciation and amortization to be about flat in 2009 although we took delivery of 11 new aircraft in 2008 and expect ten more in 2009 we expect to sell up to four b737700 aircraft and complete saleleaseback transactions for six b737800s 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses increased primarily because of higher personnel and crew costs property taxes and legal fees partially offset by a decline in passenger remuneration costs stemming from our improved operational performance 

  

restructuring charges and fleet transition costs 

  

in the third quarter of 2008 we announced reductions in work force among union and nonunion employees the nonunion employees that were affected by the reduction were terminated in the third quarter resulting in a 16 million severance charge for union personnel we offered extended leaves a voluntary furlough program and an earlyout package with a lumpsum payment based on years of service that included continuation of medical coverage and travel privileges for a specified period in addition to the voluntary offers there have been involuntary furloughs to achieve the target reduction in work force we recorded an 113 million charge in 2008 representing the severance payments and estimated medical coverage obligation for the affected union employees 

  

during 2008 we retired four md80 aircraft that were under longterm lease arrangements and placed them in temporary storage at an aircraft storage facility the 475 million charge in the period represents the remaining lease payments under the lease contract and our estimate of maintenance costs that will be incurred in the future to meet the minimum return conditions under the lease requirements 

  

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our costreduction efforts our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 

  

  

   

 we have separately listed in the above table our fuel costs restructuring charges and fleet transition costs per asm these amounts are included in casm but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and certain special items to measure our costreduction progress we believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we currently forecast our mainline costs per asm excluding fuel for the first quarter and the full year of 2009 to be up 11 to 12 and up 7 to 8 respectively compared to 2008 the increase in unit costs on a fullyear basis is primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

purchased capacity costs 

  

purchased capacity costs increased 109 million to 3137 million during 2008 compared to 3028 million in 2007 of the total 2937 million was paid to horizon under the capacity purchase arrangement cpa for 14 billion asms this expense is eliminated in consolidation 

  

horizon air 

  

horizon reported a loss before income taxes of 558 million during 2008 compared to 107 million in 2007 the 451 million decline in profitability is primarily due to higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs partially offset by lower nonfuel operating costs and higher operating revenues 

  

horizon revenues 

  

in 2008 operating revenues increased 155 million or 22 compared to 2007 horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the table below 

  

   

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below in the cpas horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity as a result yield and load factor information for the cpa arrangements are not presented 

  

  

   

 systemwide horizon’s operating unit revenues increased 124 compared to 2007 however the increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of frontier jetexpress flying which produced relatively low rasm because of the nature of the contract to higher rasm brand and alaska cpa flying as mentioned earlier the frontier jetexpress operation ceased in november 2007 

  

horizon brand flying includes routes in the horizon system not covered by the alaska cpa horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets passenger revenue from horizon brand flying increased 379 million or 97 on a 65 increase in brand capacity and a 32 increase in unit revenues the increase in unit revenues was due to a 41 increase in yields in those markets partially offset by a 07point decline in load factor 

  

revenue from the cpa with alaska totaled 2937 million during 2008 compared to 2834 million in 2007 the increase is primarily driven by the 27 increase in unit revenues on relatively flat capacity under the cpa the fee paid by alaska is based on horizon’s operating costs plus a specified margin this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 

  

horizon expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 557 million or 77 as compared to 2007 along with our financial and statistical data on page 35 we are presenting here our line item expenses on a perasm basis in cents 

  

   

   

significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits decreased 72 million or 36 primarily as a result of a 51 decrease in ftes we expect that wages and benefits will decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 as we continue to reduce capacity resulting in fewer fulltime equivalent employees 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 972 million or 700 compared to 2007 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

the 32 increase in consumption was driven by the elimination of frontier jetexpress flying in 2007 as those aircraft were redeployed into the horizon fleet horizon began purchasing the fuel whereas under the jetexpress arrangement fuel was purchased by frontier offsetting these increases in fuel consumption is the decline in system capacity which has led to lower fuel consumption needs additionally we have had improved fuel efficiency of our fleet resulting from new q400 aircraft deliveries as they replaced outgoing q200 aircraft 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 394 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher average crude oil costs and refinery margins 

  

as at alaska we recorded significant marktomarket losses in 2008 reflecting a steep decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio as fuel prices declined sharply throughout the year during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

the total net cash benefit from hedges that settled during 2008 excluding hedges that were terminated early increased by 124 million to 209 million compared to 2007 this increase was primarily due to the record high crude oil prices during the year 

  

like alaska as part of the effort to restructure our fuelhedge portfolio we terminated a number of contracts originally scheduled to settle in 2009 and 2010 and replaced them with new positions with lower average strike prices as a result we realized losses of approximately 85 million representing the difference between the original premiums paid for those contracts when purchased and the amount of cash received from the counterparty on termination of the contracts we do not anticipate further restructuring of the portfolio at this time based on current jet fuel prices we expect our economic fuel expense to be lower in 2009 than in 2008 because of lower crude oil prices 

  

 aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense decreased 338 million or 367 primarily as a result of fewer maintenance events and cost savings from process improvements we currently expect that maintenance expense will increase in 2009 as we are planning for more scheduled events compared to 2008 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent decreased 87 million or 133 from 2007 due to the lease termination of a number of q200 aircraft along with the sublease of additional q200 aircraft and two crj700 aircraft to third parties we expect that aircraft rent will decline in 2009 as a result of the further transition out of leased crj700 aircraft 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 36 million or 106 as a result of the two new q400s that were delivered in 2008 and the fullyear depreciation on 13 q400s delivered in 2007 we own all of these new aircraft we anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase in 2009 as we take delivery of five more q400s in the first quarter of 2009 

  

fleet transition costs 

  

fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of q200 aircraft were 87 million during 2008 compared to 141 million in 2007 all 16 of the q200 aircraft under the existing sublease arrangement have been delivered although we continue to be obligated under the head leases on subleased aircraft the discounted future lease payments are recorded as fleet transition costs at the time of the removal of the aircraft from operations we also recorded a 15 million charge associated with six additional q200s that were removed from operating service in 2008 and returned to the lessor 

  

during 2008 as a result of the board’s decision to retire the crj700 fleet earlier than expected we recorded a 55 million impairment charge associated with two owned crj700 aircraft and related spare parts 67 million associated with a net loss on the sublease arrangement for two leased crj700 aircraft and 13 million for severance charges related to a reduction in work force we expect to have further charges related to the exit of the crj700 fleet in 2009 although we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of those charges at this time 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 

  

  

   

we currently forecast our costs per asm excluding fuel and the crj fleet transition costs to be up about 3 to 4 and 6 to 7 for the first quarter and full year 2009 respectively compared to 2008 the expected fullyear increase in unit costs is primarily attributable to the expected 8 to 10 capacity reduction and an increase in maintenance costs offset by declines in q200 fleet transition costs other nonfuel operating costs 

  

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 410 million in 2008 compared to 104 million in 2007 interest income declined by 115 million compared to 2007 primarily as a result of lower average portfolio returns partially offset by a higher average cash and marketable securities balance interest expense increased 143 million because of new debt arrangements in 2007 and 2008 partially offset by lower interest rates on our variablerate debt capitalized interest declined 46 million from 2007 

  

   

resulting from a decrease in predelivery deposits in connection with our orders for b737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on income loss before income taxes for 2008 was 363 compared to an effective income tax rate of 380 in 2007 the effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by 21 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in note 11 excluding this benefit our effective tax rate would have been 390 the difference between the effective tax rates for both periods and our marginal tax rate of approximately 375 is primarily the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards 

  

2007 compared with 2006 

  

our consolidated net income for 2007 was 1243 million or 307 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 545 million or 144 per share in 2006 

  

both the 2007 and 2006 results include adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from marktomarket accounting on fuel hedge portfolio and other certain significant items noted below that affect the comparability of the years 

  

   

   

we believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors because of the reasons provided above in the “2008 compared with 2007” section 

  

alaska airlines 

  

alaska reported income before income taxes of 2150 million during 2007 compared to a loss before income taxes of 947 million in 2006 the 3097 million difference between the years is primarily due to the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling 2184 million 

  

alaska revenues 

  

total operating revenues increased 3774 million or 140 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the capacity purchase agreement with horizon which was new in 2007 made up 2650 million of the increase with mainline revenues contributing 1124 million of the increase 

  

operating revenue—mainline 

  

mainline passenger revenue increased 38 on a 40 increase in available seat miles offset by a modest decline in mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm the slight decline in prasm was the result of a 03 increase in yields offset by a 04point decline in load factor compared to the prior period 

  

freight and mail revenue was flat compared to 2006 this is primarily due to a decline in freight and mail volumes resulting from lower capacity that stemmed from the delay in the conversion of four of our b737400 passenger aircraft to combi aircraft offset by an increase in cargo yields including those coming through fuel surcharges 

  

other—net revenues increased 175 million or 135 primarily as a result of higher commission revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits to our bank partner 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity 

  

passenger revenue —purchased capacity increased by 2650 million to 2814 million because of the cpa with horizon in 2006 horizon recorded 2215 million in revenues for markets covered by the prior revenuesharing arrangement yields in those markets declined 33 and load factor increased 15 points on a 297 increase in capacity 

  

 alaska expenses 

  

for the year total operating expenses increased 649 million compared to 2006 as a result of new purchased capacity costs recorded under the cpa with horizon offset by a decline in mainline operating costs 

  

mainline operating expenses 

  

total mainline operating costs for 2007 declined by 2236 million or 80 compared to 2006 the absence of the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges in 2007 and lower aircraft fuel expense resulting from marktomarket gains associated with the value of our fuel hedge portfolio were the primary causes of the decline 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits were relatively flat in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of the following 

  

   

   

   

these increases were offset by the following 

  

   

   

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay for 2007 decreased 142 million or 513 compared to 2006 the decrease results from lower annual expense under the various air group profitbased incentive plans as our profitability was lower than originally expected offset by higher expenses associated with our operational performance rewards plan 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel decreased 195 million or 26 in 2007 compared to 2006 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

fuel gallons consumed were flat on a 40 increase in capacity because of the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we transitioned out of the lessefficient md80 aircraft to newer moreefficient b737800 aircraft 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 79 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs 

  

during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 in 2006 we recorded a marktomarket loss as oil prices on december 31 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier 

  

   

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance declined by 70 million or 45 compared to the prior year largely as a result of the benefits of our fleet transition as we replaced our aging md80s and b737200c aircraft with newer b737800 and converted b737400 aircraft respectively 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent increased by 19 million or 17 because of the sale and shortterm leaseback of substantially all of our owned md80 aircraft during the second quarter of 2007 and the addition of two new leased b737800 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by the buyout of five leased md80 aircraft in the third quarter of 2006 

  

landing fees and other rentals 

  

landing fees and other rentals increased by 119 million or 75 compared to 2006 as a result of higher costs at seattletacoma international and other airports 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses declined by 122 million or 86 compared to 2006 as a result of lower ticket distribution costs and credit card fees that resulted from new contracts that were put into place in the fourth quarter of 2006 the 2006 amount also included 37 million paid to horizon under the revenuesharing arrangement in certain designated markets that existed in 2006 compared to zero in 2007 because of the new cpa these declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 45 million or 33 compared to 2006 this is primarily the result of 10 new b737800 aircraft delivered in 2006 and 14 in 2007 partially offset by the sale and leaseback of 20 md80s in 2007 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses increased because of higher passenger remuneration costs crew costs professional fees software license and maintenance costs higher property taxes and other costs offset by lower liability insurance expense because of better rates negotiated in december 2006 

  

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our costreduction efforts our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 

  

  

   

 horizon air 

  

horizon reported a loss before income taxes of 107 million during 2007 compared to income before income taxes of 113 million in 2006 the 220 million decrease is primarily due to higher operating costs including higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs of 141 million partially offset by higher operating revenues 

  

horizon air revenues 

  

in 2007 operating revenues increased 744 million or 116 compared to 2006 

  

  

horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the table below 

  

   

horizon’s systemwide operating revenues per asm increased by 19 from 2006 the increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of frontier jetexpress flying which produced relatively low rasm because of the terms of the contract and the longerhaul nature of the flying to higher rasm brand and alaska cpa flying 

  

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below in both cpa arrangements horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity as a result yield and load factor information for the cpa arrangements are not presented 

  

  

   

   

horizon brand flying includes routes in the horizon system not covered by the alaska cpa horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets passenger revenue from horizon brand flying increased 322 million or 90 on a 196 increase in brand capacity offset by an 88 decline in unit revenues the decline in unit revenues was due to a 24point reduction in load factor along with a 59 decline in yields resulting from increased competition in many of these brand markets and from intentional pricing actions taken in certain markets to fill the additional capacity 

  

revenue from the cpa with alaska totaled 2834 million during 2007 under the cpa the fee paid by alaska is based on horizon’s actual operating costs plus a specified margin under the prior revenuesharing arrangement alaska made a payment to horizon equal to horizon’s loss in those markets if any and a quarterly bonus that was based on alaska’s overall operating margin alternatively horizon made a payment to alaska if those markets were profitable 

  

revenue from the frontier jetexpress flying declined 343 from 525 million in 2006 to 345 million in 2007 on a 381 decline in asms the asm decline is consistent with the winddown of the jetexpress arrangement that occurred throughout 2007 

  

horizon expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 868 million or 137 as compared to 2006 

  

explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased 116 million or 61 as a result of a slight increase in fulltime equivalent employees higher wages due to market and step increases and an increase in our group medical costs 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 223 million or 191 compared to 2006 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

the 193 increase in consumption was driven by the return of all nine crj700s from frontier jetexpress and the introduction of several new q400s into the fleet replacing smaller q200s under the frontier jetexpress arrangement fuel was purchased by frontier 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 10 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs 

  

during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 in 2006 we recorded a marktomarket loss as oil prices on december 31 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier 

  

 we realized gains of 85 million from settled hedge contracts in 2007 compared to 141 million in 2006 our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

like alaska our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years the total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined to 85 million in 2007 from 141 million in 2006 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense increased 181 million or 245 primarily as a result of a higher number of engine events including scheduled events on our crj700 engines 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent declined by 37 million or 53 primarily as a result of the reduction in the number of leased q200 aircraft in our operating fleet these leased aircraft were replaced with new owned q400s during the year 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 154 million or 832 as a result of the 13 new q400s that were delivered in 2007 we own all of these new aircraft 

  

fleet transition costs 

  

fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of q200 aircraft were 141 million in 2007 as a result of 11 q200 aircraft that were delivered to a third party 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

as discussed above operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our costreduction efforts 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 

  

   

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 104 million in 2007 compared to 05 million in 2006 interest income declined by 04 million compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a lower average cash and marketable securities balance partially offset by higher average portfolio returns interest expense increased 100 million because of new debt arrangements in 2006 and 2007 and increases in the average interest rate on our variablerate debt this increase was offset by the conversion to equity of our 150 million senior convertible notes in april 2006 which eliminated further interest expense on those notes othernet increased 26 million and includes a 375 million expense in 2007 associated with our investment in row 44 given their early stage nature capitalized interest increased 31 million from 2006 resulting from an increase in predelivery deposits in connection with our orders for b737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

   

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on income loss before income taxes for 2007 was 380 compared to an effective income tax rate of 400 in 2006 the effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by 21 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in note 11 excluding this benefit our effective tax rate would have been 390 which is different from our marginal 2007 tax rate of 374 the difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards the 2006 year includes 55 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006 excluding this benefit our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 338 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our many travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue when the cash is received the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2008 we had approximately 113 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 6904 million both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

  

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles 

  

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as fare levels change our deferral rate changes which may result in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter for example due to the yearoveryear increases in average ticket prices our deferral rate increased in 2008 resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold holding all other 

  

 assumptions constant an additional 1 increase in the deferral rate would have reduced our 2008 commission revenue by approximately 26 million 

  

2 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel breakage 

  

members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel therefore based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts we estimate how many miles will never be used “breakage” and do not record a liability for those miles our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members’ accounts account balances and other factors we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations a hypothetical 10 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 73 million effect on the liability actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates 

  

3 the number of miles used per award ie free ticket 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska horizon or other airlines 

  

4 the number of awards redeemed for travel on alaska or horizon versus other airlines 

  

the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

  

5 the costs that will be incurred to provide award travel 

  

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on alaska or horizon incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we review significant mileage plan assumptions each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

pension plans 

  

we account for the definedbenefit pension plans using sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 sfas 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial 

  

   

statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income under sfas no 158 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 480 million 626 million and 783 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect the 2009 expense to be significantly higher as a result of the substantial decline in the market value of the plan’s assets in 2008 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2008 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 775 this rate was developed using historical data the current value of the underlying assets as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2008 is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixed income securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 775 to 725 would increase our estimated 2009 pension expense by approximately 33 million 

  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 620 and 600 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the discount rate at december 31 2008 was determined using current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from the pension plans decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 620 to 570 would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2008 by approximately 789 million and increase estimated 2009 pension expense by approximately 88 million 

  

with the exception of the plan covering alaska’s pilots all of our definedbenefit pension plans are closed to new entrants 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 32 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

  

in 2006 we recorded an impairment charge totaling 1311 million to write down our md80 fleet to its estimated fair market value resulting from our decision to exit the fleet earlier than originally planned additionally we bought five md80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft the total purchase price for the five aircraft was 809 million including assumed debt of 116 million immediately upon purchase of the aircraft we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable as a result we recorded an additional 584 million charge in the third quarter of 2006 for the impairment see note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the impairment of the md80s 

  

 in 2007 horizon announced plans to phase out its remaining leased q200 aircraft and is actively remarketing the remaining six leased operating aircraft all of these aircraft are leased under operating lease agreements as a result of this decision we reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the related rotable and repairable q200 parts and as such we have now depreciated these parts down to their estimated salvage value we are in the process of disposing of these parts 

  

in 2008 horizon announced plans to exit its crj700 fleet as soon as possible dependent on the ability to remarket the aircraft as a result of the decision we determined that the two owned crj700s were impaired and recorded an impairment charge on the aircraft and their related spare parts of 55 million in 2008 to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value we have reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the two owned aircraft and the related spare parts and are depreciating those assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 

  

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft 

  

prospective accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial standards sfas no 141r business combinations  and sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements these standards were issued jointly and will require most identifiable assets liabilities noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders both statements are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 sfas no 141r will be applied only to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and sfas no 160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests including any that arose before the effective date we do not expect these statements to have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133  sfas 161 requires entities that use derivative instruments to provide certain qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments amounts and location of the derivatives in the financial statements among other disclosures sfas 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged because of the importance and prominence of the company’s fuelhedging program management believes that the current disclosures included in quarterly and annual filings include many of the disclosures required under sfas 161 therefore we currently do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas 161 will have a material impact on the disclosures already provided 

  

in december 2008 the fasb issued staff position fas 132r1 amending sfas 132r employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which among other things expands the disclosures regarding assets in an employer’s pension and postretirement benefit plans the primary change would be to add the fair value hierarchy disclosures required by sfas no 157 as it relates to the underlying assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans the disclosures required by this position are effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 this position will only impact our financial statement disclosures and will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

because of the current tumultuous economic environment and uncertain demand conditions we continue to have a significant focus on preserving our liquidity position in addition to the bank lineofcredit and predelivery payment facilities described below other sources of liquidity may include financing other assets such as the 10 unencumbered aircraft in our fleet aircraft parts or receivables or a “forward sale” of mileage credits to our bank partner we plan to sell up to four b737700 aircraft in 2009 and we have agreements to complete saleleaseback financing for six b737800 by the end of february 2009 the saleleaseback transactions are expected to result in gross proceeds of 231 million the current economic environment is hindering the remarketing effort for the b737700 aircraft and there is no assurance that we will be able to sell these aircraft at an acceptable price 

  

we believe that our current cash and marketable securities of 11 billion combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will fund our operations for the foreseeable future in our cash and marketable securities portfolio we invest only in us government securities assetbacked obligations and corporate debt securities we do not invest in equities or auctionrate securities as of december 31 2008 our net unrealized loss on our 11 billion cash and marketable securities balance was 40 million 

  

our overall investment strategy for our marketable securities portfolio has a primary goal of maintaining and securing its investment principal our investment portfolio is managed by reputable financial institutions and continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy 

  

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2008 our cash and marketable securities increased 2546 million to 11 billion the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase and our expectation of future cash requirements 

  

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 1643 million compared to 4820 million during 2007 the decline of 3177 million was primarily driven by a 2776 million increase in economic fuel costs which approximates the actual cash paid for fuel during the period furthermore we had a 44 million difference in the timing of cash payments received from customers for future travel and we had cash outlays of approximately 156 million of premium cost for new fuelhedge contracts in 2008 compared to only 17 million in 2007 these declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by the 1566 million increase in operating revenues in 2008 we typically generate positive cash flows from operations but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash plus additional debt proceeds for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2009 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures associated with our fleet transitions and to a lesser extent purchases 

  

 and sales of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 5813 million during 2008 compared to 6018 million in 2007 our capital expenditures declined by 4216 million as a result of the purchase of 11 b737800s and two q400s in 2008 versus the purchase of 14 b737800s and 13 q400s in 2007 this amount was partially offset by the return of 80 million of predelivery payments from boeing resulting from the delay in aircraft deliveries 

  

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 455 million of which 405 million is expected to be aircraftrelated during 2009 as we take delivery of ten new b737800s and five new q400s capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2010 as we near the end of our committed firm aircraft deliveries we do have a number of options for both b737800 and q400 aircraft available should we decide to convert those into firm commitments however a decision to exercise those options is highly dependent on our ability to deploy those new aircraft profitably and generate returns that exceed our cost of capital 

  

cash provided by financing activities 

  

we finance a large portion of our capital spending with debt financing net cash provided by financing activities was 4958 million during 2008 compared to 934 million during 2007 we obtained debt financing for 12 b737800 aircraft and 15 q400 aircraft during 2008 as we endeavored to increase our cash and marketable securities portfolio to help sustain us through the period of significantly high fuel prices and to prepare us for the current economic environment we also borrowed 1949 million on our predelivery payment facility during the year and drew down 75 million on our bank line of credit facility offsetting the borrowings were 3432 million of debt payments and the repurchase of 489 million of our common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program 

  

we plan to meet our significant capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand along with additional debt financing and proceeds from our predelivery payment facility we have financing already in place for deliveries of our q400s through 2010 and we are actively pursuing financing alternatives for the b737800 deliveries including saleleaseback transactions or traditional debt financing given the current distress in the financial markets we may not be able to obtain financing with terms that are acceptable 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

alaska has a 185 million variablerate credit facility that expires in march 2010 as of december 31 2008 75 million is outstanding on this credit facility which is classified as current longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet on september 24 2008 we entered into the fourth amendment to the credit facility that eliminated all previous financial covenants and replaced them with a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of 500 million see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

predelivery payment facility 

  

alaska’s 172 million variablerate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of the predelivery funding requirements of alaska’s purchase of boeing 737800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement the maximum available amount is reduced to 152 million beginning in august 2009 the facility expires on august 31 2011 the interest rate is based on onemonth libor plus a specified margin borrowings are secured by alaska’s rights under the boeing purchase agreement the principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid when alaska takes delivery of the aircraft if not sooner as of december 31 2008 399 million was outstanding under this facility all of which is classified as current portion of longterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

   

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

at december 31 2008 we had firm orders to purchase 33 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately 7534 million as set forth below alaska has options to acquire 45 additional b737s and horizon has options to acquire ten q400s in addition to aircraft purchased during 2008 as previously discussed alaska took delivery of one b737800 aircraft under an operating lease arrangement 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year as of december 31 2008 

  

  

   

three of the b737800 aircraft and two of the q400 aircraft were delivered subsequent to december 31 2008 but before the filing of this form 10k these aircraft were paid for with cash on hand but are expected to be financed with longterm debt or saleleaseback arrangements the remaining aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2009 are expected to be delivered in the first six months of the year 

  

because of our capacity reduction plans and the uncertainty around the ultimate disposal of horizon’s crj700 fleet we have deferred q400 deliveries from 2009 into 2010 and 2011 due to the boeing mechanics strike in 2008 five of our expected 2008 b737800 deliveries were delayed to 2009 and one of our 2009 deliveries was delayed to 2010 our working relationships with boeing and bombardier have historically allowed us to renegotiate aircraft delivery schedules under certain circumstances specifically the recent deferral of q400 deliveries at horizon we believe our relationship with these suppliers will continue to allow us some flexibility with aircraft deliveries in the future should we need to adjust our capacity plans 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2008 

  

  

      

 pension obligations 

  

the table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans which could be approximately 45 million to 75 million per year based on our historical funding practice although there is no minimum required contribution in 2009 in addition recent market performance resulted in a decline in the fair value of plan assets and an increase in the unfunded liability for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to 4449 million at december 31 2008 this results in a 594 funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 862 funded as of december 31 2007 

  

credit card agreements 

  

we have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services under these agreements there are material adverse change clauses that if triggered could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables under one such agreement we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement we are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements but if we were our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed 

  

effect of inflation and price changes 

  

inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income 

  

other 

  

we strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business our targeted return on invested capital roic is 10 we have not historically reached this threshold nor did we in 2008 or 2007 however our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   

we have interestrate risk on our variablerate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of our hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

market risk – aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists almost exclusively of crude oil call options we utilize the contracts in our portfolio as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of fuel prices allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing fuel prices with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts although to a lesser extent we also use collar structures for fuel hedging purposes we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2008 would increase or decrease the fair value of our hedge portfolio by approximately 139 million and 124 million respectively 

  

additionally we have entered into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay for 

  

   

approximately 40 of our fuel consumption in the first quarter of 2009 

  

our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth 283 million at december 31 2008 for which we have paid 891 of premiums to counterparties compared to a portfolio value of 1125 million at december 31 2007 the total value of 283 million at december 31 2008 is net of a 241 million liability associated with collar structures that would require future cash outlays if oil prices remained below the strike price we do not have any collateral held by counterparties to these agreements as of december 31 2008 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

financial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2008 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 18 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we have fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements over the past several years additionally several of our new debt arrangements entered into during 2006 through 2007 are fixedrate arrangements due to the current low interest rate environment all of our 2008 debt arrangements have been fixedrate arrangements our variablerate debt is approximately 20 of our total longterm debt at december 31 2008 compared to 40 at december 31 2007 

  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2008 interest income would increase by approximately 91 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of december 31 2008 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer collectively our “certifying officers” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures these disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our current and periodic reports filed with or submitted to the securities and exchange commission the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our certifying officers on a timely basis our certifying officers concluded based on their evaluation that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2008 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes to the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation during the year ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso framework based on our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 

  

we intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our controls and procedures 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 which report appears on page 99

alaska air group inc 

  

we have audited alaska air group inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso alaska air group inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion alaska air group inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of alaska air group inc as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2008 and our report dated february 18 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

 other information 

  

seasonality and other factors 

  

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic it generally increases in the second quarter and typically reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska 

  

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to those factors listed above seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures such as maintenance events and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and reaccommodation of displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions 

  

   

particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

  

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers 

  

insurance 

  

we carry airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice to cover damage to aircraft spare parts and spare engines as well as bodily injury and property damage to passengers and third parties since the september 11 2001 attacks this insurance program excludes coverage for war and allied perils including hijacking terrorism malicious acts strikes riots civil commotion and other identified perils so the company has also purchased war risk coverage for such events through the us government 

  

over the last several years alaska air group has experienced dramatic reductions in the cost of its airline hull spares and comprehensive legal liability insurance program through a combination of factors these factors include a general softening of aviation insurance market conditions demonstration of alaska air group’s stateoftheart safety program to insurers and better alignment with industry rates designed to improve costs and support in the aviation insurance market 

  

other government matters 

  

we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program whereby we make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military callup the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft participation in the program is a prerequisite for bidding on various government travel contracts

alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 we offer extensive northsouth service within the western us canada and mexico and passenger and dedicated cargo services to and within the state of alaska we also provide longhaul eastwest service to eight cities in the continental us primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do offer longhaul departures from anchorage los angeles and portland oregon during 2007 we also initiated service to hawaii with nonstops from seattle to honolulu and lihue and from anchorage to honolulu 

  

in 2007 we carried 176 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations and in each year since 1973 we have carried more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on the 

  

 number of passengers alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2007 revenues the leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlesan diego at december 31 2007 alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 115 jet aircraft compared to 114 aircraft as of december 31 2006 

  

alaska’s passenger traffic by market is presented below 

  

   

horizon 

  

horizon air industries a washington corporation that first began service and was incorporated in 1981 and was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves a number of cities in six states and six cities in canada under the horizon brand in 2008 horizon began service to loreto mexico from los angeles and will serve its seventh city in canada when it begins service to prince george british columbia in may 2008 in addition to operating under its own brand horizon operated regional jet service as frontier jetexpress through the end of november 2007 under an agreement with frontier airlines horizon terminated this agreement with frontier at that time and has redeployed the nine crj700s back into the air group route structure 

  

in 2007 horizon carried 76 million revenue passengers approximately 92 of horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2007 were flown domestically primarily in the states of washington oregon and idaho compared to 91 in 2006 the canada markets accounted for 8 of revenue passenger miles in 2007 compared to 9 in 2006 based on passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland boise and spokane based on revenues in 2007 the leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and ontarioportland at december 31 2007 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 21 jets and 49 turboprop aircraft except for those flights that were operated as frontier jetexpress horizon flights are listed under the alaska airlines designator code in airline reservation systems 

  

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient competitive connections between most points served by their systems in 2007 and 2006 approximately 22 and 24 respectively of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska 

  

industry conditions 

  

our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership costs and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results in other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy in some parts of the united states current events and available capacity 

  

in 2007 the airline industry posted its second year of net profits since 2000 however with the dramatic increase in fuel prices and a softening economy industry profits were lower than originally predicted by industry experts and analysts in 2005 and 2006 load factors and unit revenues climbed higher in the wake of strong demand and a healthy economy that strong demand and a reduction in total capacity in some regions as other major carriers shifted capacity to international routes allowed domestic carriers to raise ticket prices however there was some softening in demand for air 

  

 travel early in 2007 and unit revenues declined on a yearoveryear basis during the first half of the year unit revenues rebounded later in the year principally in response to higher passenger load factors and actions taken to help offset increases in jet fuel prices 

  

several traditional or “legacy” carriers have reorganized through bankruptcy proceedings over the past several years these carriers have gained a competitive advantage by significantly reducing their costs almost immediately in addition so called “lowcost carriers” lccs have grown significantly since 2001 and currently carry more than 30 of total us domestic passenger traffic however the line between the lccs and legacy carriers is becoming more blurred as the legacy carriers make further reductions in unit costs and the lccs face cost pressures and as the legacy carriers reduce service offerings because of their unit cost advantage the lccs and recently reorganized airlines have and continue to exert downward pressure on ticket prices compared to historical levels because of the relatively low barriers to entry and financial success of lccs we expect the expansion of lowcost and lowfare carriers to continue we compete with many of these carriers directly now and expect to compete with new entrants in the future for example virgin america a new lcc has announced plans to offer nonstop service between seattle and los angeles and between seattle and san francisco in the spring of 2008 

  

fuel 

  

our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel prices have increased dramatically over the past few years and these increases have hurt our financial results we refer to the price we pay at the airport or “into plane” price including applicable taxes as our “raw” fuel price raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and substantially more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting both alaska and horizon at a competitive disadvantage historically fuel costs have generally represented 10 to 15 of an airline’s operating costs however in recent years fuel costs have risen sharply to represent 20 to 30 of total operating costs for airlines both the crude oil and refining cost components of jet fuel are volatile and outside of our control and they can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 8 17 and 34 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

  

we almost exclusively use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices on a percentage of our planned fuel consumption with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts we also use collar structures in limited instances for fuel hedging purposes additionally we enter into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay on a certain percentage of our fuel consumption 

  

fuel costs including gains and losses stemming from changes in the value of our hedge portfolio were approximately 27 of our total operating expenses in 2007 26 in 2006 and 20 in 2005 currently a onecent change in our hedged fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 40 million in addition 

  

 to our hedging program we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices 

  

due to the competitive nature of the airline industry airlines often have been unable to immediately pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares conversely any potential benefit of lower fuel prices could be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues 

  

although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in jet fuel availability dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oilproducing areas there could be reductions in the production andor importation of crude oil resulting in price increases which could adversely affect our business if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel our business would be adversely affected 

  

marketing and competition 

  

alliances with other airlines 

  

we have marketing alliances with several other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges as well as code sharing on certain flights as shown in the table below alliances enhance our revenues by 

  

   

   

   

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation 

  

our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2007 are as follows 

  

  

    

competition 

  

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 together alaska and horizon carry approximately 32 of all us domestic passenger traffic we compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of our routes including southwest airlines united airlines northwest airlines continental airlines american airlines delta air lines us airways and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers most of these airlines are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our companies in addition competitors that have successfully reorganized out of bankruptcy have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements some of these competitors have chosen to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets continuing growth of lccs including southwest airlines airtran airways frontier airlines jetblue airways and virgin america places significant competitive pressures on us and other network carriers because the lccs have the ability to charge a lower fare for travel between similar cities as such we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation in many markets including train bus and automobile transportation 

  

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

   

our sales by channel are presented below 

  

   

employees 

  

labor costs have historically made up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements often airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition new entrants into the us airline industry generally do not have unionized work forces which can be a competitive advantage for those airlines alaska has been able to reduce wages and benefits costs from 2004 levels through a number of initiatives but we have experienced recent increases in wage and benefit costs because of normal scale and step increases 

  

 market wage increases and higher healthcare costs horizon faces similar pressures on wages and benefits we expect to see continued upward pressure on wages and benefits in the future we recognize the need to continue to improve employee productivity in order to mitigate this cost pressure and to reduce our wages and benefits on an availableseatmile basis we have initiatives underway to increase productivity and efficiency 

  

we had 14710 alaska and horizon had 10526 and 4184 respectively active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2007 compared to 14485 10454 at alaska and 4031 at horizon as of december 31 2006 wages salaries and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 30 and 28 of our total operating expenses in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

at december 31 2007 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 48 of horizon’s employees our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to appoint a federal mediator if no agreement is reached in mediation the national mediation board may declare that an impasse exists at which point the national mediation board offers binding arbitration to the parties either party may decline to submit to arbitration if either party rejects arbitration a 30day “coolingoff” period commences during that period a presidential emergency board may be established which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution the presidential emergency board process if invoked lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “coolingoff” period of 30 days at the end of the applicable “coolingoff” period unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “selfhelp” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments on the collective bargaining agreements andor the hiring of workers to replace strikers 

  

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2007 were as follows 

  

  

   

 horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2007 were as follows

regulation 

  

general 

  

the department of transportation dot and the federal aviation administration faa exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 

  

   

   

the aviation and transportation security act the security act generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures pursuant to the 

  

 security act the transportation security administration tsa is responsible for aviation security the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of passengers and property including us mail cargo carryon and checked baggage and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft the tsa performs most of these functions with its own federal employees the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights the security act imposes a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures in addition carriers are required to pay an additional amount to the tsa to cover the cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 we paid 126 million to the tsa for this security charge in 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  

airline fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the dot maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve although air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts given to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency or epa osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements we maintain our own continuing safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

  

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews the airport noise and capacity act generally requires faa approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft we believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

at december 31 2007 all of our aircraft met the stage 3 noise requirements under the airport 

noise and capacity act of 1990 however 

  

 special noise ordinances restrict the timing of flights operated by alaska horizon and other airlines at burbank long beach orange county san diego san jose and sun valley in addition due to capacity restrictions orange county reagan national long beach chicago o’hare newark and vancouver bc airports restrict the type of aircraft number of flights or the time of day that airlines can operate 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

  

customer service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds 

  

mileage plan program 

  

all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner a grocery store chain a telephone company hotels car rental agencies and other businesses alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or to terminate the program 

  

mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to capacitycontrolled seating mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity in a member’s account however we have announced plans to reduce this to two years beginning in april 2008 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 alaska estimated that approximately 37 million and 32 million respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members of those eligible awards alaska estimated that approximately 88 would ultimately be redeemed for the year 2007 approximately 870000 roundtrip and 270000 oneway flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon oneway awards were introduced in february 2007 for the years 2006 and 2005 approximately 850000 and 750000 roundtrip flight awards respectively were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 97 86 and 79 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for the years 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 243200 252600 and 239900 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 

  

for miles earned through travel on alaska or horizon and their airline partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards in the future is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost of providing award travel on alaska or horizon does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft ownership cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to its nonairline partners alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes revenue when award transportation is provided on alaska horizon or another partner airline at december 31 2007 and 2006 the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 6485 million and 5456 million respectively the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits revenue attributable to the mileage plan was 2276 million 1942 million and 1802 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

 


 item 1a risk factors 

tableend   

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline these risk factors may not be exhaustive we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the nature of competition in our markets changes 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares flight frequency frequent flyer benefits routes and service the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats over the past few years airlines have reduced domestic routes and the number of planes available which has resulted in reduced domestic industry capacity and a trend towards increased fares although capacity has declined based on a nationwide average capacity on the west coast has actually increased if airlines decide to increase their capacity further in the future this could cause fares to decline which may adversely affect our business and results of operations many of our competitors are larger than our airlines and therefore may have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than we do in addition competitors who have successfully reorganized out of bankruptcy have lowered their operating costs as a result of renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements from time to time in the past some of these competitors have chosen to add service reduce their fares or take other such competitive steps in our key markets we may be unable to compete effectively against such other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 

  

the airline industry and particularly regional airlines like horizon also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives such as buses trains or automobiles 

  

the us and mexico recently amended their bilateral agreement relating to commercial air service the amendments expand authorized service levels to cities we serve in mexico other airlines have added service to many of the city pairs we currently serve which has increased competition and has negatively affected our results of operations further increases in competition in these markets may result in additional negative pressure on our results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices and variability of jet fuel further increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 27 and 26 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively significant increases in fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations further increases will harm our financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares 

  

historically fuel costs and availability have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand we have not generally been able to increase fares to offset increases in the price of fuel until recently and we may not be able to do so in the future 

  

we utilize fuel hedges as a form of insurance against the volatility of fuel prices to manage the risk of fuel price increases we purchase call options that are designed to cap a portion of our fuel costs at designated perbarrel oil prices even with hedges we are substantially and increasingly exposed to increases in jet fuel costs as the price at which we are hedged increases 

  

 a significant increase in labor costs or change in key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 30 and 28 of our total operating expenses in 2007 and 2006 respectively as of december 31 2007 labor unions represented approximately 84 of alaska’s and 48 of horizon’s employees each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to many employees reduce employee engagement in our business and divert management’s attention from other projects disengaged employees could prevent us from achieving the operational improvements in completion rate and ontime performance that we seek 

  

in 2005 alaska and the air line pilots association alpa were unable to reach a new agreement and therefore pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that existed at the time the parties submitted the agreement to binding arbitration that arbitration decision which was effective may 1 2005 resulted in an average pilot wage reduction of 26 that contract became amendable on may 1 2007 and alaska is currently in negotiations with alpa horizon is also in negotiations with the international brotherhood of teamsters on a new pilot agreement the horizon pilot contract became amendable in september 2006 factoring in pay rates productivity measures and pension and postretirement medical benefits we believe our pilot unit costs at both alaska and horizon are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated 

  

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace this is because some of our competitors either have eliminated such obligations through bankruptcy or have never had traditional pension plans in place currently all of our definedbenefit pension plans are closed to new entrants with the exception of the plan covering alaska’s pilots 

  

finally to the extent we are unable to maintain the outsourcing or subcontracting of certain services for our business we would incur substantial costs including costs associated with hiring new employees in order to perform these services inhouse 

  

our failure to successfully reduce unit costs at both alaska and horizon could harm our business 

  

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to fund growth and take advantage of market opportunities if we are unable to further reduce our nonfuel unit costs and achieve targeted profitability we will likely not be able to grow our business and therefore our financial results may suffer 

  

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities 

  

we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of debt due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had approximately 13 billion and 12 billion of longterm debt outstanding respectively approximately 13 billion and 11 billion of which was secured by flight equipment and real property in addition to longterm debt we have 

significant other fixed obligations under operating 

  

 leases related to our aircraft airport terminal space other airport facilities and office space as of december 31 2007 future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately 11 billion for 2008 through 2012 and an aggregate of 5262 million for the years thereafter 

  

at december 31 2007 we had firm orders to purchase 46 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately 10 billion through 2011 although we have secured financing for a number of these commitments there is no guarantee that additional financing will be available when required our inability to secure the financing could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances or result in delays in or our inability to take delivery of aircraft which would impair our growth or fleetsimplification plans 

  

our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

   

   

   

we cannot ensure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements we cannot be certain now that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 

  

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including changing economic and other conditions which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations often are affected by changes in economic and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

delays and cancellations frustrate passengers reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs all of which affect our profitability due to our geographic area of operations we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub in 2007 traffic to and from seattle accounted for 62 of our total traffic 

  

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage 

  

 from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

  

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath have negatively affected the airline industry including our company more recently the foiled terror plot in the united kingdom in august 2006 resulted in new security measures that also impacted our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

immediately following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the insurance coverage available to airlines for thirdparty claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events to 50 million per event and in the aggregate in light of this development under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act and the homeland security act of 2002 as most recently amended by the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 the us government continues to offer domestic airlines either i thirdparty liability war risk coverage above 50 million or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance full hull comprehensive and thirdparty liability war risk coverage this coverage provides for the same limits of war and allied perils coverage for hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of thirdparty liability insurance carried by the airline on september 11 2001 

  

although our insurance costs have declined to pre2001 levels aviation insurers could increase their premiums again in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull comprehensive and thirdparty war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through august 31 2008 although the government may extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and 

  

 result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public in addition we could experience 

significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as 

costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or 

permanent loss from service although we strive to maintain the highest standards of safety and reliability and believe that should an accident or 

incident nevertheless occur we also currently 

maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

  

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure of these systems or by their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our computerized airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruption in changes to or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data increase our expenses and possibly cause us to temporarily cease our operations 

  

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners” including but not limited to american airlines continental airlines delta air lines and northwest airlines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our costreduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future in recent years alaska has subcontracted its heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more 

vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all although we believe that our vendor oversight and quality control is among the best in the industry if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline vendor 

  

 bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate 

existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

  

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft carriers that operate a more diversified fleet are better positioned than we are to manage such events 

  

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us department of transportation the transportation security administration and the federal aviation administration the “faa” have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines for example the faa has issued regulations covering among other things security measures collision avoidance systems noise abatement environmental restrictions safety procedures and maintenance regulations similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

  

recently there has been some discussion of an “airline passenger’s bill of rights” at both the national and state levels bills have recently been proposed in several states that will regulate airlines when operating in those specific states if these bills were to become law they could impose additional economic and resource constraints on our airlines and could negatively impact our financial performance 

  

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our stock can be influenced by many factors a number of which are outside of our control including those discussed above some of the primary factors in the volatility of our stock price are

the following tables describe the aircraft we operate and their average age at december 31 2007 

  

   

part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” discusses future orders and options for additional aircraft 

  

as of december 31 2007 47 of the 64 aircraft owned by alaska and five of the 20 aircraft owned by horizon are subject to liens securing longterm debt and the majority of the other owned alaska aircraft serve as collateral for our 185 million lineofcredit facility alaska’s leased 737400 737700 737800 and md80 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2008 and 2016 between 2009 and 2010 between 2015 and 2018 and between 2008 and 2012 respectively horizon’s leased q200 q400 and crj700 aircraft have expiration dates between 2012 and 2014 in 2018 and between 2008 and 2020 respectively alaska and horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the thenfairmarket value of the aircraft 

  

in 2006 alaska announced a plan to transition to an allboeing 737 fleet by the end of 2008 which includes the accelerated retirement of our md80 fleet in 2007 horizon announced its plan to transition out of the q200 aircraft by the end of 2009 and replace them with larger q400 aircraft giving consideration to these fleet transition plans the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet counts for alaska and horizon as of the end of each quarter in 2008 

  

  

    

although the number of aircraft in our operating fleet at the end of each period presented remains relatively consistent it is important to note that the larger b737800s and the q400s are replacing the smallergauge md80s and q200s therefore our total capacity as measured by available seat miles will increase even though the number of aircraft remains consistent 

  

 ground facilities and services 

  

alaska and horizon lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve alaska also owns terminal buildings in various cities in the state of alaska 

  

alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near seattletacoma international airport seatac in seattle washington these include a fivebay hangar and shops complex used primarily for line maintenance a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an information technology office and mainframe computer facility two office buildings and corporate headquarters complex alaska also leases a stores warehouse and office spaces for a reservation facility and for various administrative functions in kent washington alaska’s major facilities outside of seattle include a regional headquarters building an air cargo facility and a hangaroffice facility in anchorage as well as leased reservations facilities in phoenix arizona and boise idaho alaska uses its own employees for ground handling services at most of our airports in the state of alaska at other airports throughout our system those services are contracted to various thirdparty vendors 

  

horizon owns its seattle corporate headquarters building it leases an operations training and aircraft maintenance facility in portland line maintenance stations in boise pasco and seattle and temporary hangar facility in spokane for q400 modification work

overview 

  

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand the company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes all statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in the company’s filings with the securities and exchange commission this overview summarizes the mda which includes the following sections 

  

   

   

   

   

year in review 

  

in 2007 we reported consolidated net income of 1250 million compared to a net loss of 526 million in 2006 the 2006 results included the following items that impact the comparability between the periods 

  

   

   

both periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of gain or loss recognition resulting from marktomarket fuel hedge accounting – we recorded a 522 million gain in 2007 compared to an 899 million loss in 2006 

  

the revenue environment in 2007 was characterized by increased competition in our primary markets and a softer demand environment in our west coast market however yield at alaska which represents approximately 88 of consolidated revenues improved slightly as we and other carriers attempted to raise fares to cover higher fuel costs both alaska and horizon posted higher passenger traffic these factors resulted in an increase in total consolidated revenues of 1716 million 

  

our total operating expenses declined by 1277 million during 2007 compared to 2006 this decrease is primarily due to the 2006 fleet transition and restructuring charges mentioned above and marktomarket gains associated with an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio offset by increases in other operating expenses in 2007 see “results of operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses for both alaska and horizon 

  

 accomplishments 

  

accomplishments from 2007 include 

  

   

   

   

   

common stock repurchase 

  

in september 2007 our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 100 million of our common stock over a period of twelve months at december 31 2007 we had repurchased 26 million shares of common stock for a total of 628 million we believe this repurchase program enhances shareholder value and demonstrates our commitment to providing investors a return on capital employed in our business the repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury shares in our consolidated balance sheet 

  

airport of the future 

  

on october 16 2007 we unveiled the first phase of our patented “airport of the future” at seattle tacoma international airport once the project is complete additional facilities are coming online in the first half of 2008 the “airport of the future” will allow both alaska and horizon customers to check in for their flights and drop bags more quickly improve our agents’ productivity and allow us to handle more customers without increasing our airport space we debuted this concept at the ted stevens international airport in anchorage in 2004 and since that time customer wait times have been reduced significantly 

  

row 44 

  

in september 2007 alaska announced its plan to launch inflight wireless internet service in 2008 based on row 44 inc’s satellitebased broadband connectivity solution we plan to test the system on alaska’s aircraft in the first half of 2008 if the test is successful we plan to equip all of our aircraft at alaska with this equipment this technology will provide customers with a unique entertainment and business network in the air passengers with wifienabled devices – such as laptop computers pdas smart phones and portable gaming systems – will have highspeed access to the internet email virtual private networks and stored inflight entertainment content 

  

hawaiian vacations 

  

during the third quarter of 2007 alaska announced the acquisition of certain assets of hawaiian vacations inc an anchoragebased company that charters aircraft and markets package tours to the hawaiian islands the acquisition of these assets will help accelerate our entrance into the anchoragehonolulu market which began december 9 2007 with one daily round trip 

  

q400 landing gear inspections 

  

on september 12 2007 horizon temporarily grounded 19 of its 33 bombardier q400 turboprops as a precautionary measure following an alloperator message from bombardier aerospace of canada on september 13 in response to a transport canada airworthiness directive ad horizon grounded its entire q400 

  

 fleet to begin the required landing gear inspections the ad was produced in the wake of two landing gear failure incidents involving scandinavian airlines sas in europe horizon which has operated the canadianmanufactured q400 since 2001 has never experienced any issues like those encountered by sas in these incidents the inspections were completed over a 13day period and the aircraft were put back into service after that time 

  

labor costs and negotiations 

  

we are pleased with the longterm contracts that have been reached with the majority of our labor groups we are now in the process of negotiating new contracts with pilots at both alaska and horizon and with flight attendants at horizon the contract with alaska’s pilots became amendable may 1 2007 and the contract with horizon’s pilots became amendable september 12 2006 we hope to reach negotiated agreements with each of these groups that recognize the important contributions that they make to both of our airlines without harming either company’s competitive position factoring in pay rates productivity measures pension and postretirement medical benefits we believe our pilot unit costs are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated 

  

we do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be or when agreements will be reached however uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to some employees reduce employee engagement in our business and hinder us from achieving the operational goals such as ontime and completionrate targets that we have set 

  

alaska fleet transition 

  

during the first quarter of 2006 we announced our plan to retire our entire md80 fleet by the end of 2008 as part of alaska’s move to an allboeing 737 fleet we believe this transition when completed will provide more than 130 million in annual operating savings by way of lower fuel maintenance and training costs 

  

during 2007 we sold all 20 of our owned operating md80s the majority of these aircraft are now leased from the buyer under shortterm lease arrangements which will allow us to maintain our current md80 retirement schedule through december 2008 we ceased operation of seven of these leased md80s in 2007 including one at the end of december that was earlier than anticipated the charge associated with the early retirement in december 2007 was not material 

  

we currently have longterm lease arrangements on four md80 aircraft that we plan to cease operating before the end of the lease term we anticipate that once these aircraft have been removed from operation we will dispose of them through a lease buyout or a sublease arrangement or we will store them at a longterm storage facility it is likely that we will record a charge in our statement of operations if either of these events occurs aggregate minimum lease payments for these four aircraft through the end of their lease terms total approximately 685 million as of december 31 2007 

  

horizon fleet transition 

  

in 2006 horizon entered into an agreement to sublease 16 of its bombardier q200 aircraft to a third party during 2007 11 aircraft were transferred resulting in a loss on the sublease arrangement of 141 million that is reflected as “fleet transition costs – horizon” in the consolidated statements of operations we expect the average loss per aircraft to be approximately 14 million which will be recorded as each aircraft leaves the fleet 

  

in april 2007 horizon announced an order for 15 additional q400 aircraft with options for 20 more these aircraft will be delivered in 2008 and 2009 with this order we plan to phase out the remaining leased q200 aircraft by the end of 2009 and we are in the process of negotiating transactions that would allow for their exit from the fleet we believe the market has improved since the earlier q200 sublease transaction but the amount or timing of any potential loss or gain cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

  

 in 2007 horizon posted a pretax loss of 106 million we have a number of initiatives underway to improve horizon’s operating results including evaluating whether further fleet simplification of horizon’s fleet away from regional jets to an allq400 fleet would be beneficial however no decisions have been made at this time 

  

capacity purchase agreements 

  

alaska and horizon entered into a capacity purchase agreement cpa effective january 1 2007 whereby alaska purchases capacity on certain routes “capacity purchase markets” from horizon as specified by the agreement this agreement has resulted in a new presentation in alaska’s statement of operations the actual passenger revenue from the capacity purchase markets is identified as “passenger revenue – purchased capacity” and the associated costs are identified as “purchased capacity costs” 

  

alaska also has a similar arrangement in place with a thirdparty carrier for flying between anchorage and dutch harbor alaska historically the revenue from this arrangement was presented in “other revenue – net” and the associated costs were in “contracted services” in alaska’s statement of operations now all of these revenues and costs are presented with the horizon purchased capacity revenues and costs and the prior period has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

  

alaska and horizon entered into the cpa in order to improve the visibility of both the revenues and the costs of flying in the capacity purchase markets under the cpa alaska pays horizon a contractual amount for the purchased capacity in the incentive markets regardless of the revenue collected on those flights the amount paid to horizon is generally based on horizon’s operating costs plus a margin alaska bears the inventory and revenue risk in those markets accordingly alaska records the related passenger revenue alaska records payments to horizon in “purchased capacity costs” horizon records the payment from alaska as “passenger revenue” 

  

the air group planning department works to strategically deploy certain horizon aircraft by optimizing the balance of local and “flow” traffic connections with alaska in order to maximize total returns to the company and to allow alaska to deploy its larger jets to other routes prior to 2007 there was a revenuesharing arrangement in place whereby alaska made a payment to horizon if certain covered markets created losses for horizon alternatively horizon made a payment to alaska if those markets were profitable 

  

under both the revenuesharing arrangement that was previously in place and the new cpa the payments made from alaska to horizon are eliminated in consolidation and do not impact air group’s consolidated results 

  

frontier jetexpress 

  

in november 2007 horizon discontinued its contract flying with frontier airlines as frontier jetexpress we had nine crj700 aircraft dedicated to this program all of which have returned to horizon’s operating fleet two of these aircraft were returned in the first quarter one in the third quarter and the remaining six in the fourth quarter of 2007 we have used these aircraft for productive and strategic redeployments throughout horizon’s network and in capacity purchase markets with alaska however the influx of new capacity has depressed yields in some of our markets 

  

line of credit modification 

  

in april 2007 we announced the second amendment of the march 25 2005 160 million variablerate credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions the terms of the second amendment provide that any borrowings will be secured by either aircraft or cash collateral the second amendment i increased the size of the facility to 185 million ii improved the collateral advance rates for certain aircraft iii extended the agreement by two years with a maturity date of march 31 2010 and iv repriced the credit facility to reflect current market rates we currently have no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility in july 2007 we executed the third amendment to the credit facility which amended a covenant restriction to allow borrowings between alaska airlines and its affiliates of up to 500 million from 300 million previously 

  

 outlook 

  

we currently expect to increase alaska mainline capacity by 3 and reduce horizon total system capacity by 4 in 2008 compared to 2007 the expected capacity increase at alaska is due primarily to the anticipated delivery of 17 new b737800 aircraft in 2008 and the annualization of capacity additions that resulted from 14 b737800 aircraft delivered in 2007 offset by the retirement of 15 md80 aircraft and to a lesser extent scheduled retirement of other aircraft 

  

we will continue to monitor our flight schedules to see if there are further opportunities to reduce unprofitable flying and perhaps retire some of our md80s sooner than currently planned we recently announced that we will be eliminating our oakland – orange county route and alaska will shift to horizon its daily flights from seattle to reno and boise in an effort to reduce costs and increase profitability 

  

on a net basis we expect that alaska’s fleet size will grow by one aircraft in 2008 from 115 to 116 although the b737800 aircraft are larger than the md80s allowing for the capacity growth mentioned above horizon’s expected capacity decrease is due largely to the anticipated reduction of several q200 aircraft and the retirement of one crj700 offset by the delivery of four new q400 aircraft in 2008 and the annualization of 13 new q400 aircraft delivered in 2007 additionally there has been an increase in the number of seats on a portion of the fleet of q400s from 74 seats to 76 seats all q400 aircraft will have 76 seats by the end of 2008 the aircraft deliveries in 2008 at both alaska and horizon are planned to replace outgoing aircraft increase frequency in our existing markets and to a lesser degree serve new markets 

  

for much of the past three years alaska’s operational performance has fallen short of our goals and our customers’ expectations we currently have several initiatives underway to help improve our ontime performance completion rates baggage handling and other important customerdriven operational measures delivering on these core operational promises is one of our highestpriority internal goals for 2008 

  

results of operations 

  

2007 compared with 2006 

  

our consolidated net income for 2007 was 1250 million or 309 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 526 million or 139 per diluted share in 2006 several items as noted below affect the comparability between the two periods 

  

   

   

   

we believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors and other readers because 

  

   

    

   

   

our consolidated results are primarily driven by the results of our two operating carriers alaska reported pretax income of 2160 million in 2007 while horizon reported a pretax loss of 106 million in 2007 financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35 respectively an indepth discussion of the results of alaska and horizon begins on page 36 

  

 alaska airlines financial and statistical data 

  

  

  horizon air financial and statistical data 

  

  

    

 alaska airlines 

  

alaska reported income before income taxes of 2160 million during 2007 compared to a loss before income taxes of 922 million in 2006 the 3082 million difference between the periods is primarily the result of the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling 2143 million combined with a reduction in fuel expense following marktomarket fuelhedging losses recorded in 2006 as compared to marktomarket fuel hedging gains in the current year these marktomarket adjustments are a result of changes in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio driven by changes in the price of crude oil 

  

the year’s most important trend was the dramatic increase in raw and economic fuel costs and the commensurate increase in passenger revenue as we and many of our competitors attempted to pass along the increased fuel costs see page 39 for a discussion of raw and economic fuel costs 

  

alaska revenues 

  

total operating revenues increased 3774 million or 140 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the new capacity purchase agreement with horizon described above made up 2650 million of the increase with mainline revenues defined as passenger revenues from those flights operating on alaska airlines jets plus freight mail and other revenues contributing 1124 million of the increase the components of alaska’s revenue are summarized in the following table 

  

  

   

 operating revenue—mainline 

  

mainline passenger revenue increased 38 on a 40 increase in available seat miles offset by a modest decline in mainline passenger revenue per available seat mile prasm the slight decline in prasm was the result of a 03 increase in yields offset by a 04point decline in load factor compared to 2006 

  

although the load factor for the full year was down from 2006 load factors outpaced 2006 in the second half of the year after lagging 2006 in the first half of the year these load factor improvements contributed to the increase in unit passenger revenue prasm seen in the third and fourth quarters we believe the fullyear load factor decline is due to capacity growth in connection with the replacement of older aircraft with larger b737800 aircraft without a commensurate increase in the number of passengers our advance bookings currently suggest that load factors will be up 2 to 3 points in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 

  

   

freight and mail revenue was flat compared to 2006 this is primarily due to a decline in freight and mail volumes resulting from lower capacity that stemmed from the delay in the conversion of four of our b737400 passenger aircraft to combi aircraft offset by an increase in cargo yields including those coming through fuel surcharges we currently anticipate an increase in freight and mail revenues in 2008 as we expect to deploy our full capacity for the entire year 

  

other—net revenues increased 175 million or 135 primarily as a result of higher commission revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits to our bank partner when we sell mileage credits we defer the majority of the proceeds and recognize that revenue when award travel takes place commission revenue represents the difference between the proceeds from the sale of miles and the amount we defer 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity 

  

passenger revenue—purchased capacity increased by 2650 million to 2814 million because of the cpa with horizon 

  

although the markets subject to the cpa have changed slightly compared to those included under the prior revenuesharing arrangement we believe it is useful to evaluate yearoveryear revenue information to gauge actual trends in those markets this factors out the impact of the intercompany capacity purchase agreement and as a result gives readers information about the aggregate impact to air group revenues in 2006 horizon recorded 2215 million in revenues for markets covered by the prior revenue sharing arrangement yields in those markets declined 33 and load factor increased 15 points on a 297 increase in capacity 

  

 during 2007 purchased capacity costs exceeded passenger revenue—purchased capacity by 214 million however the reported results of purchased capacity flying do not reflect the total contribution of these flights to our mainline operation as many of the flights feed traffic from smaller cities 

  

alaska expenses 

  

for the year total operating expenses increased 664 million compared to 2006 as a result of new purchased capacity costs recorded under the cpa with horizon offset by a decline in mainline operating costs the components of alaska’s operating expenses are summarized in the following table 

  

  

   

mainline operating expenses 

  

total mainline operating costs for 2007 declined by 2221 million or 80 compared to 2006 the absence of the fleet transition costs and restructuring charges in 2007 and lower aircraft fuel expense resulting from marktomarket gains associated with the value of our fuel hedge portfolio were the primary causes of the decline 

  

along with our financial and statistical data on page 34 we are presenting here our lineitem expenses on a perasm basis in cents we believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity 

  

   

additional line item information is provided below 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits were relatively flat in 2007 primarily as a result of the following 

  

     

   

these increases were offset by the following 

  

   

   

we currently expect wages and benefits to increase slightly in 2008 but decline on a perasm basis this expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay for 2007 decreased 142 million or 513 compared to 2006 the decrease results from lower annual expense under the various air group profitbased incentive plans as our profitability was lower than originally expected offset by higher expenses associated with our operational performance rewards plan for purposes of our incentive pay plans profit is generally defined as results excluding fleet transition costs restructuring charges and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis air group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all of our employees and create alignment for employees customers and shareholders these plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that to a large extent are based on certain annual financial targets 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense as defined below plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio that we include in our income statement as the value of the portfolio increases and decreases by definition our aircraft fuel expense is very volatile even between quarters because it includes these gains or losses when the underlying instrument increases or decreases in value as crude oil prices increase or decrease raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport or the “intoplane” price including taxes raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers 

  

aircraft fuel expense decreased 195 million or 26 compared to 2006 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

fuel gallons consumed were flat on a 40 increase in capacity because of the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet as we transition out of the lessefficient md80 aircraft to newer moreefficient b737800 aircraft 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 79 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs 

  

during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 in 2006 we recorded a marktomarket loss as oil prices on 

  

 december 31 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the prices of crude oil 

  

we also evaluate economic fuel expense  which we define as raw fuel expense less the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period offset by the premium expense that we recognize a key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition when we refer to economic fuel expense  we include gains only when they are realized through a cash receipt from our hedge contract counterparties we believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operation accordingly many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans 

  

our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

in 2005 and 2006 we realized significant benefits from inthemoney fuel hedge contracts however our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years the total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined to 449 million in 2007 down from 870 million in 2006 and 1088 million in 2005 

  

we currently expect economic fuel expense to be higher in 2008 than in 2007 because of high crude oil prices for example if oil were to average 87 per barrel in 2008 we would expect our raw fuel expense to be approximately 267 per gallon and the cash benefit of settled hedges to be approximately 55 million resulting in an economic fuel price per gallon of approximately 252 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance declined by 70 million or 45 compared to the prior year largely as a result of the benefits of our fleet transition as we replace our aging md80s and b737200c aircraft with newer b737800 and converted b737400 aircraft respectively we currently expect maintenance expense to increase slightly in 2008 because of the timing of certain required maintenance events offset by additional benefits to be realized from the fleet transition 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent increased by 19 million or 17 because of the sale and shortterm leaseback of substantially all of our owned md80 aircraft during the second quarter of 2007 and the addition of two new leased b737800 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by the buyout of five leased md80 aircraft in the third quarter of 2006 we expect a yearoveryear increase in aircraft rent in 2008 as we lease an additional b737800 offset by the retirement of the md80s 

  

landing fees and other rentals 

  

landing fees and other rentals increased by 119 million or 75 compared to 2006 as a result of higher costs at seattletacoma international and other airports we expect yearoveryear increases in 2008 as a result of fees in our new hawaii stations and for the continuing transition to 737800 aircraft that are larger than the outgoing md80 aircraft 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses declined by 122 million or 86 compared to 2006 as a result of lower 

  

 ticket distribution costs and credit card fees that resulted from new contracts that were put into place in the fourth quarter of 2006 the 2006 amount also included 37 million paid to horizon under the revenuesharing arrangement in certain designated markets that existed in 2006 compared to zero in the current year because of the new cpa these declines were partially offset by higher advertising costs we currently expect that selling expenses will decline slightly in 2008 as we continue to focus our efforts on shifting sales to our web sites which reduces the commission we pay to outside providers 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 45 million or 33 compared to 2006 this is primarily the result of 10 new b737800 aircraft delivered in 2006 and 14 in 2007 partially offset by the sale and leaseback of 20 md80s in 2007 we expect depreciation and amortization to increase by about 14 in 2008 as we acquire more new b737800 aircraft 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses increased because of higher passenger remuneration costs crew costs professional fees software license and maintenance costs higher property taxes and other costs offset by lower liability insurance expense because of better rates negotiated in december 2006 

  

mainline operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our costreduction efforts our effort to reduce unit costs focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost 

  

our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 

  

  

   

we have separately listed in the above table our fuels costs per asm fleet transition costs per asm and restructuring charges per asm these amounts are included in casm but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude these items to measure our costreduction progress we do so and believe that such analysis may be important to investors and other readers of these financial statements for the following reasons 

  

   

   

   

    

   

   

   

our mainline unit costs excluding fuel and other special items for the first quarter and full year 2008 are expected to remain flat from similar measures in 2007 our primary goal in 2008 is to improve our operational reliability including our ontime performance completion of scheduled flights and baggage delivery metrics with a special focus on our seattle operations 

  

purchased capacity costs 

  

purchased capacity costs increased 2885 million from 143 million in 2006 to 3028 million in 2007 of the total 2834 million was paid to horizon under the new cpa for 14 billion asms the balance includes amounts paid to a third party for the dutch harbor flying which approximates the amount paid in 2006 and certain administrative and information technology costs borne by alaska that are allocated to purchased capacity flying costs 

  

in the aggregate costs of purchased capacity exceeded revenues in these markets by 214 million the markets covered by the cpa with horizon are both “flow” markets that provide connecting traffic to alaska and “local” markets where horizon’s regional jets are used to maximize returns or minimize losses to air group and allow alaska to deploy its larger jets to other routes generally speaking revenues in the flow markets exceed costs however revenue in most of the local markets falls short of costs with high fuel prices and relatively high nonfuel costs some of these routes operated by horizon are unprofitable with crj700s and are too small to support 737 service we are evaluating alternatives to improve the results of these routes alternatives include reducing the size of the crj700 fleet moving some of the flying to the q400 and having a portion of the capacity in these markets performed by a third party with larger more efficient aircraft 

  

 horizon air 

  

horizon reported a loss before income taxes of 106 million during 2007 compared to income before income taxes of 117 million in 2006 the 223 million decrease is primarily due to higher operating costs including higher fuel costs and fleet transition costs of 141 million partially offset by higher operating revenues 

  

there were several significant events in 2007 that impacted horizon’s financial results including charges associated with the transition of the q200 fleet a significant increase in maintenance costs related to scheduled engine overhauls and the integration of the nine regional jets from frontier jetexpress into the horizon network the extra capacity from the frontier jetexpress operations proved harder to integrate than was originally planned because of a softer revenue environment and unexpected competition in some of our markets despite the dramatic increase in capacity load factor declined only 07 points however the stable load factor came at the expense of yield on flying done under horizon’s own brand which declined 59 in addition to assimilating the capacity from the frontier jetexpress flying horizon also absorbed the operating costs for the returning jets including fuel costs which were previously the responsibility of frontier 

  

horizon revenues 

  

in 2007 operating revenues increased 744 million or 116 compared to 2006 horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the table below 

  

   

horizon’s systemwide operating revenues per asm increased by 19 from 2006 the increase was largely due to the shift in capacity out of frontier jetexpress flying which produced relatively low rasm because of the terms of the contract and the longerhaul nature of the flying to higher rasm brand and alaska cpa flying as mentioned earlier the frontier jetexpress operation ceased in november 2007 

  

lineofbusiness information is presented in the table below in both cpa arrangements horizon is insulated from market revenue factors and is guaranteed contractual revenue amounts based on operational capacity as a result yield and load factor information for the cpa arrangements are not presented 

  

  

   

 horizon brand flying includes routes in the horizon system not covered by the alaska cpa horizon has the inventory and revenue risk in these markets passenger revenue from horizon brand flying increased 322 million or 90 on a 196 increase in brand capacity offset by an 88 decline in unit revenues the decline in unit revenues was due to a 24point reduction in load factor along with a 59 decline in yields resulting from increased competition in many of these brand markets and from intentional pricing actions taken in certain markets to fill the additional capacity 

  

revenue from the cpa with alaska totaled 2834 million during 2007 under the cpa the fee paid by alaska is based on horizon’s actual operating costs plus a specified margin under the prior revenuesharing arrangement alaska made a payment to horizon equal to horizon’s loss in those markets if any and a quarterly bonus that was based on alaska’s overall operating margin alternatively horizon made a payment to alaska if those markets were profitable 

  

revenue from the frontier jetexpress flying declined 343 from 525 million in 2006 to 345 million in 2007 on a 381 decline in asms the asm decline is consistent with the winddown of the jetexpress arrangement that occurred throughout 2007 

  

horizon expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 871 million or 138 as compared to 2006 along with our financial and statistical data on page 35 we are presenting here our line item expenses on a perasm basis in cents 

  

   

 significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased 119 million or 63 as a result of a slight increase in fulltime equivalent employees higher wages due to market and step increases and an increase in our group medical costs we expect that wages and benefits will be flat in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel expense increased 223 million or 191 compared to 2006 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

the 193 increase in consumption was driven by the return of all nine crj700s from frontier jetexpress and the introduction of several new q400s into the fleet replacing smaller q200s under the frontier jetexpress arrangement fuel was purchased by frontier we expect to see a yearoveryear increase in the number of gallons consumed in 2008 as we see the full effect of the fleet changes offsetting these increases in fuel consumption is the improved fuel efficiency of our fleet resulting from new q400 aircraft deliveries these more fuelefficient aircraft have helped to improve the overall fuelburn rate per asm by approximately 3 from 2006 

  

the raw fuel price per gallon increased by 10 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by higher crude oil costs 

  

during 2007 we recorded marktomarket gains reflecting an increase in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 in 2006 we recorded a marktomarket loss as oil prices on december 31 2006 were lower than they were a year earlier our hedge portfolio consists primarily of call options that are based on the price of crude oil 

  

we realized gains of 85 million from settled hedge contracts in 2007 compared to 141 million in 2006 our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

like alaska our fuel hedge protection declined substantially in 2007 as the strike price of our hedges was closer to current oil prices compared to those in place during the previous two years the total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined to 85 million in 2007 from 141 million in 2006 and 162 million in 2005 

  

we currently expect economic fuel expense to be higher in 2008 than in 2007 because of high crude oil prices for example if oil were to average 87 per barrel in 2008 we would expect our raw fuel expense to be approximately 272 per gallon and the cash benefit of settled hedges to be approximately 10 million resulting in an economic fuel price per gallon of approximately 259 

  

 aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense increased 181 million or 245 primarily as a result of a higher number of engine events including scheduled events on our crj700 engines we expect maintenance expense in 2008 to be approximately 15 million lower than in 2007 primarily because of fewer crj700 engine events however actual results could differ materially if the maintenance schedule is modified or we are forced to perform unforeseen maintenance activities 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent declined by 37 million or 53 primarily as a result of the reduction in the number of leased q200 aircraft in our operating fleet these leased aircraft were replaced with new owned q400s during the year 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 154 million or 832 as a result of the 13 new q400s that were delivered in 2007 we own all of these new aircraft additionally we recorded higher depreciation expense on q200 rotable and repairable parts since we now intend to phase out those aircraft by the end of 2009 we anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase in 2008 as we take more q400 deliveries throughout the year 

  

fleet transition costs 

  

fleet transition costs associated with the sublease of q200 aircraft were 141 million in 2007 as a result of the 11 q200 aircraft that were delivered to a third party we expect total fleet transition costs to be approximately 8 million during 2008 as five additional q200s leave the fleet and we record losses arising from the subleases 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

as discussed above operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost reduction efforts like alaska’s horizon’s efforts to reduce unit costs over the long term focus not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend but also on increasing available seat miles without adding a commensurate amount of cost we intend to increase capacity in the future primarily through largergauge aircraft as we replace our q200 aircraft with larger q400 aircraft however we expect a reduction of capacity in 2008 as noted previously which puts upward pressure on our unit costs 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 

  

  

   

we currently forecast our costs per asm excluding fuel and the fleet transition costs for the first quarter and full year of 2008 to be up about 1 and flat respectively compared to 2007 

  

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 104 million in 2007 compared to 05 million in 2006 interest income declined by 04 million compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a lower average cash and marketable securities balance partially offset by higher average portfolio returns interest expense increased 100 million because of new debt arrangements in 2006 and 2007 and increases in the average interest rate on our variablerate debt this increase was offset by the conversion to equity of our 150 million senior convertible notes in april 2006 which eliminated further interest expense on those notes othernet increased 26 million and includes a 375 million expense associated with our investment in row 44 given their early 

  

 stage nature capitalized interest increased 31 million from 2006 resulting from an increase in predelivery deposits in connection with our orders for b737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on income loss before income taxes for 2007 was 380 compared to an effective income tax rate of 401 in 2006 the effective rate for 2007 was positively impacted by 21 million in credits resulting from a favorable outcome of the state income tax matters referred to in note 13 excluding this benefit our effective tax rate would have been 390 which is different from our marginal 2007 tax rate of 374 the difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards the 2006 year includes 55 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006 excluding this benefit our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 338 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2006 was 526 million or 139 per share compared to a net loss of 59 million or 001 per diluted share in 2005 

  

both the 2006 and 2005 results include certain significant items that affect the comparability of the years 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we believe disclosure of the impact of these individual charges is useful information to investors and other readers because of the reasons provided above in the “2007 compared with 2006” section 

  

alaska reported a 2006 loss before income taxes of 922 million while horizon reported income before income taxes of 117 million financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 34 and 35 respectively 

  

alaska airlines 

  

alaska reported a loss before income taxes of 922 million during 2006 compared to income before income taxes and accounting change of 1242 million in 2005 the 2164 million difference between the years is primarily the result of the fleet transition and restructuring charges recognized in 2006 totaling 2184 million combined with a significant increase in fuel expenses offset by an 114 increase in operating revenues and a reduction in maintenance costs and aircraft rent 

  

 as purchased capacity activity was not significant in 2006 and 2005 the ensuing discussion will be focused on mainline operations only 

  

alaska mainline revenues 

  

mainline operating revenues increased 2769 million or 115 during 2006 primarily as a result of a 68 increase in operating revenue per available seat mile rasm and a 44 increase in capacity the increase in mainline rasm was driven almost entirely by a 67 increase in ticket yields resulting largely from higher ticket prices the increase in capacity is primarily the result of having a larger aircraft fleet and a longer average stage length in 2006 

  

load factor increased slightly by 07 percentage points to 766 during 2006 

  

freight and mail revenues increased 31 million or 34 compared to 2005 primarily resulting from higher mail and freight yields and fuel surcharges that we added to our freight services beginning in the third quarter of 2005 offset by lower freight volumes revenues from our cargo operations were lower than expected for 2006 due to the delay in the delivery of our modified 737400 cargo aircraft three of the four were originally scheduled for delivery in 2006 but none was actually delivered until 2007 these delays kept the cargo operations from increasing capacity and thereby the volume of cargo shipped 

  

othernet revenues increased only slightly by 37 million or 29 mileage plan revenues were slightly lower than in 2006 primarily as a result of lower commissions recognized for sold miles as yields increased in 2006 the rate at which we defer the revenue related to sold miles increased resulting in a smaller percentage of cash receipts recorded as commission revenue during the period the decline in commission revenue associated with sold miles was partially offset by higher net revenues from award redemption on our partner airlines 

  

alaska airlines mainline expenses 

  

total mainline operating expenses increased 5131 million or 227 as compared to 2005 this increase is largely due to fleet transition costs in 2006 a significant increase in aircraft fuel including hedging gains and losses as we adjust the value of our hedges that will benefit future periods and increases in wages and benefits variable incentive pay contracted services selling expenses depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges offset by a decline in aircraft maintenance and aircraft rent additional line item information is provided below 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased by 212 million or 29 during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily as a result of the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the increase from the prior year was partially offset by the following 

  

   

   

 variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay increased 124 million or 810 over 2005 primarily as a result of a significant improvement in air group’s 2006 profit as defined in the incentive agreements 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel increased 2810 million or 590 in 2006 compared to 2005 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

fuel gallons consumed increased by 23 primarily as a result of the increased capacity and the addition of new aircraft raw fuel cost per gallon increased by 174 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by the sharp increase in average world oil prices 

  

during 2006 we recorded a 784 million marktomarket loss reflecting a decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2005 and december 31 2006 in 2005 we recorded a 531 million marktomarket gain reflecting an increase in the value of the portfolio from the previous year these marktomarket adjustments are largely driven by the closing price of crude oil on the last date of the reporting period and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 

  

the total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined from 1088 million in 2005 to 870 million in 2006 our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance decreased by 284 million or 153 mostly as a result of fewer highdollar engine maintenance events a decline in the number and change in the mix of airframe events lower perevent costs due to renegotiated contracts with our outside vendors and savings from process improvement initiatives 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent decreased by 59 million or 51 primarily as a result of the buyout of five md80 aircraft from leases during the third quarter of 2006 offset by two new b737800 operating leases entered into in the fourth quarter of 2006 

  

landing fees and other rentals 

  

landing fees and other rentals increased slightly by 20 million or 13 as a result of slightly higher airport and security costs specifically at los angeles international airport lax where a retroactive increase to the beginning of 2006 was imposed on certain carriers late in the year 

  

 the increase for alaska was approximately 15 million a large portion of this rate increase and retroactive charge was reversed and returned in 2007 

  

contracted services 

  

contracted services increased 126 million or 120 primarily resulting from the subcontracting of the company’s seattle ramp operations in may 2005 additionally a 47 million navigation fee refund was received in 2005 which reduced our 2005 expenses 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses increased 89 million or 67 primarily as a result of an increase in revenuerelated expenses such as credit card and codeshare commissions in connection with the rise in revenues over the prior period and an increase in incentive payments to horizon for certain flying under the former revenuesharing arrangement 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 124 million or 99 compared to 2005 this increase is primarily due to the delivery of two new owned b737800 aircraft in 2005 and ten new owned b737800 aircraft in 2006 the purchase of five md80 aircraft from lessors during the third quarter of 2006 and the acceleration of depreciation on our owned md80 fleet to reduce the carrying value to estimated realizable value as they come out of the fleet offset by the lower depreciable base on the md80 fleet following the impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2006 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

as discussed above operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our cost reduction efforts our mainline operating costs per mainline asm are summarized below 

  

  

   

horizon air 

  

horizon reported pretax income of 117 million during 2006 compared to income before income taxes and accounting change of 264 million in 2005 the 147 million decrease is primarily due to a 199 increase in operating costs driven primarily by increased fuel and maintenance costs offset by a 157 increase in operating revenues 

  

horizon air revenues 

  

operating revenues increased 876 million or 157 in 2006 compared to 2005 this increase reflects an 84 increase in per unit revenues rasm and a 68 increase in capacity 

  

horizon’s passenger revenues are summarized in the table below 

  

   

 the capacity increase is primarily due to the addition of one crj700 in january 2006 two q400s that began operating in june and august 2006 increased capacity from adding four more seats to our q400s in the third quarter of 2005 and increased flying for frontier revenue and capacity from the frontier contract flying represented approximately 8 of passenger revenues and 23 of capacity in 2006 similar to 2005 

  

the rasm increase from the prioryear period resulted from a 91 rasm increase in our native network flying including “brand” flying and alaska revenue share markets offset by a 14 decline in rasm from the frontier contract flying the frontier decline is a function of a 57 increase in capacity coupled with a fee arrangement based on certain measures that did not correspond to capacity as such the perunit revenues were diluted as more capacity was added passenger load factor increased 13 percentage points to 741 as a result of an increase in demand passenger yield increased 70 to 2353 cents largely benefiting from industrywide fare increases 

  

horizon expenses 

  

operating expenses for 2006 increased 1049 million or 199 compared to 2005 primarily due to increases in aircraft fuel wages and benefits and aircraft maintenance 

  

explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased 156 million or 90 over 2005 reflecting a 45 increase in the average number of fulltime equivalent employees and an increase in wages per employee resulting from market and contract step increases 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay increased 44 million or 936 over 2005 as a result of the same reasons noted above in the alaska discussion 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel increased 436 million or 598 in 2006 compared to 2005 the elements of the change are illustrated in the following table 

  

  

   

fuel gallons consumed increased by 58 primarily as a result of an increase in capacity and block hours raw fuel cost per gallon increased by 153 as a result of higher west coast jet fuel prices driven by the sharp increase in average world oil prices 

  

during 2006 we recorded an 115 million marktomarket loss reflecting a decline in the value of our fuel hedge portfolio between december 31 2005 and december 31 2006 in 2005 we recorded an 86 million marktomarket gain reflecting an increase in the value of the portfolio from the previous year these marktomarket adjustments are largely driven by the closing price of crude oil on the last date of the reporting period and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 

  

the total cash benefit from hedges that settled during the period declined from 162 million in 2005 to 141 million in 2006 our economic fuel expense is calculated as follows 

  

  

   

 aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense increased 306 million or 707 primarily as a result of more scheduled heavy checks and engine overhauls for the q200 and q400 fleets with fewer aircraft covered under warranty 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent declined slightly by 09 million or 13 in 2006 primarily resulting from the annualization of lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased engines 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses increased by 47 million or 111 largely as a result of higher crew expenses and passenger remuneration costs 

  

operating costs per available seat mile casm 

  

as discussed above operating costs per asm casm is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our costreduction efforts like alaska horizon’s efforts to reduce unit costs focus not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend but also on increasing available seat miles without adding a commensurate amount of cost 

  

our operating costs per asm are summarized below 

  

   

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 05 million in 2006 compared to 293 million in 2005 interest income increased 234 million compared to 2005 primarily as a result of higher average portfolio returns and a higher average 

cash and marketable securities balance interest expense increased 150 million primarily resulting from interest rate increases on our variablerate debt new debt arrangements in 2006 and the changes to some of our variablerate debt arrangements to slightly higher fixed rates this increase was offset by the conversion of our 150 million senior convertible notes to equity in april 2006 which eliminated further interest expense on those notes capitalized interest increased 158 million from 89 million in 2005 to 247 million during 2006 this is due to the significant increase in predelivery deposits in connection with our orders for b737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2006 was 401 compared to an effective income tax rate of 384 in 2005 the 2006 year also includes 55 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006 excluding this benefit our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 338 which is different from our marginal 2006 tax rate of 374 the difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards we applied our 2005 marginal rate of 375 to the cumulative effect of the accounting change 

  

change in accounting policy 

  

effective january 1 2005 we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method under the former method these costs were capitalized and amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term under the direct expense method overhaul costs are expensed as incurred we believe that the direct expense method is preferable because it 

  

 eliminates the judgment and estimation needed to determine overhaul versus repair allocations in maintenance activities additionally our approved maintenance program for the majority of our airframes now focuses more on shorter but more frequent maintenance visits we also believe that the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry accordingly effective january 1 2005 we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft resulting in a charge of 1447 million pretax 904 million after tax we do not believe disclosing the effect of adopting the direct expense method on net income for 2005 provides meaningful information because of 

changes in our maintenance program including the execution of a “powerbythehour” engine maintenance agreement with a third party in late 2004 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our many travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our bank partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners as long 

as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties the majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue when the cash is received the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2007 we had approximately 114 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 6485 million both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

  

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles 

  

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as fare levels change our deferral rate changes which may result in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter for example due to the yearoveryear increases in average ticket prices our deferral rate increased in 2007 resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold holding all other assumptions constant an additional 1 increase in the deferral rate would have 

  

 reduced our 2007 commission revenue by approximately 24 million 

  

2 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel breakage 

  

members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel therefore based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts we estimate how many miles will never be used “breakage” and do not record a liability for those miles our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members’ accounts account balances and other factors we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations a hypothetical 10 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 72 million effect on the liability actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates 

  

3 the number of miles used per award ie free ticket 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska horizon or other airlines 

  

4 the number of awards redeemed for travel on alaska or horizon versus other airlines 

  

the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption 

patterns if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

  

5 the costs that will be incurred to provide award travel 

  

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on alaska or horizon incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we review significant mileage plan assumptions each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

pension plans 

  

we account for the definedbenefit pension plans using sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 sfas 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income 

  

 under sfas no 158 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 626 million 783 million and 717 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2007 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 775 this rate was developed 

using historical data as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2007 is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixed income securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 775 to 725 would increase our estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately 45 million 

  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 600 and 575 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 600 to 550 would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2007 by approximately 791 million and increase estimated 2008 pension expense by approximately 94 million 

  

with the exception of the plan covering alaska’s pilots all of our definedbenefit pension plans are closed to new entrants 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 30 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

  

in march 2006 our board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of our md80 fleet 15 owned and 11 leased aircraft at the time and remove those aircraft from service by the end of 2008 which is earlier than the original retirement schedule as a result of this decision we evaluated impairment as required by sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  and concluded that the carrying value of the md80 fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows accordingly during the first quarter of 2006 the company recorded an impairment charge totaling 1311 million to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value additionally during the third quarter of 2006 we bought five md80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft the total purchase price for the five aircraft was 809 million including assumed debt of 116 million immediately upon purchase of the aircraft we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable as a result we recorded an 

  

 additional 584 million charge in the third quarter for the impairment see note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the impairment of the md80s 

  

in 2007 horizon announced plans to phase out its remaining leased q200 aircraft by the end of 2009 and is in the process of evaluating potential arrangements to dispose of those leased aircraft all of these aircraft are leased under operating lease agreements however as a result of this decision we reassessed the depreciable lives and salvage values of the related rotable and repairable q200 parts and as such we have increased the periodic depreciation expense 

  

we are early in the process of evaluating whether further fleet simplification of horizon’s fleet would be beneficial such simplification could involve a move away from the crj700 aircraft to an allq400 fleet no decisions have been made at this time however should we decide to exit the crj700 fleet prior to the end of the lease expiration for those aircraft we would likely revise the useful lives of the related rotable and repairable parts which would result in higher depreciation expense 

  

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft 

  

workers’ compensation and employee healthcare accruals 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for workers’ compensation claims and employee healthcare benefits liabilities associated with these risks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and 

historical trends our workers’ compensation and employee health care accruals totaled 429 million at december 31 2007 compared to 427 million at december 31 2006 

  

new accounting standards 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fairvalue measurements required under other accounting pronouncements sfas 157 does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value the statement is effective for financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and 2008 respectively we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas 157 but do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our results from operations or financial position 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates such election which may be applied on an instrumentbyinstrument basis is typically irrevocable once elected this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and early adoption is allowed under certain circumstances we do not expect this statement to have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations  and sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  these standards were issued jointly and will require most identifiable assets liabilities noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders both statements 

  

 are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 sfas no 141r will be applied only to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and sfas no 160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests including any that arose before the effective date we do not expect these statements to have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2007 our cash and marketable securities declined 1911 million to 8228 million the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the decrease and our expectation of future cash requirements 

  

analysis of our cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was 4820 million compared to 4498 million during 2006 the increase resulted from higher revenues and lower cash contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans in 2007 offset by the 477 million reduction in cash received from settled hedges and higher raw fuel costs and other nonfuel operating expenses we contributed 525 million to our definedbenefit pension plans in 2007 compared to 1219 million in 2006 we typically generate positive cash flows from operations but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash for capital expenditures and debt payments in 2008 and 2009 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

our investing activities are primarily made up of capital expenditures associated with our fleet transition programs and to a lesser extent purchases and sales of marketable securities cash used in investing activities was 6018 million during 2007 compared to 5330 million in 2006 our capital expenditures grew by 1523 million as a result of the purchase of 14 b737800s and 13 q400s versus the purchase of ten b737800s five leased md80s two q400s and one crj700 in 2006 this was partially offset by proceeds of approximately 50 million from the sale of our md80s which were subsequently leased back we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 570 million of which 490 million is expected to be aircraftrelated during 2008 as we take delivery of 16 new b737800s and three new q400s capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2009 and 2010 as we near the end of our committed firm aircraft deliveries we do have a number of options for both b737800 and q400 aircraft available should we decide to convert those into firm commitments however a decision to exercise those options is highly dependent on our ability to deploy those new aircraft profitably and generate returns that exceed our cost of capital 

  

cash provided by financing activities 

  

we finance a large portion of our capital spending with debt financing net cash provided by financing activities was 934 million during 

  

 2007 compared to 2403 million during 2006 we obtained debt financing of 1961 million for six new b737800 aircraft and received 61 million of cash upon the issuance of common stock through stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan additionally we borrowed 858 million using our predelivery payment facility offsetting these cash inflows were normal longterm debt payments of 1322 million and the 628 million repurchase of 26 million shares of our common stock 

  

we plan to meet our significant capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand additional debt financing and availability of credit under our predelivery payment facility we have financing already in place for deliveries of b737800s through 2009 and subsequent to december 31 2007 we closed financing on 13 of our q400s resulting in cash proceeds of 193 million 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

alaska has a 185 million variablerate credit facility that expires in march 2010 as of december 31 2007 there are no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and the company has no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility see note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

predelivery payment facility 

  

alaska’s 172 million variablerate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of the predelivery funding requirements of alaska’s purchase of new boeing 737800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement the maximum available amount is reduced to 152 million beginning in august 2009 the facility expires on august 31 2011 the interest rate is 

based on onemonth libor plus a specified margin any borrowings will be secured by alaska’s rights under the boeing purchase agreement the principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid at the time that alaska takes delivery of the aircraft if not sooner as of december 31 2007 858 million was outstanding 

  

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

at december 31 2007 we had firm orders to purchase 46 aircraft requiring future aggregate payments of approximately 10 billion as set forth below alaska also has committed to delivery of one new b737800 aircraft in 2008 under an operating lease arrangement alaska has options to acquire 45 additional b737s and horizon has options to acquire 20 q400s alaska and horizon expect to finance the firm orders and to the extent exercised the option aircraft with leases longterm debt or internally generated cash 

  

during 2007 alaska took delivery of 14 b737800s all of which were paid for with cash on hand six were subsequently financed with fixed and variablerate debt arrangements horizon took delivery of 13 q400s all of which were paid for with cash on hand during 2007 alaska sold and leased back 20 md80 aircraft 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year as of december 31 2007 

  

   

 two of the b737800 aircraft were delivered subsequent to december 31 2007 but before the filing of this form 10k the two b737800 were paid for with cash on hand the remaining b737800 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2008 are generally evenly spread throughout the rest of the year although weighted more toward the last six months of the year in addition to the 16 purchased aircraft above alaska has committed to an operating lease arrangement with a third party for one b737800 to be delivered in march 2008 the three q400s will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2008 financing for ten of the 2008 b737800 deliveries has already been arranged we expect to pay for the remaining deliveries with cash on hand in january 2008 we obtained financing for 13 of the recently delivered q400 aircraft resulting in net proceeds from borrowings of 193 million 

  

our agreements with boeing and bombardier provide us with flexibility to adjust aircraft deliveries in the future should we wish to accelerate or slow our growth 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2007 this table excludes contributions to our various pension plans which we expect to be approximately 50 million to 75 million per year through 2012 

  

  

     

effect of inflation and price changes 

  

inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income 

  

other 

  

we strive to provide a return to our investors that exceeds the cost of the capital employed in our business our targeted return on invested capital roic is 10 we have not historically reached this threshold nor did we in 2007 however our strategic plan is built on the premise of providing an appropriate return to all capital providers

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   

we have interestrate risk on our floatingrate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

market risk – aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists almost exclusively of crude oil call options we utilize the contracts in our portfolio as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of fuel prices allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing fuel prices with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts although to a lesser extent we also use collar structures for fuel hedging purposes we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2007 would increase or decrease the fair value of our hedge portfolio by approximately 354 million and 334 million respectively 

  

additionally we have entered into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay for approximately 50 of our fuel consumption in the first quarter of 2008 

  

our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth 1125 million at december 31 2007 including 309 million of capitalized premiums paid to counterparties compared to a portfolio value of 686 million at december 31 2006 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions for more discussion see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

financial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variable rate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2007 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 28 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements in 2005 and 2006 additionally several of our new debt arrangements in 2006 and 2007 were fixedrate arrangements and we converted our variablerate 150 million senior notes to equity in 2006 we continue to enter into both variablerate and fixedrate arrangements in order to diversify our loan portfolio so that we mitigate risk of severe market fluctuations our variablerate debt is approximately 40 of our total longterm debt at december 31 2007 compared to 37 at december 31 2006 subsequent to december 31 2007 and through february 15 2007 we have converted approximately 30 million of our variablerate debt arrangements into fixedrate arrangements and we intend to convert more in the future 

  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2007 interest income would increase by approximately 92 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

as of december 31 2007 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer collectively our “certifying officers” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures these disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our current and periodic reports filed with or submitted to the securities and exchange commission the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our certifying officers on a timely basis our certifying officers concluded based on their evaluation that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2007 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

during 2007 alaska and horizon converted to an integrated human resources benefits and payroll system prior to the conversion the companies operated on separate systems there were no changes to the company’s internal control over financial reporting including the changes described above identified in management’s evaluation during the year ended december 31 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso framework based on our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2007 

  

we intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our controls and procedures 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 which report appears on page 99

alaska air group inc 

  

we have audited alaska air group inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso alaska air group inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion alaska air group inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of alaska air group inc as of december 31 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2007 and our report dated february 19 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

 other information 

  

seasonality and other factors 

  

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operating income is generally lowest or if it be the case our loss the greatest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic generally increases in the second quarter and typically reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska 

  

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition to those factors listed above seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures such as maintenance events and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

  

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers consequently the loss of one or more of even our largest customers would likely not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

insurance 

  

we carry insurance for passenger liability and property and aircraft damage in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice 

  

after september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage for thirdparty liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time the insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general since then however our insurance rates have been declining during 2006 and 2007 our insurance rates fell below 2001 levels we attribute this decline to general rate reductions as well as the extensive safety programs maintained by both of our airlines 

  

pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 as amended by the consolidated appropriations act 2008 the us government has offered and we have accepted war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august 31 2008 

  

other government matters 

  

we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military callup the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft participation in the program is a prerequisite for bidding on various governmental travel contracts

general information 

  

alaska air group inc is a delaware holding company incorporated in 1985 with two principal subsidiaries alaska airlines inc alaska and horizon air industries inc horizon both subsidiaries operate as airlines although their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska is a major airline that operates an alljet fleet with an average passenger trip length of 1038 miles horizon is a regional airline operates turboprop and jet aircraft and its average passenger trip is 392 miles individual financial information for alaska and horizon is reported in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

air group’s corporate offices are located at 19300 international boulevard seattle washington 98188 our filings with the securities and exchange commission including our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge at wwwalaskaaircom the information contained on our website is not a part of this annual report on form 10k 

  

both of our airlines endeavor to distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer service and differentiating amenities our outstanding employees and excellent service in the form of advance seat assignments expedited checkin attention to customer needs a generous frequent flyer program wellmaintained aircraft a firstclass section aboard alaska aircraft and other amenities are regularly recognized by independent studies awards and surveys of air travelers for example horizon was recently named the “2007 regional airline of the year” by air transport world a leading industry publication 

  

alaska 

  

alaska airlines is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 we principally serve destinations in the state of alaska and through our northsouth service between cities in the western us canada and mexico alaska also provides eastwest service to eight cities primarily from seattle where we have our largest concentration of departures although we do have some transcontinental departures from anchorage and los angeles and beginning in september 2007 from portland or in 2006 we carried 172 million revenue passengers and in each year since 1973 we have carried more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline based on passenger enplanements alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles anchorage and portland based on 2006 revenues the leading nonstop routes are anchorageseattle los angelesseattle and san diegoseattle at december 31 2006 alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 114 jet aircraft slightly more than the 110 aircraft as of december 31 2005 

  

passenger traffic by market is presented below 

  

   

horizon 

  

horizon a washington corporation that first began service in 1981 was incorporated in 1982 and was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves 40 cities in 

  

seven states and six cities in canada under the horizon brand in addition to operating under the horizon brand horizon operates regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress in an agreement with frontier airlines during 2006 horizon operated nine 70seat bombardier crj700 aircraft under the frontier jetexpress brand representing approximately 23 of total horizon capacity and approximately 8 of total horizon revenue in 2006 however in the third quarter of 2006 horizon announced that it would be terminating the agreement with frontier and will take back the nine crj700s beginning in january 2007 and will redeploy those aircraft into the air group route structure 

  

in 2006 horizon carried 69 million revenue passengers approximately 91 of horizon’s revenue passenger miles in 2006 were flown domestically primarily in the states of washington oregon and idaho compared to 95 in 2005 the canada markets accounted for 9 of revenue passenger miles in 2006 compared to 5 in 2005 based on passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland boise and spokane based on revenues in 2006 the leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and ontarioportland at december 31 2006 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 21 jets and 48 turboprop aircraft except for those flights operating as frontier jetexpress horizon flights are listed under the alaska airlines designator code in airline reservation systems 

  

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide convenient competitive connections between most points served by their systems in both 2006 and 2005 approximately 24 of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska 

  

industry conditions 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and is characterized by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership costs and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current events and industry capacity 

  

in 2006 the industry as a whole experienced its best financial year since 2000 and is currently expected by industry experts and analysts to post a net profit in 2007 in the past two years load factors and unit revenues climbed higher in the wake of strong demand and a healthy economy the strong demand and a reduction in total capacity in some regions have allowed domestic carriers to raise ticket prices airlines including alaska and horizon have raised ticket prices to help recapture the significant increase in the price of jet fuel particularly since early 2005 the industry’s financial results have also benefited from massive reductions in nonfuel operating costs either through bankruptcy proceedings or other costreduction efforts 

  

delta airlines and northwest airlines are currently operating under bankruptcy protection and are expected to emerge sometime in 2007 at which time their unit costs are likely to be among the lowest of the “legacy carriers” under bankruptcy reorganization carriers gain a competitive advantage by significantly reducing their costs almost immediately in addition so called “lowcost carriers” lccs have grown significantly since 2001 and currently carry more than 30 of total us domestic passenger traffic however the line between the lccs and traditional or legacy carriers is becoming more blurred as legacy carriers make further reductions in unit costs and the lccs face cost pressures because of their unit cost advantage the lccs and recently reorganized airlines have and continue to exert downward pressure on ticket prices compared to historical levels because of the relatively low barriers to entry and financial success of lccs we expect the expansion of lowcost and lowfare carriers to continue we compete with many of these carriers now and expect to compete with new entrants in the future 

  

recently there has been speculation concerning potential consolidation in the airline industry in late 2006 us airways group announced a bid for delta united and continental were rumored to be discussing a merger 

  

and airtran announced a takeover bid for midwest airlines although us airways’ bid for delta has been withdrawn and midwest rejected airtran’s offer talk of industry consolidation continues 

  

most major us carriers including alaska continue to be focused on reducing operating costs labor costs generally make up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups who are covered by collective bargaining agreements often airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition although alaska was able to reduce our wages and benefits costs in 2005 as a result of a number of factors including a reduction in alaska’s pilot wages that took effect in may 2005 and subcontracting alaska’s seattle ramp services total wages and benefits increased in 2006 horizon faces similar pressures on wages and benefits we expect some continued upward pressure on wages and benefits in the future we recognize the need to continue to improve employee productivity in order to mitigate this cost pressure and to reduce our wages and benefits on an availableseatmile basis we have initiatives underway to increase productivity and efficiency in our processes 

  

historically fuel costs have generally represented 10 to 15 of an airline’s operating costs however in recent years fuel costs have risen sharply to represent 20 to 30 of total operating costs for airlines fuel prices can be volatile and are largely uncontrollable although crude oil prices did fall somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2006 and into early 2007 our average fuel cost per gallon before the benefit of our hedging activities increased 17 34 and 40 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

marketing and competition 

  

alliances with other airlines 

  

we have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges and code sharing on certain flights as set forth below alliances enhance our revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage creditredemption opportunities by giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and by providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation if a significant agreement were terminated it could adversely impact revenues and increase the costs of our other marketing agreements northwest is currently in bankruptcy and although not likely could propose plans of reorganization that would seek to modify or terminate some or all of these agreements 

  

most of our codeshare relationships are freesell codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk the table below identifies our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2006 

  

   

      

competition 

  

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any domestic air carrier that is issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the department of transportation dot and an operating certificate from the federal aviation administration faa is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the united states together alaska and horizon carry approximately 35 of all us domestic passenger traffic alaska and horizon compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes including southwest airlines united airlines northwest airlines continental airlines american airlines delta airlines us airways and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers most of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our companies in addition competitors who successfully reorganize out of bankruptcy will likely have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements some of these competitors have chosen to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets continuing growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airlines airtran airways frontier airlines jetblue airways and the possible emergence of virgin america in the united states places significant competitive pressures on our airlines and other network carriers because the lowcost carriers have the ability to charge a lower fare for travel between similar cities and thus exert downward pressure on ticket prices as such we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes in many markets with ground transportation including train bus and automobile transportation 

  

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

   

our sales by channel is presented below 

  

   

employees 

  

the airline business is highly labor intensive we had 14485 alaska and horizon had 10454 and 4031 respectively active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2006 compared to 13768 9866 at alaska and 3902 at horizon as of december 31 2005 wages salaries and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 28 and 33 of our total operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

at december 31 2006 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 49 of horizon’s employees our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act the collective bargaining agreements between the respective airlines and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to appoint a federal mediator if no agreement is reached in mediation the national mediation board may declare that an impasse exists at which point the national mediation board offers binding arbitration to the parties either party may decline to submit to arbitration if arbitration is rejected by either party a 30day “coolingoff” period commences during that period a presidential emergency board may be established which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution the presidential emergency board process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “coolingoff” period of 30 days at the end of the applicable “coolingoff” period unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “selfhelp” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments on the collective bargaining agreements andor the hiring of workers to replace strikers 

  

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2006 were as follows 

  

    

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2006 were as follows 

  

   

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline deregulation act of 1978 as amended eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation however the department of transportation dot and the federal aviation administration faa still exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us a certificate is of unlimited duration but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificate itself in addition the dot maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements alliance agreements between domestic major airlines international route authorities and certain consumer protection matters such as advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability international treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the us 

  

the faa through the promulgation of the federal aviation regulations fars generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrieroperating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved both our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate the maintenance program provides for the ongoing 

  

maintenance of such aircraft ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls from time to time the faa issues airworthiness directives ads that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations all airlines including alaska and horizon are subject to routine enforcement actions from time to time brought by the faa for alleged violations of the requirements of the fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

  

the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  

the aviation and transportation security act the security act generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures pursuant to the security act the transportation security administration tsa is responsible for aviation security the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of passengers and property including us mail cargo carryon and checked baggage and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft the tsa performs most of these functions with its own federal employees the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights 

  

the security act imposes a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures in addition carriers are required to pay an additional amount to the tsa to cover the cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 we paid 126 million to tsa for this security charge in 2006 2005 and 2004 in january 2006 the tsa notified air carriers of an increased assessment for the cost of security the industry has opposed and disagrees with the higher assessment and is working with the tsa on a resolution the additional assessment for us was not material 

  

airline fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the dot maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve although air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration known as osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency or epa osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements we maintain our own continuing safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

  

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews the airport noise and capacity act generally requires faa approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft we have had and believe we will continue to have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

at december 31 2006 all of our aircraft met the stage 3 noise requirements under the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 however special noise ordinances restrict the timing of flights operated by alaska horizon and other airlines at burbank long beach orange county san diego san jose and sun valley in addition due to capacity restrictions orange county reagan national long beach chicago o’hare and vancouver bc airports restrict the type of aircraft number of flights or the time of day that airlines can operate 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

  

customer service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service commitment plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds 

  

fuel 

  

our operations are significantly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel costs including hedging activity were approximately 27 of our total operating expenses excluding fleet transition costs restructuring charges and the 2005 navigation fee refund in 2006 20 in 2005 and 17 in 2004 we refer to the price at the airport or “intoplane” price as the “raw” fuel price raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs which can vary by region in the us generally west coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and substantially more volatile than prices in the gulf coast or on the east coast putting both alaska and horizon at a competitive disadvantage both crude and refining costs are volatile and outside of our control and can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results currently a onecent change in the economic fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 40 million we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices 

  

we almost exclusively use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options are intended to effectively cap our pricing on the crude oil component of fuel prices limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums we pay to enter into the contracts we also use collar structures in limited instances for fuel hedging purposes additionally we enter into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay on a certain percentage of our fuel consumption 

  

due to the competitive nature of the airline industry airlines often have been unable to immediately pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares conversely any potential benefit of lower fuel prices could be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues nevertheless because of rising fuel prices over the last few years our fuelhedging program has benefited us with significant savings see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a further discussion of our fuel hedging activities 

  

although we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in jet fuel availability dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production 

  

transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oilproducing areas there could be reductions in the production andor importation of crude oil and resulting price increases which could adversely affect our business if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel our business would be adversely affected 

  

mileage plan program 

  

all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner a grocery store chain a telephone company hotels car rental agencies and other businesses alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or to terminate the program 

  

mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for various other awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to capacitycontrolled seating mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity in a member’s account as of december 31 2006 and 2005 alaska estimated that approximately 32 million and 30 million respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20000mile free roundtrip domestic ticket award threshold of those eligible awards alaska estimated that approximately 88 of those awards would ultimately be redeemed for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 850000 750000 and 631000 roundtrip flight awards respectively were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 97 79 and 73 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 252600 239900 and 212000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 

  

for miles earned through travel on alaska or horizon and their airline partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards in the future is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost of providing award travel on alaska or horizon does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to its nonairline partners alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes revenue when award transportation is provided on alaska or another partner airline at december 31 2006 and 2005 the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 5456 million and 4717 million respectively the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits revenue attributable to the mileage plan was 1942 million 1802 million and 1431 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

other information 

  

seasonality and other factors 

  

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operating income is generally lowest or if it be the case our loss the greatest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic generally increases in the second quarter and typically reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska 

  

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and adverse weather conditions may affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

  

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers consequently the loss of one or more of even our largest customers would likely not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

insurance 

  

we carry insurance for passenger liability and property and aircraft damage in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice 

  

after september 11 2001 aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage for thirdparty liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time the insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general since then however our insurance rates have been declining and during 2006 we were able to renegotiate our insurance rates down to pre2001 levels in 2007 we expect a further decrease in insurance costs as we annualize reductions achieved in late 2006 

  

pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 as amended by the consolidated appropriations act 2005 the us government has offered and we have accepted war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through september 30 2007 

  

other government matters 

  

we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military callup the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline these risk factors may not be exhaustive we operate in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any of such new risk factors on our business or events described in any forwardlooking statements 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the nature of competition in our markets changes 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares flight frequency frequent flyer benefits routes and service the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats recently airlines have reduced routes and the number of planes available which has resulted in reduced industry capacity and a trend towards increased fares if airlines decide to increase their capacity in the future this could cause fares to decline which may adversely 

  

affect our business and results of operations many of our competitors are larger than our airlines and therefore may have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than we do in addition competitors who successfully reorganize out of bankruptcy could have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements in the past some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service reduce their fares or take other such competitive steps in our key markets we may be unable to compete effectively against such other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 

  

the airline industry and particularly regional airlines like horizon also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives such as buses trains or automobiles 

  

the us and mexico recently amended their bilateral agreement relating to commercial air service the amendments expand authorized service levels to cities we serve in mexico other airlines will likely seek to add service to some of the city pairs we currently serve which will increase competition and potentially negatively affect our results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices and variability of jet fuel further increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses accounting for 26 and 20 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively significant increases in fuel costs during the past several years have negatively affected our results of operations further increases would harm our financial condition and results of operations based on historical trends we estimate that a onecent increase in our economic price per gallon of fuel increases our fuel expenses by approximately 40 million annually 

  

historically fuel costs and availability have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand we have not generally been able to increase fares to offset increases in the price of fuel until recently and we may not be able to do so in the future 

  

we utilize fuel hedges as a form of insurance against the volatility of fuel prices to manage the risk of fuel price increases we purchase call options that are designed to cap a portion of our fuel costs at designated perbarrel oil prices even with hedges we are substantially and increasingly exposed to increases in jet fuel costs as the amount of fuel consumption we have hedged declines and the price at which we are hedged increases 

  

a significant increase in labor costs or change in key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business in such case our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

  

labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses accounting for approximately 27 and 32 of our total operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 respectively as of december 31 2006 labor unions represented approximately 84 of alaska’s and 49 of horizon’s employees each of our represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement and could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance uncertainty around open contracts could be a distraction to many employees reduce employee engagement in our business and divert management’s attention from other projects disengaged employees could prevent us from achieving the operational improvements in completion rate and ontime performance that we seek 

  

in 2005 alaska and the air line pilots association alpa were unable to reach a new agreement and therefore pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that existed at the time the parties submitted the agreement to binding arbitration that arbitration decision which was effective may 1 2005 resulted in an average pilot wage reduction of 26 that contract is amendable on may 1 2007 although we are already in negotiations with alpa horizon is also in negotiations with the international brotherhood of teamsters on a new pilot agreement the horizon pilot contract became amendable in september 2006 factoring in pay rates productivity measures and pension and postretirement medical benefits we believe our pilot unit costs at both alaska and horizon are among the highest in the industry for the size of aircraft operated 

  

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional definedbenefit pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace this is because some of our competitors either have eliminated such obligations through bankruptcy or have never had traditional pension plans in place currently all of our definedbenefit pension plans are closed to new entrants with the exception of the plan covering alaska’s pilots 

  

finally to the extent we are unable to maintain the outsourcing or subcontracting of certain services for our business we would incur substantial costs including costs associated with hiring new employees in order to perform these services inhouse 

  

alaska is transitioning to a single fleet this transition may be more costly than we expect or we may not realize the savings we hope to achieve 

  

in 2006 alaska announced a transition to an allboeing 737 fleet as part of this transition we accelerated the retirement of our md80 fleet so that these aircraft will be out of our operating fleet by the end of 2008 

  

we recorded an impairment charge on our owned md80s in 2006 to write the assets down to their estimated fair market value additionally we bought five of our leased md80s from the lessors resulting in further impairment charges we likely will incur additional similar charges in the future related to four of our remaining leased md80 aircraft as we expect to cease operations of those aircraft earlier than their respective lease termination dates we also may have to recognize additional charges upon the sale of any of our md80 aircraft if the proceeds from any sale are less than the carrying value of the aircraft these charges would negatively affect our financial performance the market value of md80 aircraft fluctuates and is highly dependent on factors beyond our control including the number of aircraft available in the market fleet changes by other airlines and demand for those aircraft by other carriers if we are unable to sell our owned md80s or return or sublease the leased aircraft we would also incur storage charges 

  

in addition to the gains or losses that may result on the final disposal of these aircraft our savings from a single fleet type may not be as large as we expect if we are unable to remove all of the structural costs that support multiple fleet types across our operation 

  

our failure to successfully implement alaska’s growth strategy and related costreduction goals could harm our business 

  

alaska’s growth strategy involves operating additional boeing 737800 aircraft increasing the frequency of flights to markets we currently serve expanding into new markets and increasing flight connection opportunities it is critical that we achieve our growth strategy in order for our business to attain economies of scale and to sustain or improve our results of operations if we are unable to hire and retain skilled personnel or to secure the required equipment and facilities or if we are not able to otherwise successfully implement our growth strategy our business and operations could be adversely affected 

  

we continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be 

  

able to fund our growth strategy and take advantage of market opportunities if we are unable to further reduce our nonfuel unit costs we likely likely not be able to achieve our growth plan and our financial results therefore may suffer 

  

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities 

  

we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings as of both december 31 2006 and 2005 we had approximately 12 billion and 11 billion of indebtedness outstanding respectively approximately 11 billion and 859 million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property in addition to longterm debt we have significant other fixed obligations under operating leases related to our aircraft airport terminal space other airport facilities and office space as of december 31 2006 future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately 11 billion for 2007 through 2011 and an aggregate of 6806 million for the years thereafter 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had commitments totaling 12 billion to purchase 51 additional aircraft through 2011 although we have secured financing for a number of these commitments there is no guarantee that additional financing will be available when required our inability to secure the financing could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances or result in delays in or our inability to take delivery of aircraft which would impair our growth or fleetsimplification plans 

  

our outstanding indebtedness and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

   

   

   

we cannot ensure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements we cannot be certain now that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 

  

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including changing economic and other conditions which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations often are affected by changes in economic and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

delays and cancellations frustrate passengers reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs all of which affect our profitability due to our geographic area of operations we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than that of many of our competitors any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub in 2006 traffic to and from seattle accounted for 63 of our total traffic 

  

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs 

  

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath have negatively affected the airline industry including our company more recently the foiled terror plot in the united kingdom in august 2006 resulted in new security measures that also impacted our company additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

immediately following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the insurance coverage available to airlines for thirdparty claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events to 50 million per event and in the aggregate in light of this development under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act and the homeland security act of 2002 as most recently amended by the consolidated appropriations act of 2006 the us government continues to offer domestic airlines either i thirdparty liability war risk coverage above 50 million or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance full hull comprehensive and thirdparty liability war risk coverage this coverage provides for the same limits of war and allied perils coverage for hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of thirdparty liability insurance carried by the airline on september 11 2001 

  

although in 2006 our insurance costs have decreased to pre2001 levels aviation insurers could increase their premiums again in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull comprehensive and thirdparty war risk insurance provided by the government is currently mandated through september 30 2007 although the government may extend the deadline for providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does for how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and shorter cancellation periods ie 7 days or in the case of certain events a lesser period including immediate termination significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations or on the airports at which we operate could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us department of transportation the transportation security administration and the federal aviation administration the “faa” have issued regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures for example the faa has issued regulations covering among other things security measures collision avoidance systems noise abatement environmental restrictions safety procedures and maintenance regulations similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment 

  

because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel although law makers may impose these additional fees and view them as “passthrough” costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

  

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public in addition we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service although we strive to maintain the highest standards of safety and reliability and believe that should an accident or incident nevertheless occur we also currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice however the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

  

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure of these systems or by their operators could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our computerized airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems and other systems substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work 

  

efficiently our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs disruption in changes to or a breach of these systems could result in the loss of important data increase our expenses and possibly cause us to temporarily cease our operations 

  

we rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners” including but not limited to american airlines continental airlines delta airlines and northwest airlines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under codeshare arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage in september 2005 both northwest and delta filed for protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and both plan to exit sometime in 2007 although delta has already filed a reorganization plan that does not include termination of our codeshare arrangement northwest could propose a plan of reorganization that would seek to modify or terminate some or all of these agreements 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our cost reduction efforts our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future in recent years alaska has subcontracted its heavy aircraft maintenance fleet service facilities maintenance and ground handling services at certain airports including seattletacoma international airport to outside vendors 

  

our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all although we believe that our vendor oversight and quality control is among the best in the industry if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline in late 2005 and early 2006 alaska experienced a number of negative press reports following several aircraft incidents in seattle the company has taken steps to increase supervision and training of vendor personnel in order to reduce the risk of further incidents and negative publicity vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

  

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircrafts and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft carriers that operate a more diversified fleet are better positioned than we are to manage such events 

  

we may not be able to redeploy aircraft returning from frontier jetexpress operations in a timely manner which could negatively impact our financial performance 

  

horizon operates regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress with frontier airlines that began in january 2004 but that is currently in the process of being discontinued nine crj700 aircraft will be returned to horizon’s operating fleet in 2007 in 2006 this service represented approximately 23 of horizon’s total capacity and approximately 8 of horizon’s passenger revenue if we are unable to redeploy the capacity from these aircraft into our system we could lose associated revenues thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and financial performance

the following tables describe the aircraft we operate and their average age at december 31 2006 

  

    

part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” discusses future orders and options for additional aircraft 

  

as of december 31 2006 42 of the 70 aircraft owned by alaska and five of the seven aircraft owned by horizon are subject to liens securing longterm debt and the majority of the other owned alaska aircraft serve as collateral for our 160 million lineofcredit facility alaska’s leased 737400 737700 737800 and md80 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2007 and 2016 between 2007 and 2010 between 2015 and 2018 and between 2007 and 2012 respectively horizon’s leased q200 q400 and crj700 aircraft have expiration dates between 2012 and 2014 between 2018 and 2019 and between 2007 and 2020 respectively alaska and horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the thenfairmarket value of the aircraft 

  

  

in 2006 alaska announced a plan to transition to an allboeing 737 fleet by the end of 2008 which includes the accelerated retirement of our md80 fleet giving consideration to this fleet transition plan the following table displays the currently anticipated fleet counts for alaska and horizon as of the end of each quarter on 2007 and as of december 31 2008 

  

     

although the number of aircraft in our operating fleet at the end of each period presented remains relatively consistent it is important to note that the larger b737800s and the q400s are replacing the smaller gauge md80s and q200s therefore our total available capacity will increase even though the number of aircraft remain consistent 

  

ground facilities and services 

  

alaska and horizon lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve alaska also owns terminal buildings in various cities in the state of alaska 

  

alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near seattletacoma international airport seatac in seattle washington these include a fivebay hangar and shops complex used primarily for line maintenance a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an information technology office and mainframe computer facility two office buildings and corporate headquarters complex alaska also leases a stores warehouse and office spaces for a reservation facility and for various administrative functions in kent wa alaska’s major facilities outside of seattle include a regional headquarters building an air cargo facility and a hangaroffice facility in anchorage as well as leased reservations facilities in phoenix az and boise id 

  

horizon owns its seattle corporate headquarters building it leases an operations training and aircraft maintenance facility in portland and maintenance facilities in boise pasco seattle and spokane alaska uses its own employees for ground handling services at airports in the state of alaska at other airports throughout our system those services are contracted to various thirdparty vendors

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

in march 2005 alaska filed a lawsuit in federal district court in seattle against the international association of machinists iam seeking to compel arbitration of a dispute regarding the permissibility under the collective 

  

bargaining agreement of subcontracting alaska’s ramp service operation in seattle on may 10 2005 the iam filed a counter claim against alaska alleging that alaska violated the railway labor act status quo and engaged in bad faith bargaining by among other things stating that it would subcontract the seattle ramp work if it could not reach agreement with the iam on an acceptable new labor contract on may 13 2005 alaska subcontracted the ramp service operation in seattle resulting in the immediate reduction of approximately 475 employees represented by the iam alaska filed a motion to dismiss the iam counterclaim 

  

in april 2006 the federal district court in seattle granted voluntary dismissal of alaska’s lawsuit against the international association of machinists iam seeking to compel arbitration of dispute regarding the permissibility of subcontracting of alaska’s ramp service operation in seattle at the same time the court also dismissed a counterclaim by the iam alleging that alaska violated the railway labor act status quo and engaged in bad faith bargaining the appeal period has expired and these matters are closed 

  

additionally the iam filed a grievance against alaska alleging that alaska violated the collective bargaining agreement by among other things subcontracting the ramp service operation in seattle when the parties could not reach agreement on an acceptable labor contract arbitration for this matter commenced in january 2007 and is scheduled to resume in april 2007 

  

despite more than a year of negotiations to reach a mutual agreement in december 2006 we were notified by the city of los angeles that terminal charges related to our operations at los angeles international airport lax would be unilaterally increased dramatically for 2007 and beyond additionally maintenance and operations fees were increased retroactively to january 2006 these increases were made applicable for all airlines operating in terminals 1 and 3 at lax but were not imposed on airlines operating in terminals 2 and 4 through 8 because of their longterm leases currently in effect we along with other airlines in terminals 1 and 3 have filed a complaint with the department of transportation dot alleging that these disparate changes of such great amounts and the long duration of such changes constitute unreasonable discrimination under federal statutes and dot and faa policies by statue this question will be resolved by the us secretary of transportation early in the summer of 2007 an adverse decision by the secretary could be appealed to the federal circuit court in washington dc 

  

in addition to the cases noted above we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 

  

management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to materially affect our financial position or results of operations this forwardlooking statement is based on management’s current understanding of the relevant law and facts it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand the company our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes this overview summarizes the mda which includes the following sections 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our business 

  

alaska and horizon operate as airlines in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry however their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska is a major airline and principally serves destinations in the state of alaska and provides northsouth service between cities in the western us canada and mexico alaska also provides eastwest service to eight cities primarily from seattle it operates an alljet fleet and its average passenger trip in 2006 was 1038 miles horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest northern california and western canada it operates both jet and turboprop aircraft and its average passenger trip in 2006 was 392 miles both airlines’ outstanding employees and excellent service are regularly recognized by independent studies awards and surveys of air travelers 

  

our goal is to use our people our awardwinning customer service and our strong financial position to become more competitive and gain market share in our primary markets specifically in and from the pacific northwest in doing so we strive to grow in such a way that creates value for our three most important stakeholders – employees customers and shareholders 

  

year in review 

  

although we reported a net loss in 2006 this year was a very successful year for the company in many respects we saw strong 12 revenue growth in 2006 benefiting from industrywide fare increases growth in passenger traffic and record load factors for the full year 

  

operating expenses were up significantly from 2005 primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

excluding fuel the fleet transition costs the restructuring charges and a 2005 navigation fee refund operating costs were 23339 million in 2006 an increase of 897 million over 2005 this increase was well outpaced by the improvement in revenue for the year unit cost per available seat mile at alaska excluding fuel fleet transition costs restructuring charges and the navigation fee refund in 2005 declined from 801 cents per asm in 2005 to 781 cents in 2006 horizon’s unit costs excluding fuel however increased by 63 primarily due to a 707 increase in maintenance costs as many of the q400 aircraft began to come off the warranty period we believe looking at unit costs per available seat mile excluding fuel and other noted items is useful because it helps us assess structural costs and our competitiveness and is a measure commonly used by management at other airlines and by industry watchers 

  

accomplishments 

  

accomplishments from 2006 include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

fleet transition 

  

during the first quarter of this year we announced our plan to retire our entire md80 fleet by the end of 2008 as part of alaska’s move to an allboeing 737 fleet we believe this transition when completed will provide more than 130 million in annual operating savings by way of lower fuel maintenance and training costs as a result of this decision we recognized an impairment charge of 1311 million 820 million after tax during the first quarter related to 15 owned md80 aircraft at that time we also estimated that we would have significant additional charges resulting from any actions taken on our 11 leased md80 aircraft during the third quarter we realized a portion of that expected charge as we purchased five of the leased md80s from the lessors for cash of 693 million and assumed debt of 116 million immediately upon purchase of the aircraft we evaluated the aircraft for impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable therefore we recorded a 584 million charge 365 million after tax in the third quarter including the impairment and the writeoff of 18 million of leasehold improvements related to those aircraft the charge was offset by the reduction of 75 million of deferred rent associated with the acquired aircraft 

  

we are in the process of receiving and reviewing bids from and negotiating with potential buyers for all or a portion of our 20 owned md80s although we are uncertain as to the sales price or timing of any future sale 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had six leased md80s one of those aircraft was decommissioned in december 2006 and one in january 2007 and both were returned to the lessor in january 2007 we expect to cease operation of the remaining four leased aircraft prior to their lease expiration dates which will likely result 

  

in a charge in our consolidated statements of operations we anticipate that once the aircraft have been removed from operation we will dispose of the aircraft through lease buyouts lease agreement restructuring subleasing of the aircraft or storing the aircraft at a longterm storage facility 

  

in 2006 we entered into a purchaseandsale agreement to sell six b737200 aircraft to a third party our seventh and remaining b737200 aircraft will be donated to an aviation museum in alaska the six aircraft will be sold and delivered at various intervals through april 2007 two of the six aircraft were transferred to the buyer during the year and there were nominal gains on the sales 

  

during the third quarter horizon signed a letter of intent with another carrier to sublease up to 16 of its bombardier q200 aircraft each aircraft will be subject to a separate sublease agreement and will leave horizon’s operating fleet beginning in january 2007 through mid2008 it is expected that the sublease will result in a loss for horizon approximating the difference between the lease payments and the sublease receipts the loss on each aircraft will be recorded when the specific aircraft leave horizon’s fleet and the sublease arrangement begins the first of the q200s were transferred to the sublessee in january 2007 resulting in a sublease loss and other related exit costs of approximately 2 million we expect the charge to be approximately 15 million to 2 million on each of the 16 aircraft 

  

labor costs and negotiations 

  

we reached new fouryear agreements with alaska’s flight attendants clerical office and passenger service personnel and ramp service agents and store clerks in 2006 as further described below 

  

   

   

we are pleased with the longterm contracts that have been reached with the majority of our labor groups we are now in the process of negotiating new contracts with pilots at both alaska and horizon the contract with alaska’s pilots becomes amendable may 1 2007 and the contract with horizon’s pilots became amendable september 12 2006 we do not know what the final outcome of these negotiations will be however at the present time none of the contract negotiations is at an impasse or has reached the 30day cooling off period required under the railway labor act that would trigger selfhelp therefore we currently believe the risk of a work stoppage is low 

  

in relation to the two severance packages noted above and prior restructuring efforts the following table displays the activity and balance of the severance and related cost accruals as of and for the year ended december 31 2006  in millions 

  

   

marktomarket fuel hedging gains and losses 

  

we currently do not use hedge accounting for our fuelhedging portfolio as a result our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market value each period through earnings even though the actual consumption and related cash settlement will take place in a future period 

  

historically we reported these gains and losses in other nonoperating income and expense beginning in the first quarter of 2006 however we report these gains and losses in aircraft fuel expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the currentyear format see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

because of the sharp rise in jet fuel prices in 2005 the value of our fuel hedge contracts increased significantly resulting in a large marktomarket gain and a resulting reduction in our fuel expense as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in 2006 fuel prices remained high for most of the year resulting in nominal marketbased changes to the value of our portfolio however the aggregate value of our hedge portfolio declined significantly as many of our inthemoney hedges settled during the period our portfolio of fuel hedge contracts was worth 686 million at december 31 2006 including the value of capitalized premiums paid to counterparties compared to 1533 million at december 31 2005 the vast majority of the contracts in our portfolio are call options which effectively cap the crude oil price component of our fuel consumption while they limit our exposure when oil prices increase these types of contracts also allow us to benefit from a reduction in oil prices 

  

management uses three measures of fuel expense as more fully described below 

  

   

   

in 2006 and 2005 air group recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling 1011 million and 1250 million respectively based on current oil prices and because our hedge positions have higher strike prices than those that existed in 2006 we expect that gains from settled hedges will be significantly lower in the future than they have been for the last two years we believe that we have been and will continue to be among the besthedged airlines in the industry and this measure helps us compare our costs to those of our competitors 

  

   

   

we have provided information about our economic fuel expense and pergallon costs on pages 31 and 32 for more discussion see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices we began entering into hedge contracts again in the third quarter of 2006 after several quarters of no activity we expect to continue to enter into these types of contracts prospectively although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions 

  

frontier jetexpress 

  

in the third quarter of 2006 we announced that horizon would discontinue its contract flying with frontier airlines as frontier jetexpress we have nine crj700 aircraft dedicated to this program all of which will return to horizon’s operating fleet in 2007 two of these were returned in january and the remaining seven are scheduled to come back in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we expect to use these aircraft for productive and strategic redeployments throughout horizon’s network and for harmonization flying with alaska 

  

other events 

  

subsequent to yearend horizon was named “2007 regional airline of the year” by air transport world the publication cited among other positive items an exemplary safety record superior commitment to customer service and positive financial results during challenging industry times 

  

outlook 

  

for 2007 alaska and horizon expect capacity increases of between 40 and 45 and approximately 105 respectively as measured by available seat miles this is compared to an expected domestic capacity increase of 2—3 industrywide the expected capacity increase at alaska is due primarily to the introduction of 14 new b737800 aircraft in 2007 and the annualization of capacity additions that resulted from 12 b737800 aircraft delivered in 2006 offset by the early retirement of several md80 aircraft and scheduled retirement of other aircraft on a net basis we expect that alaska’s fleet size will increase by only two aircraft although the 737800 aircraft are larger than the md80s allowing for the capacity growth mentioned above horizon’s expected capacity increase is due largely to the 13 new q400 aircraft that will be delivered in 2007 and an increase in the number of seats in the existing fleet of q400s from 74 seats to 76 seats offset by the subleasing of 11 q200 aircraft to another carrier the aircraft deliveries in 2007 at both alaska and horizon will be used to replace outgoing aircraft increase frequency in our existing markets and to a lesser degree serve new markets 

  

for much of 2005 and 2006 our operational performance particularly at alaska has fallen short of our goals and our customers’ expectations we currently have several initiatives underway to help improve our ontime performance completion rates baggage handling and other important customerdriven operational measures delivering on these core operational promises is one of our highestpriority internal goals for 2007 

  

results of operations 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2006 was 526 million or 139 per share compared to a net loss of 59 million or 001 per diluted share in 2005 

  

both the 2006 and 2005 results include certain significant items that affect the comparability of the years 

  

   

   

   

   

   

excluding these items and with fuel stated on an economic basis as explained above our consolidated net income would have been 1377 million for 2006 compared to 550 million in 2005 we believe presentation of this nongaap financial measure provides useful information to investors and other readers because 

  

   

   

   

   

financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 28 and 29 respectively on pages 30 through 32 we have included a reconciliation of reported nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

  

alaska airlines revenues 

  

operating revenues increased 2764 million or 114 during 2006 due primarily to a 67 increase in operating revenue per available seat mile rasm and a 44 increase in capacity the increase in rasm was driven almost entirely by a 67 increase in ticket yields resulting largely from higher ticket prices the increase in capacity is primarily the result of having a fleet of 114 operating aircraft at december 31 2006 compared to 110 at december 31 2005 and a longer average stage length this year compared to last year although we do not provide specific revenue forecasts yearoveryear rasm was up 13 in january 2007 compared to january 2006 however our january 2007 passenger rasm was down 08 from the same time in 2006 primarily because of a 25 point decline in load factor offset by a 28 increase in ticket yields as the industry adds domestic capacity in 2007 we may experience some downward pressure on yields but it is not known to what extent 

  

load factor increased slightly by 07 percentage points to 766 during 2006 due primarily to a 54 increase in passenger traffic outpacing the 44 increase in capacity we experienced a slight decline in yearoveryear load factor in the fourth quarter of 2006 we believe the decline is primarily due to the severe weather in the pacific northwest during the months of november and december but the full financial effect of those storms is difficult to determine the load factor in january 2007 was down 25 points from january 2006 to 665 we currently expect first quarter 2007 load factor will be down compared to the first quarter of 2006 

  

freight and mail revenues increased 31 million or 34 compared to 2005 primarily resulting from higher mail and freight yields and fuel surcharges that we added to our freight services beginning in the third quarter of 2005 offset by lower freight volumes revenues from our cargo operations were lower than expected for 2006 due to the delay in the delivery of our modified 737400 cargo aircraft our full freighter aircraft was delivered in 2006 although later than originally planned and the four combination passengercargo aircraft have been delayed in production three of the four were originally scheduled for delivery in 2006 but none were actually delivered during the year two were delivered in january and the remaining two are expected in the second quarter of 2007 these delays constrained the cargo operations from increasing capacity and thereby the volume of cargo shipped as we add more capacity in 2007 we expect freight and mail revenues to increase slightly compared to 2006 

  

othernet revenues increased only slightly by 32 million or 22 mileage plan revenues were slightly lower than in 2006 primarily as a result of lower commissions recognized for sold miles as yields increased in 2006 the rate at which we defer the revenue related to sold miles increased resulting in a smaller percentage of those cash receipts recorded as commission revenue during the period the decline in commission revenue associated with sold miles was partially offset by higher net revenues from award redemption on our partner airlines 

  

alaska airlines expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 5124 million or 225 as compared to 2005 this increase is largely due to fleet transition costs in 2006 a significant increase in aircraft fuel including hedging gains and losses and increases in wages and benefits variable incentive pay contracted services selling expenses depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges offset by a decline in aircraft maintenance and aircraft rent operating expenses per asm increased 173 to 1198 cents in 2006 from 1021 cents in 2005 operating expense per asm excluding fuel fleet transition costs restructuring charges and a navigation fee refund in 2005 decreased 25 as compared to 2005 our current estimates for operating costs per asm excluding fuel for mainline flying for the first quarter and full year of 2007 are between 80 cents and 81 cents and between 75 cents and 76 cents respectively achieving our cost targets is dependent on both actual spending and asm production in the past two years we have made temporary reductions to our schedule to help improve our operational results when that occurs it is difficult to remove all of the associated costs from our system and as a result our unit costs increase disproportionately if we reduce our asm plan again in 2007 then our unit costs likely would increase 

  

operating costs per asm “casm” is an important metric in the industry and we use it to gauge the effectiveness of our costreduction efforts our effort to reduce unit cost focuses not only on controlling the actual dollars we spend but also on increasing our capacity without adding a commensurate amount of cost as was the case in 2006 our goal for the next two years is to grow capacity primarily through largergauge aircraft with the introduction of the new larger 737800s and the retirement of the md80 aircraft the total number of operating aircraft in our fleet will not change significantly through 2008 along with our financial and statistical data on page 28 we are presenting here our lineitem expenses on a perasm basis in cents we believe this information is useful to investors because it highlights areas in which costs have increased or decreased either more or less than capacity 

  

   

   

explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased by 212 million or 29 during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the increase from prior year was partially offset by the following 

  

   

   

we currently expect wages and benefits to increase slightly in 2007 but decline on a perasm basis this expectation is exclusive of any potential change in pilot wages that may result from our current contract negotiations 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay increased 124 million or 810 over 2005 primarily due to a significant improvement in 2006 air group’s profit as determined in the incentive agreements for purposes of our incentive pay plans profit is generally defined as results excluding fleet transition costs restructuring charges  and other amounts specified in the various incentive plan documents and with fuel stated on an economic basis  air group maintains several incentive plans that collectively cover all of our employees and create alignment for employees customers and shareholders these plans include both operational and financial performance metrics that to a large extent are based on certain annual financial targets 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel increased 2810 million or 590 primarily due to the significant marktomarket gains recorded in 2005 that followed the sharp increases in world oil prices our raw fuel expense increased 1277 million to 7656 million driven by a 23 increase in gallons consumed and a 174 increase in raw fuel cost per gallon we realized gains of 870 million from settled hedge contracts compared to 1088 million in 2005 resulting in economic fuel expense of 6786 million a 283 increase over 2005 our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 255 from 153 in 2005 to 192 in 2006 we currently expect our economic fuel cost per gallon in 2007 to be slightly lower than in 2006 based on prevailing prices although this can change rapidly and materially 

  

in addition to our fuelhedging program we have entered into fuel contracts whereby the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices was fixed for approximately 50 of our expected consumption in the first quarter of 2007 the savings from these contracts was not material during 2006 

  

see page 31 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by alaska the economic cost per gallon and the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including all hedging gains and losses 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance decreased by 284 million or 153 mostly as a result of fewer highdollar engine maintenance events a decline in the number and change in the mix of airframe events lower perevent costs due to renegotiated contracts with our outside vendors and savings from process improvement initiatives we expect that maintenance expense will decline in 2007 in both dollars and on a perunit basis this is primarily due to the continuing retirement of the md80 aircraft the full retirement of our b737200c aircraft and the introduction of new b737800s that will require relatively very little maintenance in the nearterm 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent decreased by 59 million or 51 primarily as a result of the buyout of five md80 aircraft from leases during the third quarter of 2006 offset by two new b737800 operating leases entered into in the fourth quarter of 2006 we expect aircraft rent to decline modestly in 2007 as two additional leased md80s are returned to the lessor 

  

landing fees and other rentals 

  

landing fees and other rentals increased slightly by 20 million or 13 as a result of slightly higher airport and security costs specifically at los angeles international airport lax where a retroactive increase to the beginning of 2006 was imposed on certain carriers late in the year the increase for alaska was approximately 15 million we expect that the rate hike will increase our costs at lax by approximately 7 million per year we along with other affected carriers are disputing the rate increase at lax see further discussion under “legal proceedings” on page 21 our costs at seatac are also expected to increase in 2007 

  

contracted services 

  

contracted services increased 119 million or 99 primarily resulting from the subcontracting of the company’s seattle ramp operations in may 2005 additionally a 47 million navigation fee refund was received in 2005 which reduced our 2005 expenses we expect contracted services in 2007 to increase slightly 

  

selling expenses 

  

selling expenses increased 89 million or 67 primarily as a result of an increase in revenuerelated expenses such as credit card and codeshare commissions resulting from the rise in revenues over the prior period and an increase in incentive payments to horizon for certain flying we expect selling expenses to decline in 2007 in dollar terms and in terms of unit costs as a result of new agreements we have in place with credit card and gds vendors 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization increased 124 million or 99 compared to 2005 this increase is primarily due to the delivery of two new owned b737800 aircraft in 2005 and ten new owned b737800 aircraft in 2006 the purchase of five md80 aircraft from lessors during the third quarter of 2006 and the acceleration of depreciation on our owned md80 fleet to reduce the carrying value to estimated realizable value as they come out of the fleet offset by the lower depreciable base on the md80 fleet following the impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2006 we expect a similar increase in 2007 as we take delivery of 14 new b737800 aircraft during the year 

  

other information 

  

alaska and horizon entered into an agreement effective january 1 2007 whereby alaska will purchase from horizon capacity in certain routes “incentive markets” specified by the agreement this agreement will result in a new presentation in alaska’s statement of operations the revenue from the incentive markets will be identified as “passenger revenue—regional affiliates” and the associated costs will be identified as “regional flying costs” alaska also has a similar arrangement in place with a thirdparty carrier for flying between anchorage and dutch harbor alaska historically the revenue from this arrangement has been presented in “other revenue – net” and the associated costs have been in “contracted services” in 2007 all of these revenues and costs will be presented with the incentivemarket flying and the prior periods will be reclassified to conform 

  

horizon air revenues 

  

operating revenues increased 876 million or 157 in 2006 compared to 2005 this increase reflects an 84 increase in per unit revenues rasm and a 68 increase in capacity 

  

the capacity increase is primarily due to the addition of one crj700 in january 2006 two q400s that began operating in june and august 2006 increased capacity from adding four more seats to our q400s in the third quarter of 2005 and increased flying for frontier revenue and capacity from the frontier contract flying represented approximately 8 of passenger revenues and 23 of capacity in 2006 similar to the prior year as mentioned previously horizon will begin transitioning out of the frontier contract flying in the first quarter of 2007 

  

the rasm increase from the prioryear period resulted from a 91 rasm increase in our native network flying offset by a 14 decline in rasm from the frontier contract flying the frontier decline is a function of a 57 increase in capacity coupled with a fee arrangement based on certain measures that do not correspond to capacity as such the perunit revenues become diluted as more capacity is added passenger load factor increased 13 percentage points to 741 as a result of continued increase in demand passenger yield increased 70 to 2353 cents largely benefiting from industrywide fare increases 

  

horizon air expenses 

  

operating expenses for 2006 increased 1049 million or 199 compared to 2005 operating expenses per asm increased 122 as compared to 2005 operating expenses per asm excluding fuel increased 63 to 1419 cents compared to 1335 cents in 2005 our current estimates for costs per asm excluding fuel for the first quarter and full year of 2007 are 157 cents and 142 cents respectively the increase in costs per asm is due to the significant costs associated with the sublease loss and related maintenance costs that will be recorded as we sublease q200s to another carrier throughout the year 

  

along with our financial and statistical data on page 29 we are presenting here our line item expenses on a perasm basis in cents 

  

   

explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses in dollar terms are as follows 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased 156 million or 90 over 2005 reflecting a 45 increase in the average number of fulltime equivalent employees and an increase in wages per employee we expect wages and benefits to increase slightly in 2007 but decline on a perunit basis in 2007 as we work toward higher productivity and efficiencies 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay increased 44 million or 936 over 2005 as a result of the same reasons noted above in the alaska discussion 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel increased 436 million or 598 over 2005 primarily as a result of the significant marktomarket gains recorded in 2005 that followed the sharp increases in world oil prices our raw fuel expense increased 214 million to 1191 million driven by a 58 increase in gallons consumed and a 153 increase in raw fuel cost per gallon we realized gains of 141 million from settled hedge contracts compared to 162 million in 2005 resulting in economic fuel expense of 1050 million a 288 increase over 2005 our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 222 from 158 in 2005 to 193 in 2006 like alaska we currently expect horizon’s economic fuel cost per gallon in 2007 to be slightly lower based on prevailing prices although this can change rapidly and materially we also expect our fuel consumption on a perasm to improve in 2007 as we replace some of our older q200s with new q400 aircraft which are more fuel efficient 

  

see page 32 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by horizon the economic cost per gallon and the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including all hedging gains and losses 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense increased 306 million or 707 primarily as a result of more scheduled heavy checks and engine overhauls for the q200 and q400 fleets with fewer aircraft covered under warranty we expect maintenance expense to increase again in 2007 as we anticipate a higher rate of planned maintenance activity 

  

aircraft rent 

  

aircraft rent declined slightly by 09 million or 13 in 2006 primarily resulting from the annualization of lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased engines we expect that aircraft rent will increase significantly in 2007 as we begin to recognize the sublease loss on up to 16 q200s of which 11 are expected to leave our fleet in 2007 we anticipate a charge on average of 15 million per aircraft 

  

other operating expenses 

  

other operating expenses increased by 47 million or 111 largely a result of higher crew expenses and passenger remuneration costs 

  

consolidated nonoperating income expense  

  

net nonoperating expense was 05 million in 2006 compared to 293 million in 2005 interest income increased 234 million compared to 2005 primarily as a result of higher average portfolio returns and a higher average cash and marketable securities balance interest expense increased 150 million primarily resulting from interest rate increases on our variablerate debt new debt arrangements in 2006 and the changes to some of our variablerate debt arrangements to slightly higher fixed rates this increase was offset by the conversion of our 150 million senior convertible notes to equity in april 2006 which eliminated further interest expense on those notes capitalized interest increased 158 million from 89 million in 2005 to 247 million during 2006 this is due to the significant increase in predelivery deposits in connection with our orders for b737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft we expect that nonoperating expense will increase in 2007 as we continue to finance new aircraft deliveries resulting in a higher average debt balance while at the same time maintaining a stable cash and marketable securities portfolio 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2006 was 401 compared to an effective income tax rate of 384 in 2005 the 2006 year also includes 55 million of tax benefits associated with the reduction of certain tax contingency accruals for periods for which the statute of limitations expired in 2006 excluding this benefit our effective tax benefit rate for 2006 would have been 338 which is different from our marginal 2006 tax rate of 374 the difference is primarily due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee perdiem costs and stockbased compensation expense recorded for certain stock awards we applied our 2005 marginal rate of 375 to the cumulative effect of the accounting change our remaining tax contingency accruals are not significant 

  

2005 compared with 2004 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2005 was 59 million or 001 per diluted share versus a consolidated net loss of 153 million or 057 per share in 2004 

  

our consolidated income before income tax and the accounting change for 2005 was 1372 million compared to a pretax loss in 2004 of 206 million the 2005 results include certain items that impact the comparability of the years these items are discussed in the “results of operations 2006 compared with 2005” 

  

section beginning on page 37 our 2004 results also include certain items that impact comparability including severance charges of 534 million an impairment charge of 402 million related primarily to our boeing 737200c fleet marktomarket adjustments on our hedge portfolio and a navigation fee refund of 110 million excluding those items the yearoveryear improvement can be characterized by higher revenues offset by slightly higher nonfuel operating costs and significantly higher fuel costs 

  

financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 28 and 29 respectively on pages 30 through 32 we have included a reconciliation of reported nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

  

alaska airlines revenues 

  

operating revenues increased 1831 million or 82 during 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of an 82 increase in operating revenue per available seat mile rasm on relatively flat capacity the increase in rasm was driven by a 35 increase in ticket yields that resulted from an increase in ticket prices designed to offset higher fuel prices higher load factors and higher freight mail and other revenues the flat capacity is primarily a direct result of the reduction in our summer flight schedule that was announced in june 2005 offset by the addition of three b737800 aircraft during the year 

  

load factor increased 30 percentage points to a record 759 for 2005 primarily as a result of an increase in passenger traffic 

  

freight and mail revenues increased by 39 million or 45 compared to 2004 as a result of a mail contract we have in the state of alaska that began in the third quarter of 2004 and fuel surcharges added to our freight services during the third quarter of 2005 offset by lower freight volumes 

  

othernet revenues increased 198 million or 161 largely a result of an increase in mileage plan revenues derived from higher award redemption on our partner airlines and an increase in commission revenue associated with sold mileage credits and an increase in our revenues from service to dutch harbor which is operated by a third party 

  

alaska airlines expenses 

  

in 2005 total operating expenses increased 332 million or 15 compared to 2004 operating expenses per asm increased 14 from 1007 cents in 2004 to 1021 cents in 2005 the increase in operating expenses is due largely to the significant increase in raw fuel expense and increases in aircraft maintenance contracted services landing fees and other rentals and other offset by larger gains on our fuel hedge portfolio declines in wages and benefits food and beverage service selling expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring charges and the impairment charge in 2004 related to our boeing 737200c fleet operating expenses per asm excluding fuel the navigation fee refund restructuring and impairment charges increased 11 compared to 2004 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits decreased 732 million or 92 during 2005 compared to 2004 wages were favorably impacted by the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the yearoveryear decline in wages and benefits was partially offset by a favorable 66 million adjustment in 2004 related to the ultimate loss estimates for workers compensation 

  

overall the reduction in wages and benefits costs were partially offset by increases in contracted services and maintenance expense as a result of the subcontracting of certain operations 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay increased 109 million due to air group’s improved financial performance as defined in the incentive plans 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel increased 793 million or 200 primarily as a result of the sharp increases in world oil prices our raw fuel expense increased 1513 million to 6379 million driven by a 343 increase in raw fuel cost per gallon offset by a 23 decline in fuel gallons consumed we realized gains of 1088 million from settled hedge contracts compared to 398 million in 2004 resulting in economic fuel expense of 5291 million a 184 increase over 2004 our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 214 from 126 in 2004 to 153 in 2005 

  

in the second quarter of 2005 we entered into a fuel contract whereby the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices is fixed for approximately onethird of our fuel consumption through april 2006 this contract resulted in approximately 10 million in savings for alaska during 2005 

  

see page 31 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by alaska the economic cost per gallon and the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including all hedging gains and losses 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance increased 394 million or 270 largely resulting from the performance of more airframe work and engine overhauls in 2005 than were performed in 2004 other factors causing the increase were our powerbythehour maintenance agreement whereby we expense b737400 engine maintenance on a flighthour basis regardless of whether the work was actually performed during the period the contracting out of related heavy maintenance to third parties which resulted in a shift of costs from wages and benefits into aircraft maintenance the change in our accounting policy regarding engine and airframe overhauls see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements as well as certain enhancements to aircraft interiors systems and flight decks to assist with reliability improvement 

  

landing fees and other rentals 

  

landing fees and other rentals increased 199 million or 146 the increase reflects higher landing fee rates and increased rental costs primarily in seattle portland and los angeles offset by fewer departures 

  

contracted services 

  

contracted services increased 234 million or 242 largely resulting from the subcontracting of our fleet service and ground support equipment and facility maintenance functions in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the seattle ramp operations in may 2005 additionally the navigation fee refund recorded in contracted services was 47 million in 2005 compared to 77 million in 2004 

  

other expenses 

  

other expenses increased 90 million or 61 primarily reflecting increases in passenger remuneration crew costs supplies and legal settlement costs partly offset by lower insurance premiums additionally in 2004 there were 20 million in losses on disposal of assets compared to 30 million in 2005 

  

horizon air revenues 

  

in 2005 operating revenues increased 532 million or 106 compared to 2004 this increase is due largely to the increased capacity in both the horizonbrand flying and contract flying for frontier airlines which began in january 2004 combined with the slight increase in operating revenues per available seat mile rasm the increase in rasm was due primarily to an increase in load factors partially offset by a 28 decline in ticket yields 

  

load factor increased 35 percentage points to 728 for 2005 primarily as a result of the 148 increase in passenger traffic outpacing the 94 increase in capacity the increases in passenger traffic and capacity are due primarily to increased contract flying with frontier the harmonization flying with alaska the addition of one crj700 in 2005 and four additional seats on each of our q400s contract flying with frontier represented approximately 9 of passenger revenues and 23 of capacity during 2005 compared to 9 and 21 respectively in 2004 

  

horizon air expenses 

  

operating expenses for 2005 increased 432 million or 89 compared to 2004 operating expenses per asm decreased 05 compared to 2004 operating expenses per asm excluding fuel and impairment charges decreased 17 compared to 2004 

  

wages and benefits 

  

wages and benefits increased 111 million or 68 reflecting a slight increase in the average number of employees and wages per employee and the move to a new paidtimeoff program resulting in a onetime charge related to the transition 

  

variable incentive pay 

  

variable incentive pay increased 38 million reflecting the improved financial performance and a new operationallybased incentive program for all employees 

  

aircraft fuel 

  

aircraft fuel costs increased 144 million or 246 primarily resulting from the sharp increases in world oil prices our raw fuel expense increased 270 million to 977 million driven by a 32 increase in gallons consumed and a 338 increase in raw fuel cost per gallon we realized gains of 162 million from settled hedge contracts compared to 54 million in 2004 resulting in economic fuel expense of 815 million a 248 increase over 2004 our economic fuel cost per gallon increased 206 from 131 in 2004 to 158 in 2005 

  

see page 32 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by horizon the economic cost per gallon and the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including all hedging gains and losses 

  

aircraft maintenance 

  

aircraft maintenance expense increased 50 million or 131 primarily due to a higher number of engine overhauls and propeller work for the q400 fleet and to fewer aircraft being covered by warranty 

  

landing fees and other rentals 

  

landing fees and other rentals increased 63 million or 152 higher landing fees are a result of significant rate increases at several of our key airports and to increased departures and new markets served 

  

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating expense was 293 million in 2005 compared to 263 million in 2004 interest income increased 64 million as a result of improved returns and a slightly larger average marketable securities portfolio in 2005 offset by the interest income in 2004 associated with the navigation fee refund interest expense increased 111 million due to interest rate increases on our variablerate debt and the changes to some of our variablerate debt agreements to slightly higher fixedrate agreements capitalized interest increased 72 million in 2005 this increase is due to the significant increase in deposits for future flight equipment resulting from orders for boeing 737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2005 was 384 compared to an effective income tax rate of 257 on a pretax loss in 2004 due to the magnitude of nondeductible expense such as employee perdiem costs relative to a marginal pretax profit or loss a relatively small change in pretax results may cause a significant change in the effective tax rate we applied our 2005 marginal rate of 375 to the cumulative effect of the accounting change 

  

change in accounting policy 

  

effective january 1 2005 we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method under the former method these costs were capitalized and amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term under the direct expense method overhaul costs are expensed as incurred we believe that the direct expense method is preferable because it eliminates the judgment and estimation needed to determine overhaul versus repair allocations in maintenance activities additionally our approved maintenance program for the majority of our airframes now focuses more on shorter but more frequent maintenance visits we also believe that the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry accordingly effective january 1 2005 we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft resulting in a charge of 1447 million pretax 904 million after tax we do not believe disclosing the effect of adopting the direct expense method on net income for 2005 provides meaningful information because of changes in our maintenance program including the execution of a “powerbythehour” engine maintenance agreement with a third party in late 2004 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may result in materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our many travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our credit card partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties the majority of the sales 

  

proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the commission component of these sales proceeds defined as the proceeds we receive from the sale of mileage credits minus the amount we defer is recorded as othernet revenue when the cash is received the deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines 

  

at december 31 2006 we had approximately 103 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of 5456 million both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption could greatly affect the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

  

1 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles 

  

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as fare levels change our deferral rate changes which may result in the recognition of a higher or lower portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of miles as commission revenue in any given quarter for example due to the yearoveryear increases in average industry ticket prices our deferral rate increased in 2006 resulting in lower commission revenue and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred for miles sold holding all other assumptions constant an additional 1 increase in the deferral rate would have reduced our 2006 commission revenue by approximately 21 million 

  

2 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel breakage 

  

members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel therefore based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts we estimate how many miles will never be used “breakage” and do not record a liability for those miles our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members’ accounts account balances and other factors we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable in light of historical experience and future expectations a hypothetical 10 change in our estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 60 million effect on the liability actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates 

  

3 the number of miles used per award ie free ticket 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award for example our members may redeem credit for free travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska horizon or other airlines 

  

4 the number of awards redeemed for travel on alaska or horizon versus other airlines 

  

the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines we estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus on other airlines and accrue the costs based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

  

5 the costs that will be incurred to provide award travel 

  

when a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on alaska or horizon incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be 

  

excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

we review mileage plan estimates each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

pension plans 

  

we account for the definedbenefit pension plans using sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 sfas 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity’s definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status in other comprehensive income under sfas no 158 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 783 million 717 million and 783 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions at december 31 2006 the fair value of our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets totaled 8359 million we contributed 1219 million to the plan in 2006 and anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately 50 million during 2007 

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of december 31 2006 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 775 this rate was developed with input from consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2006 is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixed income securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 775 to 725 would increase our estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately 42 million 

  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 575 and 550 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on highquality longterm bonds decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 575 to 525 would increase our projected benefit obligation at december 31 2006 by approximately 749 million and increase estimated 2007 pension expense by approximately 90 million 

  

with the exception of the plan covering alaska’s pilots all of our definedbenefit pension plans are closed to new entrants 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 24 billion of property and equipment and related assets in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets 

  

changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

  

in march 2006 our board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of our md80 fleet 15 owned and 11 leased aircraft at the time and remove those aircraft from service by the end of 2008 which is earlier than the original retirement schedule as a result of this decision we evaluated impairment as required by sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and concluded that the carrying value of the md80 fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows accordingly during the first quarter of 2006 the company recorded an impairment charge totaling 1311 million to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value additionally during the third quarter of 2006 we bought five md80 aircraft from lessors and terminated the leases for those five aircraft the total purchase price for the five aircraft was 809 million including assumed debt of 116 million immediately upon purchase of the aircraft we evaluated impairment and concluded that the carrying value was not recoverable as a result we recorded an additional 584 million charge in the third quarter for the impairment see note 2 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the impairment of the md80s and a similar impairment to our boeing 737200 aircraft recorded in 2004 

  

there is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and their salvage values at the time of an impairment actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft could be materially less than expected resulting in additional loss our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft 

  

workers’ compensation and employee healthcare accruals 

  

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for workers’ compensation claims and employee healthcare benefits liabilities associated with these risks are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends our workers’ compensation and employee health care accruals totaled 357 million at december 31 2006 compared to 344 million at december 31 2005 

  

realizability of deferred tax assets 

  

the company has a net deferred tax asset of 196 million at december 31 2006 which includes gross deferred tax assets of 5042 million partially offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of 4846 million in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the available evidence we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2006 our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income should we incur additional losses in the future our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty 

  

new accounting standards 

  

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 sab 108 sab 108 expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether those misstatements are material to our financial statements sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 we adopted sab 108 effective january 1 2006 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions as defined in that statement the purpose of fin 48 is to clarify certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income tax uncertainties this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we do not believe this interpretation will have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fairvalue measurements required under other accounting pronouncements sfas 157 does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas 157 but do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our results from operations or financial position 

  

in june 2006 the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0603 how sales collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation  the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure eitf 0603 is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december 31 2006 taxes collected from our passengers which include sales taxes airport and security fees and other fees are and have been recorded on a net basis we have no intention of modifying this accounting policy as such the adoption of eitf 0603 will not have an effect on our results from operations or financial position 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

  

   

our debttocapital ratio including aircraft operating leases decreased from december 31 2005 primarily as a result of the conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes in april 2006 partially offset by a 526 million net loss for 2006 unfavorable adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and postretirement obligations totaling 614 million after tax an 186 million aftertax adjustment to equity upon our adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 108 and an increase in our outstanding debt in connection with new aircraftsecured debt arrangements in 2006 

  

during the year ended december 31 2006 our cash and marketable securities increased 313 million to 10139 million the following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase and our expectation of future cash requirements 

  

analysis of cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2006 net cash provided by operating activities was 4498 million compared to 2701 million during 2005 the improvement was driven by significantly higher operating revenues and a decline in cash payments made for severance compared to the prior year offset by continued increases in fuel costs and 1219 million in cash contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans during 2006 compared to 693 million during the same period in 2005 we typically generate positive cash flows from operations but anticipate consuming substantially all of that cash for capital expenditures and debt payments in the next several years 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 5330 million during 2006 compared to 4811 million in 2005 we had net sales of 1294 million of marketable securities and spent 6785 million for property and equipment additions net of proceeds from asset dispositions resulting in an increase of 2681 million compared to 2005 the increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the increase in predelivery payments made for future aircraft deliveries and the purchase in 2006 of ten b737800s five md80s out of leases two q400s and one crj700 compared to three b737800s in 2005 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 680 million of which 605 million is expected to be aircraftrelated in 2007 as we take delivery of 14 new b737800 and 13 new bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

cash provided by used in financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 2403 million during 2006 compared to 2566 million during 2005 we obtained debt financing for nine new b737800 aircraft and one crj700 purchased in 2006 we had 304 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan compared to 152 million during 2005 offsetting these increases were normal longterm debt payments of 620 million and debt payments on our predelivery payment facility of 1406 million in 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2005 we issued 57 million shares of common stock for proceeds of 2000 million net of underwriting discounts and professional fees 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand additional debt financing and availability of credit under our predelivery payment facility we have debt financing arranged for 10 of our 14 firm 2007 deliveries of b737800s and are currently negotiating financing for the q400s 

  

supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing activities 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 we called for redemption all of our 150 million senior convertible notes and all of the notes were converted by the holders into shares of our common stock additionally we assumed debt totaling 116 million in connection with the purchase of one of the md80 aircraft purchased from lessors during the third quarter of 2006 

  

bank lineofcredit facility 

  

alaska has a 160 million variablerate credit facility that expires in march 2008 as of december 31 2006 there are no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and the company has no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility see note 7 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

predelivery payment facility 

  

alaska’s 172 million variablerate revolving loan facility is available to provide a portion of the predelivery funding requirements of alaska’s purchase of new boeing 737800 aircraft under the current aircraft purchase agreement the facility expires on august 31 2009 the interest rate is based on onemonth libor 

  

plus a specified margin any borrowings will be secured by alaska’s rights under the boeing purchase agreement the principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid at the time that alaska takes delivery of the aircraft if not sooner likely using proceeds from longterm debt financing on those aircraft as of december 31 2006 392 million was outstanding no amounts have been borrowed subsequent to yearend although we may use the facility in the future to fund additional predelivery payments 

  

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

at december 31 2006 we had firm orders for 51 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately 12 billion as set forth below alaska has options to acquire 24 additional b737s and purchase rights for 27 more and horizon has options to acquire 19 q400s and 15 crj700s alaska and horizon expect to finance the firm orders and to the extent exercised the option aircraft with leases longterm debt or internally generated cash 

  

during 2006 alaska took delivery of 12 b737800s two of which are under operating lease agreements one was paid for with cash on hand and nine were paid for with cash and then subsequently financed with fixedrate debt arrangements horizon took delivery of two used q400s both of which were paid for with cash on hand and one crj700 which was financed with a variablerate debt arrangement during 2006 alaska executed an arrangement to sell six b737200 aircraft title to each aircraft will be transferred as each of the aircraft leaves our fleet over the next several months with the last aircraft expected to leave our fleet in april 2007 two of these aircraft were sold during 2006 and two were sold subsequent to the end of the year all of which resulted in nominal gains on the transactions 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year as of december 31 2006 

  

   

two of the b737800 aircraft and four of the q400s were delivered subsequent to december 31 2006 the two b737800 were paid for with cash on hand and subsequently debtfinanced the q400s were paid for with cash on hand management is currently reviewing financing alternatives for the q400s but no agreements have been executed as of the date of this report the remaining b737800 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2007 are generally evenly spread throughout the rest of the year the majority of the 13 q400s will be delivered in the first six months of the year financing for seven of the remaining 11 b737800 aircraft deliveries in 2007 has already been arranged the other four deliveries are expected to be paid for with cash on hand the company is evaluating financing options for the q400 deliveries 

  

if we are able to successfully achieve targeted profitability and implement our growth strategy alaska and horizon will continue to convert additional options and purchase rights into firm orders resulting in capital expenditure spending  

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other 

  

obligations as of december 31 2006 this table excludes contributions to our various pension plans which we expect to be approximately 50 million to 80 million per year through 2010 

  

      

effect of inflation and price changes 

  

inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   

we have interestrate risk on our floatingrate debt obligations and our availableforsale marketable investment portfolio and commodityprice risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy and other means we have marketsensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jetfuel price increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

market risk – aircraft fuel 

  

currently our fuelhedging portfolio consists almost exclusively of crude oil call options we utilize the contracts in our portfolio as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices call options are designed to effectively cap our cost of the crude oil component of fuel prices allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing fuel prices with these call option contracts we still benefit from the decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premiums that we pay to enter into the contracts although to a lesser extent we also use collar structures for fuel hedging purposes we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases see note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our hedge positions we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2006 would increase or decrease the fair value of our hedge portfolio by approximately 236 million and 205 million respectively 

  

additionally we have entered into fuel purchase contracts that fix the refining margin we pay for approximately 50 of alaska’s fuel consumption in the first quarter of 2007 

  

please refer to pages 30 through 32 as well as to note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for companyspecific data on the results of our fuelhedging program 

  

financial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2006 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 26 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we fixed the interest rates on certain existing variablerate debt agreements in 2005 and 2006 additionally several of our new debt arrangements in 2006 were fixedrate arrangements and we converted our variablerate 150 million senior notes to equity in 2006 as a result our variablerate debt is approximately 37 of our total longterm debt at december 31 2006 compared to 44 at december 31 2005 

  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2006 interest income would increase by approximately 41 basis points

alaska airlines inc is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 alaska principally serves destinations in the state of alaska and northsouth service between cities in the western us canada and mexico alaska also provides eastwest service to 8 cities primarily from seattle in 2005 alaska carried 168 million revenue passengers in each year since 1973 alaska has carried more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline west coast passenger traffic accounted for 47 of alaska’s 2005 revenue passenger miles passenger traffic within alaska and between alaska and the us mainland accounted for 20 the mexico markets accounted for 10 the canada markets accounted for 5 and other markets accounted for 18 based on passenger enplanements alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles portland and anchorage based on 2005 revenues its leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlesan diego at december 31 2005 alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 110 jet aircraft 

  

horizon 

  

horizon air industries inc a washington corporation was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves 40 cities in seven states and six cities in canada under the horizon brand the horizon brand flying consists of horizon’s native network flying and contract flying for alaska in addition to operating under the horizon brand on january 1 2004 horizon began operating regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a 12year agreement with frontier airlines horizon is currently operating nine 70seat bombardier crj700 aircraft under the frontier jetexpress brand representing approximately 23 of total horizon capacity and approximately 9 of total horizon revenue in 2005 in 2005 horizon carried 65 million revenue passengers approximately 95 of horizon’s revenue passenger miles are flown domestically primarily in the states of washington oregon and idaho the canada markets accounted for 5 of revenue passenger miles in 2005 based on passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland boise and spokane based on revenues in 2005 its leading nonstop routes are portlandseattle spokaneseattle and seattlevancouver at december 31 2005 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 19 jets and 46 turboprop aircraft except for those flights operating as frontier jetexpress horizon flights are listed under the alaska airlines designator code in airline reservation systems 

  

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide service between any two points served by their systems in 2005 24 of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska compared to 28 in 2004 both airlines endeavor to distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer service the airlines’ outstanding employees and excellent service in the form of advance seat assignments expedited checkin attention to customer needs a generous frequent flyer program wellmaintained aircraft a firstclass section aboard alaska aircraft and other amenities are regularly recognized by independent studies and surveys of air travelers 

  

industry conditions 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and is characterized by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership costs and facilities rents because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current events and industry capacity 

  

the industry is currently in a state of flux the airline industry continued to be challenged in 2005 resulting in bankruptcy filings by several of the major “legacy” carriers during the year including delta airlines and northwest airlines under bankruptcy reorganization carriers gain a competitive advantage by significantly reducing their costs in addition so called “low cost carriers” lccs have continued to grow rapidly and currently carry more than 30 of total us domestic passenger traffic because of their cost advantage lccs have and continue to exert downward pressure on ticket prices from historical levels although fares have increased on average in 2005 in response to high fuel prices because of the relatively low barriers to entry we expect the expansion of low cost and low fare carriers to continue we compete with many of these carriers now and expect to compete with new entrants in the future 

  

most major us carriers including alaska are working aggressively to cut operating costs including renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements and vendor agreements labor costs generally make up 30 to 40 of an airline’s total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups who are represented by collective bargaining agreements often airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward fast enough to respond to new competition we have been able to reduce our wage and benefit costs during 2005 primarily as a result of a reduction in pilot wages which took effect in may 2005 subcontracting our ramp services operation in seattle beginning in the second quarter of 2005 the closure of our heavy maintenance facility in oakland the subcontracting of our fleet services and our management reorganization all of which occurred during the last six months of 2004 our wage and benefit costs decreased 5 in 2005 versus increases of 3 and 10 in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

fuel costs generally represent 15 to 25 of an airline’s operating costs fuel prices can be volatile and largely uncontrollable fuel prices have increased significantly over the past three years our fuel cost per gallon increased 36 44 and 15 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our economic fuel cost per gallon which is the net price we pay after the benefit of settled fuel hedges increased 21 in 2005 39 in 2004 and 14 in 2003 

  

during 2005 and 2004 load factors increased in the wake of strong demand and a healthy economy load factor growth slowed in the second half of 2005 however revenues remained strong due to improving yields as the industry responded to record high fuel prices 

  

marketing and competition 

  

alliances with other airlines 

  

alaska and horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges and code sharing on certain flights as set forth below alliances enhance alaska’s and horizon’s revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage creditredemption opportunities and by gaining us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and by providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation if a significant agreement were terminated it could adversely impact revenues and increase the costs of our other marketing agreements in september 2005 both northwest and delta filed for protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code followed by era aviation in december 2005 any of these carriers could propose plans of reorganization that would seek to modify or terminate some or all of these agreements 

  

most of our code share relationships are freesell code shares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk the table below identifies our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2005 

  

     

competition 

  

competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any domestic air carrier issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the department of transportation dot and an operating certificate from the federal aviation administration faa is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the united states together alaska and horizon carry approximately 33 of all us domestic passenger traffic alaska and horizon compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes including southwest airlines united airlines northwest airlines continental airlines american airlines delta airlines and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company others are operating under bankruptcy court protection and may institute substantial fare discounts in order to maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty in addition competitors who successfully reorganize out of bankruptcy could have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements some of these competitors have chosen to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets continuing growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airlines airtran airways frontier airlines jetblue airways and the emergence of virgin america in the united states places significant competitive pressures on us and other network carriers since they have the ability to charge a lower fare for travel between similar cities and thus exert downward pressure on yields as such we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve due to its short haul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation including train bus and automobile transportation 

  

ticket distribution 

  

airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

  

   

   

   

we currently participate in all of these distribution channels but we cannot predict the terms on which we may be able to continue to participate in these or other channels or their effect on our ability to compete with other airlines 

  

employees 

  

the airline business is labor intensive air group had 13768 alaska and horizon had 9866 and 3902 respectively active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2005 compared to 14584 10850 at alaska and 3734 at horizon as of december 31 2004 wages salaries and benefits represented approximately 31 and 35 of our total operating expenses in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

at december 31 2005 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 46 of horizon’s employees our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act rla under this act the collective bargaining agreements between the respective airlines and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the rla andor described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to appoint a federal mediator if no agreement is reached in mediation the national mediation board may declare that an impasse exists at which point the national mediation board proffers binding arbitration to the parties either party may decline to submit to arbitration if arbitration is rejected by either party a 30day “cooling off” period commences during that period a presidential emergency board may be established which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution the presidential emergency board process lasts for 30 days and is followed by a “cooling off” period of 30 days at the end of a “cooling off” period unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “selfhelp” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to replace strikers 

  

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2005 were as follows 

  

    

horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2005 were as follows 

  

   

regulation 

  

general 

  

the airline deregulation act of 1978 as amended eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation however the department of transportation dot and the federal aviation administration faa still exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us a certificate is of unlimited duration but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificate itself in addition the dot maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international code share agreements alliance agreements between domestic major airlines international route authorities and certain consumer protection matters such as advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 

  

the faa through the promulgation of the federal aviation regulations fars generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrieroperating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved both our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate the maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls from time to time the faa issues airworthiness directives ads that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations we are and expect to be in compliance with all applicable requirements of these ads within the required time periods all airlines including alaska and horizon are subject to routine enforcement actions from time to time brought by the faa for alleged violations of the requirements of the fars or ads at this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate 

  

the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements to the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  

the aviation and transportation security act the security act generally provides for enhanced aviation security measures pursuant to the security act the transportation security administration tsa is responsible for aviation security the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property including us mail cargo carryon and checked baggage and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft the tsa performs these functions with its own federal employees the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights 

  

the security act imposes a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures in addition carriers are required to pay an additional amount to the tsa to cover the total cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 we paid 126 million to tsa for this security charge in both 2005 and 2004 and 84 million in 2003 in january 2006 the tsa notified air carriers of an increased assessment for the cost of security the industry has opposed and disagrees with the higher assessment and is working with the tsa on a resolution the additional assessment for us was not material separate from the tsa assessment the us congress is currently considering a new law that could significantly increase this security fee 

  

airline fares 

  

airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the dot maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve while air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  

although we do not currently anticipate such to the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit our flexibility with respect to fares our revenue management system our operations or other aspects of our customer service operations our financial results could be adversely affected 

  

environmental matters 

  

we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration known as osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency or epa osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements we maintain our own continuing safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

  

the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews the airport noise and capacity act generally requires faa approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft we have had and believe we will continue to have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions 

  

at december 31 2005 all of our aircraft met the stage 3 noise requirements under the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 however special noise ordinances restrict the timing of flights operated by alaska horizon and other airlines at burbank long beach orange county san diego san jose sun valley chicago o’hare and palm springs in addition orange county reagan national and long beach airports restrict the type of aircraft and number of flights 

  

although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot be assured that new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate will not harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

  

customer service 

  

along with other domestic airlines we have implemented a customer service plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds 

  

fuel 

  

our operations are significantly affected by the price and potentially the availability of jet fuel fuel costs were approximately 24 of our total operating expenses in 2005 19 in 2004 and 15 in 2003 before the benefit of fuel hedges that settled during the period raw or unhedged fuel prices which are volatile and outside of our control can have a significant impact on our operating results currently a onecent change in the economic fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 40 million we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices 

  

in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel we purchase fuel hedge contracts that include call options and collar agreements and in addition we have entered into a fuel purchase agreement that fixes the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices due to the competitive nature of the airline industry airlines often have been unable to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares although some fuelrelated industry fare increases have occurred recently conversely any potential benefit of lower fuel prices may be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues because of rising fuel prices over the last few years our fuelhedging program has resulted in significant savings see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of our fuel hedging activities 

  

while we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas there could be reductions in the production andor importation of crude oil and resulting price increases which could adversely affect our business if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel our business would be adversely affected 

  

mileage plan program 

  

all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner a grocery store chain a telephone company hotels and car rental agencies alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or terminate the program 

  

mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to capacitycontrolled seating mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity in that member’s account as of december 31 2005 and 2004 alaska estimated that approximately 30 million and 25 million respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20000mile free roundtrip domestic ticket award threshold of those eligible awards alaska estimated that approximately 88 of those awards would ultimately be redeemed for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 750000 631000 and 606000 roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 79 73 and 87 for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 239900 212000 and 174000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 

  

for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to its nonairline partners alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided on alaska or another partner airline the deferred proceeds 

  

are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as other revenuenet for awards issued and flown on other airlines at december 31 2005 and 2004 the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 4668 million and 4093 million respectively the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits revenue attributable to the mileage plan was 1802 million 1431 million and 1390 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

other information 

  

seasonality and other factors 

  

our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operating income is generally lowest or loss the greatest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic and sometimes due to adverse weather conditions generally increases in the second quarter and generally reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of spring and summer vacation travel including increased activity in the state of alaska 

  

in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and weather affect our operating results from quarter to quarter many of our areas of operations experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and in the pacific northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

  

the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions fare initiatives fluctuations in fuel prices labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern 

  

no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers consequently the loss of our largest few customers would not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

insurance 

  

we carry insurance for passenger liability and property and aircraft damage in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice 

  

as a result of the events of september 11 2001 aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for thirdparty liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general although insurance rates have declined since that time they are still somewhat above preseptember 11 levels and will likely remain there for the foreseeable future 

  

pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 as amended by the consolidated appropriations act 2005 the government has offered and we have accepted war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august 31 2006 

  

other government matters 

  

we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military callup the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft

as of december 31 2005 32 of the 62 aircraft owned by alaska are subject to liens securing longterm debt and the majority of the other owned aircraft serve as collateral on our 160 million line of credit alaska’s leased 737400 737700 737800 and md80 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2006 and 2016 between 2006 and 2010 in 2015 and between 2007 and 2013 respectively horizon’s leased q400 and crj 700 aircraft have expiration dates between 2006 and 2018 and between 2018 and 2020 respectively alaska and horizon have the option to extend most of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the thenfairmarket value of the aircraft 

  

ground facilities and services 

  

alaska and horizon lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports they serve alaska also owns terminal buildings in various cities in the state of alaska 

  

alaska has centralized operations in several buildings located at or near seattletacoma international airport seatac in seattle washington the owned buildings including land unless located on leased airport property include a threebay hangar facility with maintenance shops a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an informationprocessing center several office buildings and our corporate headquarters alaska also leases a twobay hangaroffice facility at seatac a warehouse and reservationoffice facility in kent wa and a reservation center in boise id alaska’s other major facilities include a regional headquarters building and hangar in anchorage an air cargo facility leased land in anchorage and a reservations center in phoenix 

  

horizon owns its seattle corporate headquarters building it leases an operations training and aircraft maintenance facility in portland and maintenance facilities in boise pasco seattle and spokane 

  

during 2005 alaska subcontracted its ground handling services at the seattletacoma international airport to a vendor that provides similar services to alaska at airports including portland los angeles and san francisco alaska continues to use its own employees for ground handling services at airports in the state of alaska other airports throughout our system are contracted to various thirdparty vendors

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

in may 2005 the air line pilots association filed a lawsuit in federal district court in seattle to overturn the current labor contract covering alaska’s pilots as established by an arbitrator which was effective may 1 2005 on july 21 2005 alaska filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on october 28 2005 the district court granted alaska’s motion to dismiss this matter is closed 

  

in march 2005 alaska filed a lawsuit in federal district court in seattle against the international association of machinists iam seeking to compel arbitration of a dispute regarding the permissibility under the collective bargaining agreement of subcontracting of alaska’s ramp service operation in seattle on may 10 2005 the iam filed a counter claim against alaska alleging that alaska violated the railway labor act status quo and engaged in bad faith bargaining by among other things stating that it would subcontract the seattle ramp work if it could not reach agreement with the iam on an acceptable new labor contract on may 13 2005 alaska subcontracted the ramp service operation in seattle resulting in the immediate reduction of approximately 475 employees represented by the iam shortly after this event the iam filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to reverse the subcontracting by alaska that motion was heard and denied by a federal court judge on june 2 2005 alaska filed a motion to dismiss the iam counterclaim the court dismissed the iam’s status quo claim and the bad faith bargaining claim to the extent it was based on the seattle ramp subcontracting as opposed to other conduct during the parties’ negotiations the court stated that the iam shall file an amended counterclaim by january 18 2006 but the iam did not do so on february 6 2006 the court entered an order directing the iam to show cause why its counterclaim should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute the iam submitted its response to the court’s order to show cause on february 16 2006 but the court has not yet issued a ruling on the matter a trial date has been set for september 2006 

  

in addition to the cases noted above we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business and with respect to which no material liability is expected management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to materially affect our financial position or results of operations this forwardlooking statement is based on management’s current understanding of the relevant law and facts it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k all statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors some of which we cannot predict or control for a discussion of our risk factors see “item 1a risk factors” beginning on page 12 and “risk factors” beginning on page 42 

  

general 

  

alaska and horizon operate as airlines however their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska is a major airline and principally serves destinations in the state of alaska and northsouth service between cities in the western us canada and mexico alaska also provides eastwest service to 8 cities primarily from seattle it operates an alljet fleet and its average passenger trip in 2005 was 1009 miles horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest northern california and western canada it operates both jet and turboprop aircraft and its average passenger trip in 2005 was 382 miles 

  

year in review and current events 

  

improved revenue from industrywide fare increases record load factors and a 42 increase in passenger traffic helped to define a positive story for 2005 despite relatively flat capacity at alaska alaska’s capacity was flat compared to the prior year due to actions taken in response to the operational difficulties described below horizon reported significant increases in passenger traffic resulting in increased revenues offset by slightly lower yield operating expenses per available seat mile increased 46 at alaska to 1089 cents and 18 at horizon to 1618 cents compared to 2004 although fuel prices dipped in the fourth quarter fuel again hit record highs during 2005 and played a major part in the increase in unit costs at alaska our unit costs excluding fuel a navigation fee refund restructuring and impairment charges increased 11 to 801 cents compared to 2004 this is primarily due to the capacity reduction during the summer and slightly higher nonfuel operating costs compared to 2004 horizon had a 17 decrease in unit costs excluding fuel and impairment charges coming in at 1335 cents overall our operating results are positive considering the continued significant losses for the industry as a whole and several large carriers seeking bankruptcy protection in 2005 

  

although revenues and pretax income at alaska improved over the prior year we faced operational difficulties during much of the year due to the combined effects of the labor and operational changes across our company during 2005 the result was operational performance that was well below our goal during much of the summer months however we began to see improvement in ontime arrivals and departures during much of september and october although we again experienced seasonal declines in these metrics in the latter months of the year in order to improve our operational performance we reduced our 2005 summer capacity from our original expectations through schedule reductions and the elimination of certain flights 

  

common stock offering 

  

in december 2005 we completed an offering of 57 million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately 200 million see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

accounting change 

  

effective january 1 2005 we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method accordingly effective january 1 2005 we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft in a charge totaling 1447 million pretax 904 million after tax see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further details 

  

restructuring charges 

  

in the first quarter of 2005 we recorded asset impairment and rental charges of 80 million related to our decision to terminate the lease at our oakland heavy maintenance base these charges are included in “restructuring charges” in the statements of operations as of december 31 2005 there was no accrual remaining related to these charges 

  

during the second quarter of 2005 we contracted out our seattle ramp operations to a third party this resulted in an immediate reduction of approximately 475 employees we offered a severance package substantially the same as the severance packages offered to other employees in late 2004 to those affected by the subcontracting that included cash payments based on years of service one year of medical coverage after the severance date and continued travel benefits for a period of time the labor group accepted the severance package in june 2005 and as a result we recorded a charge of 161 million in the second quarter of 2005 

  

offsetting these charges is a 37 million adjustment related to changes in our estimated costs of medical coverage extended to impacted employees from current and prior restructuring efforts and a change in the number of employees affected since the original accruals were recorded resulting in a net restructuring charge for the year of 204 million 127 million after tax 

  

the following table displays the activity and balance of the severance and related cost components of the company’s restructuring accrual as of and for the year ended december 31 2005  in millions 

  

   

labor costs and negotiations 

  

we executed new labor contracts with the alaska pilots dispatchers and mechanics and with the horizon mechanics and dispatchers in 2005 through either the negotiation or arbitration process as further described below 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are pleased with the contracts that have been reached recently and we are continuing to negotiate with our other workgroups to reach agreement on contracts that would benefit both our employees and our shareholders none of the contract negotiations is at an impasse or has reached the 30day cooling off period required under the railway labor act that would trigger self help therefore we currently believe the risk of a work stoppage is low 

  

marktomarket fuel hedging gains 

  

beginning in the second quarter of 2004 we lost the ability to defer as a component of comprehensive income recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed we lost this ability because the price correlation between crude oil the commodity we use to hedge and west coast jet fuel fell below required thresholds for more discussion see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the implications of this change are twofold first our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market each quarterend and report the gain or loss in other nonoperating income or expense even though the actual consumption will take place in a future period in times of rising fuel prices such as in 2005 this will have the effect of increasing our reported net income or decreasing our reported net loss our marktomarket gains recorded in 2005 for contracts that settle in future periods net of the reclassification of previously recorded marktomarket gains for settled hedges were 617 million 386 million after tax second to a large extent the impact of our fuel hedge program will not be reflected in fuel expense in 2005 we recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling 1250 million but only 128 million of that gain is reflected as an offset to fuel expense with the balance reported in other nonoperating income expense 

  

we have provided information on marktomarket gains or losses as well as calculations of our economic fuel cost per gallon on pages 21 and 22 

  

we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices 

  

navigation fee refund 

  

in august 2005 alaska recorded a net refund totaling 57 million 36 million after tax from the mexican government related to navigation fees paid in 2004 approximately 47 million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to contracted services expenses and 10 million was recorded as interest income this is compared to an 110 million refund 63 million after tax recorded during the third quarter of 2004 

  

aircraft commitments 

  

on june 15 2005 alaska airlines inc entered into an aircraft purchase agreement with the boeing company to purchase 35 b737800 aircraft with deliveries beginning in january 2006 and continuing through april 2011 the purchase agreement includes options to purchase an additional 15 aircraft with deliveries between july 2007 and april 2009 the order also includes rights to purchase an additional 50 737800s under the same terms except that purchase rights are not assigned specific delivery dates in december 20 of the purchase rights were converted to options with deliveries in 2010 and 2011 subsequent to yearend alaska converted one option and two purchase rights into firm orders for three additional b737800s to be delivered in 2007 and 2008 separate from the purchase agreement alaska has negotiated operating lease agreements for two additional b737800 aircraft to be delivered in late 2006 

  

in october 2005 horizon finalized an agreement to purchase 12 bombardier q400 aircraft with delivery dates beginning in december 2006 and continuing through july 2007 this agreement in part replaced firm orders for seven crj700 aircraft that were to be delivered over the next several years this agreement also provides for an option to purchase up to an additional 20 q400 aircraft in connection with the agreement bombardier agreed to provide certain remarketing assistance for up to 12 q200 aircraft currently leased by horizon for a fee as set forth in the agreement should horizon decide to sublease any or all of the 12 q200 aircraft it is reasonably likely that the sublease income including any support from bombardier would not be sufficient to cover our existing lease obligation and we would have an immediate recognition of the related loss on the sublease 

  

other events 

  

in october 2005 alaska finalized a 172 million variablerate predelivery payment facility to provide a portion of the predelivery funding requirements of alaska’s purchase of up to 38 new boeing 737800 aircraft 23 of which are firm orders under the current aircraft purchase agreement this facility will expire on august 31 2009 and the interest rate is based on onemonth libor plus a specified margin any borrowings will be secured by the company’s rights under the boeing purchase agreement 

  

we began daily nonstop service from los angeles to mexico city in august 2005 and from seattle to dallasfort worth in september 2005 

  

capacity outlook 

  

for 2006 alaska and horizon expect capacity increases of approximately 5 to 6 and 6 respectively the expected capacity increase at alaska is due largely to the return of the full schedule and the introduction of 12 new b737800 aircraft in 2006 with most of those coming later in the year horizon’s expected capacity increase is due largely to the annualization of increasing capacity of the q400 fleet from 70 to 74 seats and to the four q400 aircraft that will be delivered in 2006 including two used q400s to be delivered in february or march the addition of the aircraft deliveries in 2006 at both alaska and horizon will be used to increase frequency in our existing markets and to a lesser degree serve new markets 

  

alaska will continue to work toward operational excellence in 2006 to improve our ontime performance completion rates baggage handling and other important customerfacing operational measures as part of this initiative alaska will remain focused on improving the performance of the ramp services at the seattletacoma international airport 

  

results of operations 

  

2005 compared with 2004 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2005 was 59 million or 001 per diluted share versus a consolidated net loss of 153 million or 057 per diluted share in 2004 

  

our consolidated income loss before the accounting change for 2005 was 845 million compared 153 million in 2004 the 2005 results include certain items that impact the comparability of the years these items are discussed in the “year in review and current events” section beginning on page 23 our 2004 results also include certain items that impact comparability including severance charges of 534 million 318 million after tax an impairment charge of 402 million 267 million after tax related primarily to our boeing 737200c fleet marktomarket hedging gains net of the reclassification of previously recorded marktomarket gains for settled hedges of 569 million 317 million after tax and a navigation fee refund of 110 million 63 million after tax excluding those items consolidated income before the accounting change would have been 550 million in 2005 compared to 52 million in 2004 the yearoveryear improvement can be characterized by higher revenues offset by slightly higher nonfuel operating costs and significantly higher fuel costs 

  

financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 18 and 19 respectively on pages 20 through 22 we have included a reconciliation of reported nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

  

alaska airlines revenues 

  

operating revenues increased 1831 million or 82 during 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an 81 increase in operating revenue per available seat mile rasm on relatively flat capacity the increase in rasm was driven by a 35 increase in ticket yields that resulted from an increase in ticket prices designed to offset higher fuel prices higher load factors and higher freight mail and other revenues the flat capacity is primarily a direct result of the reduction in our summer flight schedule that was announced in june 2005 offset by the addition of three b737800 aircraft during the year 

  

load factor increased 30 percentage points to a record 759 for 2005 due primarily to an increase in passenger traffic the yield environment is currently strong in 2006 yield improvement is expected to come from year over year increases in fares particularly in the first half of 2006 and to a lesser extent a new 10 fee that will be charged to customers that book travel through our reservation call centers 

  

freight and mail revenues increased by 39 million or 45 compared to 2004 as a result of a mail contract we have in the state of alaska that began in the third quarter of 2004 and fuel surcharges added to our freight services during the third quarter of 2005 offset by lower freight volumes 

  

othernet revenues increased 198 million or 161 due largely to an increase in mileage plan revenues resulting from higher award redemption on our partner airlines and an increase in cash receipts from miles sold of which a portion is recognized immediately as other revenue and an increase in our revenues from service to dutch harbor which is operated by a third party 

  

alaska airlines expenses 

  

in 2005 total operating expenses increased 1085 million or 47 compared to 2004 operating expenses per asm increased 46 from 1041 cents in 2004 to 1089 cents in 2005 the increase in operating expenses is due largely to the significant increase in raw or “intoplane” fuel costs and increases in aircraft maintenance contracted services landing fees and other rentals and other offset by declines in wages and benefits food and beverage service selling expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring charges and the impairment charge in 2004 related to our boeing 737200c fleet operating expenses per asm excluding fuel the navigation fee refund restructuring and impairment charges increased 11 compared to 2004 our current estimates of costs per asm excluding fuel for the first quarter and full year of 2006 are 835 cents and 765 cents respectively 

  

explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the yearoveryear decline in wages and benefits was partially offset by the following 

  

   

   

overall the reduction in wages and benefits costs are partially offset by increases in contracted services and maintenance expense due to the subcontracting of certain operations we expect to continue to see yearoveryear declines in wages throughout 2006 although to a lesser extent than in 2005 

  

   

   

in the second quarter of 2005 we entered into a fuel contract whereby the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices is fixed for approximately onethird of our fuel consumption through april 2006 this contract resulted in approximately 10 million in savings for alaska during 2005 

  

see page 21 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by alaska the economic cost per gallon the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including hedging gains recorded in aircraft fuel and fuel cost per gallon excluding all hedging activities 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

horizon air revenues 

  

in 2005 operating revenues increased 532 million or 106 compared to 2004 this increase is due largely to the increased capacity in both the horizonbrand flying and contract flying for frontier airlines which began in january 2004 combined with the slight increase in operating revenues per available seat mile rasm the increase in rasm was primarily due to an increase in load factors partially offset by a 28 decline in ticket yields 

  

load factor increased 35 percentage points to 728 for 2005 due primarily to the 148 increase in passenger traffic outpacing the 94 increase in capacity the increases in passenger traffic and capacity are primarily due to increased contract flying with frontier the harmonization flying with alaska the addition of one crj700 in 2005 and four additional seats on each of our q400s contract flying with frontier represented approximately 93 of passenger revenues and 229 of capacity during 2005 compared to 91 and 214 respectively in 2004 

  

horizon air expenses 

  

operating expenses for 2005 increased 563 million or 114 compared to 2004 operating expenses per asm increased 18 compared to 2004 operating expenses per asm excluding fuel and impairment charges decreased 17 compared to 2004 our estimates of costs per asm excluding fuel for the first quarter and full year of 2006 are 144 cents and 140 cents respectively 

  

explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

   

   

   

see page 22 for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by horizon the economic cost per gallon the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including hedging gains recorded in aircraft fuel and fuel cost per gallon excluding all hedging activities 

  

   

   

   

   

   

consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  

net nonoperating income was 1446 million in 2005 compared to 592 million in 2004 interest income increased 64 million due primarily to improved returns and a slightly larger average marketable securities portfolio in 2005 offset by a larger interest payment in 2004 related to the navigation fee refund interest expense increased 111 million due to interest rate increases on our variablerate debt and the changes to some of our variablerate debt agreements to slightly higher fixedrate agreements capitalized interest increased 72 million from 17 million in 2004 to 89 million in 2005 this increase is due to the significant increase in deposits for future flight equipment resulting from our new aircraft purchase agreements for boeing 737800 and bombardier q400 aircraft 

  

fuel hedging gains include 1122 million in gains from fuel hedging contracts settled in 2005 compared to 286 million in 2004 in addition fuelhedging gains include net marktomarket gains on unsettled hedge contracts net of the reclassification of previously recorded marktomarket gains for settled hedges of 617 million in 2005 and 569 million in 2004 

  

consolidated income tax expense benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax rate on pretax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for 2005 was 384 compared to an effective income tax rate of 257 on a pretax loss in 2004 due to 

  

the magnitude of nondeductible expense such as employee per diem costs relative to a marginal pretax profit or loss a relatively small change in pretax results may cause a significant change in the effective tax rate we applied our 2005 marginal rate of 375 to the cumulative effect of the accounting change 

  

2004 compared with 2003 

  

our consolidated net loss for 2004 was 153 million or 057 per share versus net income of 135 million or 051 per share in 2003 the 2004 results include four significant items that impact the comparability to 2003 these items are discussed in the “results of operations 2005 compared with 2004” section beginning on page 27 our 2003 results also include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon or a combined 443 million net of tax received related to assistance from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 

  

our consolidated operating loss for 2004 was 798 million compared to a loss of 175 million for 2003 our consolidated pretax loss for 2004 was 206 million compared to pretax income of 290 million for 2003 

  

alaska airlines revenues 

  

operating revenues increased 2056 million or 101 during 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 the increase in revenues resulted from an 115 increase in passenger traffic offset by a 14 decline in ticket yields for the year ended december 31 2004 capacity increased 71 as compared to 2003 the capacity increases are primarily due to the annualization and expansion of our transcontinental flying including service from seattle to chicago and los angeles to reagan national in washington dc the traffic increase of 115 outpaced the capacity increase of 71 resulting in an increase in load factor from 700 to 729 the decline in yield per passenger mile was a result of continued industrywide pricing pressure particularly in the fourth quarter where yield declines were more substantial dropping 58 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

freight and mail revenues increased 91 million or 118 because of a new mail contract we have in the state of alaska offset by lower freight revenues 

  

othernet revenues increased 133 million or 121 due largely to revenues from service to dutch harbor which is operated by a third party that began in january of 2004 and higher mileage plan revenues 

  

alaska airlines expenses 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 total operating expenses increased 2716 million or 133 as compared to the same period in 2003 operating expenses per asm increased 58 from 984 cents in 2003 to 1041 cents in 2004 the increase in operating expenses per asm is due largely to significant increase in fuel costs our restructuring charges the impairment charge related to our boeing 737200 fleet higher wages and benefits contracted services costs and landing fees and other rental costs offset by declines in selling expenses and the navigation fee recovery operating expense per asm excluding fuel the navigation fee recovery restructuring and impairment charges decreased 50 to 792 cents per asm compared to 834 cents per asm in 2003 explanations of significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

   

benefits costs were favorably impacted by a 73 million reduction in workers compensation expense resulting from positive workers compensation claims experience at alaska and a related reduction to ultimate loss estimates recorded in december totaling 66 million in total benefits costs were flat year over year 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

horizon air revenues 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 operating revenues increased 394 million or 85 as compared to 2003 this increase is due largely to the increased traffic in our native network and our new contract flying for frontier airlines which began january 1 2004 partially offset by a decline in the incentive payments made by alaska to horizon incentive payments are eliminated in consolidation 

  

the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of expected costs plus a base markup and certain incentives however since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel landing fees marketing costs and station labor and rents revenue per asm cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon’s native network flying 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 capacity increased 209 and traffic was up 314 compared to the same period in 2003 contract flying with frontier represented approximately 91 of passenger revenues and 214 of capacity during 2004 passenger load factor increased 54 percentage points to 693 passenger yield decreased 161 to 2261 cents reflecting the inclusion of the frontier contract flying the yield for which is 

  

significantly lower than native network flying and a decline in incentive payments from alaska for feed traffic contract revenue and higher yields in horizon’s native network combined with the increases in traffic resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of 450 million or 102 

  

horizon air expenses 

  

operating expenses increased 368 million or 81 as compared to the same period in 2003 operating expenses per asm including fuel and the impairment charge decreased 105 as compared to 2003 operating expenses per asm excluding fuel and the impairment charge decreased 141 as compared to the same period in 2003 operating expenses in 2004 include 34 million related to an impairment charge on our heldforsale f28 aircraft and spare engines to lower the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value explanations of other significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

consolidated nonoperating income expense  

  

net nonoperating income was 592 million in 2004 compared to 465 million in 2003 interest income increased 117 million due to a larger marketable securities portfolio in 2004 combined with a correction of premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities portfolio in 2003 2004 interest income also includes 33 million from the recovery in 2004 of disputed mexico navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003 interest expense net of capitalized interest increased 47 million due to increases in debt balances as compared to 2003 

  

fuel hedging gains include 286 million and 64 million in gains from settled fuel hedging contracts in 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition fuelhedging gains include marktomarket gains on unsettled hedge contracts net of the reclassification of previously recorded marktomarket gains for settled hedges of 569 million in 2004 

  

the 2003 results include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon received in connection with the government reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 

  

consolidated income tax benefit 

  

our consolidated effective income tax benefit rate for 2004 was 257 compared to an effective income tax expense rate of 534 in 2003 due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee per diem costs relative to pretax profit or loss a relatively small change in pretax results can cause a significant change in the effective tax rate 

  

change in accounting policy 

  

effective january 1 2005 we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method under the former method these costs were capitalized and amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term under the direct expense method overhaul costs are expensed as incurred we believe that the direct expense method is preferable because it eliminates the judgment and estimation needed to determine overhaul versus repair allocations in maintenance activities additionally our approved maintenance program for the majority of our airframes now focuses more on shorter but more frequent maintenance visits we also believe that the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry accordingly effective january 1 2005 we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft resulting in a charge of 1447 million pretax 904 million after tax we do not believe disclosing the effect of adopting the direct expense method on net income for 2005 provides meaningful information because of changes in our maintenance program including the execution of a “powerbythehour” engine maintenance agreement with a third party in late 2004 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following critical accounting estimates we have discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

  

mileage plan 

  

our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our credit card partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel therefore for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on other airlines 

  

at december 31 2005 we had approximately 95 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability of 4668 million the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption impacts the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

  

1  the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel 

  

members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel therefore based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts we estimate how many miles will never be used “breakage” and do not record a liability for those miles our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members’ accounts account balances and other factors we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable a hypothetical 10 change in our 

  

estimate of breakage currently 12 in the aggregate has approximately a 52 million affect on the liability however actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates given the dynamic nature of the program and our inability to predict our members’ future behavior 

  

2  the number of miles used per award ie free ticket 

  

we estimate how many miles will be used per award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska horizon or other airlines 

  

3  the costs that will be incurred to provide travel 

  

when the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket incremental costs such as food fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 

  

4 the number of awards redeemed for travel on alaska or horizon versus other airlines 

  

the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines we estimate the number of awards which will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus other airlines and accrue the costs on this based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 

  

5 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles 

  

we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel as fare levels change our deferral rate changes which may result in more or less recognition of cash proceeds in any given quarter 

  

we review mileage plan estimates each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

pension plans 

  

we account for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 87 “employer’s accounting for pensions” under sfas no 87 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods pension expense calculated under sfas no 87 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans of 717 million 783 million and 735 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions at december 31 2005 the fair value of our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets totaled 6809 million we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately 50 million during 2006 

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases as of january 1 2006 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 775 this rate is slightly lower than the assumed rate of 80 used for the 2005 pension expense and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2005 is based on an allocation of us and nonus equities and us fixed income securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 775 to 725 would increase our estimated 2006 pension expense by approximately 36 million 

  

pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 550 and 575 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality longterm bonds decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 550 to 500 would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at december 31 2005 by approximately 567 million and increase estimated 2006 pension expense by approximately 80 million 

  

the defined benefit plan for management personnel was closed to new entrants in 2003 we are working to restructure the defined benefit plans for other labor groups any such change could impact future pension expense and pension liabilities 

  

future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

  

subsequent to december 31 2005 the financial accounting standards board began to work on an exposure draft that would require balance sheet recognition of the full unfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans for years ending after december 15 2006 for us this would be effective at december 31 2006 this change in the accounting for pension and postretirement benefits will likely result in a significant charge to our accumulated other comprehensive income as we will be required to recognize the unfunded status based on the projected benefit obligation rather than the accumulated benefit obligation the exposure draft is expected in march 2006 

  

longlived assets 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 20 billion of property and equipment and related assets in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets changes in fleet plans the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets management decisions regarding the future use of the assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

  

as part of our simplification and unit cost reduction initiatives we may seek to accelerate the retirement of our md80 fleet in the future although no decision has been made we expect to look closely at this option during the first quarter of 2006 and discuss it with our board of directors if we make a decision to exit this fleet type we would likely have to make substantial lease termination payments to lessors for our 11 leased md80 aircraft and we believe that we would incur a loss upon disposal of our 15 owned md80 aircraft as the carrying value of those aircraft exceeds the current market value this loss would be recognized as an impairment charge if and when any such decision is made the market value of md80 aircraft fluctuates and is highly dependent on factors out of our control including the number of aircraft available in the market and fleet changes by other airlines and demand for those aircraft by other carriers as of december 31 2005 our 15 owned md80s have a combined net book value of approximately 205 million and we believe the current market value is in the range of 50 million to 80 million 

  

in 2003 and 2004 due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations except as related to the b737200c fleet and horizon’s idle fokker f28 aircraft and spare engines in 2004 see note 14 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test if cash flows do not materialize as estimated there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 

  

workers compensation and employee health care accruals 

  

the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends our workers compensation and employee health care accruals totaled 344 million at december 31 2005 compared to 297 million at december 31 2004 

  

realizability of deferred tax assets 

  

the company has a net deferred tax liability of 646 million at december 31 2005 which includes gross deferred tax assets of 4237 million offset by a gross deferred tax liability of 4883 million in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the available evidence we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2005 our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income should we incur additional losses in the future our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

  

   

during the year ended december 31 2005 our cash and marketable securities increased 1087 million to 9826 million this increase reflects cash provided by operating activities of 2719 million and cash provided by financing activities of 2548 million resulting primarily from 2000 million in net proceeds from the sale of 57 million shares of our common stock and a large volume of option exercises offset by cash used for property and equipment additions net of aircraft deposit returns and proceeds from asset dispositions of 4104 million and net purchases of marketable securities of 631 million 

  

cash provided by operating activities 

  

during 2005 net cash provided by operating activities was 2719 million compared to 3340 million during 2004 the decrease is due largely to the cash payments made for severance a 427 million tax refund in 2004 and significantly higher fuel costs offset by improved revenues in the current year 

  

cash used in investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 4811 million during 2005 compared to 3920 million in 2004 we had net purchases of 631 million of marketable securities and 4104 million for property and equipment additions net of aircraft deposit returns and proceeds from asset dispositions during 2005 our aircraft related capital expenditures net of aircraft deposit returns and proceeds from asset dispositions increased 2553 million compared to 2004 primarily reflecting the net payment of 1012 million related to the aircraft purchase commitment entered into during the second quarter of 2005 to acquire 35 boeing 737800 aircraft as well as additional scheduled predelivery payments as of january 1 2005 we no longer have capital expenditures related to overhauls as those maintenance activities are expensed as incurred under our maintenance accounting policy adopted on that date we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 510 million of which 400 million is expected to be newaircraft related in 2006 as we take delivery of several new aircraft 

  

cash provided by used in financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 2548 million during 2005 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1069 million during 2004 in the fourth quarter of 2005 we issued 57 million shares of our common stock for proceeds of 2000 million net of underwriting discounts and professional fees horizon had one debt issuance during 2005 of 200 million which is secured by flight equipment and has a term of 15 years alaska borrowed 738 million against its predelivery payment facility discussed below debt issuances and proceeds from common stock during the period were offset by normal longterm debt payments of 542 million 

  

we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand at december 31 2005 totaling 9826 million along with proceeds from our new predelivery payment facility used to provide assistance with our predelivery funding requirements on the purchase of new b737800 aircraft and additional debt financing we have debt financing arranged for all of our firm 2006 b737800 deliveries and are currently negotiating the financing on the q400s we also have restricted cash of 41 million which is intended to collateralize interest payments due through march 2006 on our 150 million floating rate senior convertible notes due 2023 issued in 2003 

  

bank line of credit facility 

  

alaska has a 160 million variablerate credit facility that expires in march 2008 as of december 31 2005 there are no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and the company has no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility see note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

predelivery payment facility 

  

on october 19 2005 alaska finalized a 172 million variablerate revolving loan facility with a syndicate of lenders to provide a portion of the predelivery funding requirements of alaska’s purchase of up to 38 new boeing 737800 aircraft 23 of which are firm orders under the current aircraft purchase agreement the facility will expire on august 31 2009 the interest rate is based on onemonth libor plus a specified margin any borrowings will be secured by alaska’s rights under the boeing purchase agreement the principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid at the time that alaska takes delivery of the aircraft likely using proceeds from longterm debt financing on those aircraft we expect to fund additional predelivery payments throughout 2006 and beyond using this facility as of december 31 2005 738 million was outstanding 

  

convertible notes 

  

in 2003 alaska air group completed the private placement of 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 the notes 

  

as noted in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements where these notes are discussed further we have the option of calling the notes in march 2006 based on the recent market price of our common stock it is possible that we would call the notes at that time however no decision has been made if we do not call the notes we have not yet determined how each payment of principal or interest due will be funded in the future we anticipate that these payments will be funded either by dividends distributions loans advances or other payments from our subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by alaska air group any such payments by our subsidiaries to air group could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 

  

supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing activities 

  

we received a 97 million credit toward our purchase deposits related to the aircraft purchase agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2005 this credit was recorded as additional purchase deposits and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and will be applied to future aircraft upon delivery 

  

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

aircraft purchase commitments 

  

at december 31 2005 we had firm orders for 48 firm aircraft purchase orders requiring aggregate payments of approximately 11735 million as set forth below in addition alaska has entered into an operating lease agreement with a third party to take delivery of two b737800 aircraft in late 2006 alaska had options to acquire 35 additional b737s and purchase rights for 30 more and horizon had options to acquire 20 q400s and 17 crj700s subsequent to yearend alaska converted one option and two purchase rights into firm orders for three additional b737800s to be delivered in 2007 and 2008 additionally horizon executed purchase agreements for two used q400 aircraft to be delivered in february or march of 2006 total purchase price for these two aircraft was approximately 210 million alaska and horizon expect to finance the firm orders and to the extent exercised the option aircraft with leases longterm debt or internally generated cash 

  

the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year as of december 31 2005 

  

   

the crj700 was delivered in january 2006 and was paid for with cash on hand the two q400 aircraft will be delivered in december 2006 and financing has not yet been determined the 10 b737800 aircraft are to be delivered throughout 2006 beginning in february financing for all of the 2006 b737800 aircraft deliveries has been arranged in addition to the 10 firm orders noted above alaska has lease agreements in place for two b737800 aircraft that will be delivered in november and december of 2006 our first b737800 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2006 was delivered in february and was financed with 315 million of fixedrate debt 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2005 this table excludes contributions to our various pension plans which we expect to be approximately 50 million to 70 million per year through 2009 

  

       

new accounting standards 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas 123r “share based payment an amendment of sfas nos 123 and 95” the new standard requires companies to recognize as expense the fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees as of the grant date this new standard will apply both to stock options that we grant to employees and to our employee stock purchase plan which features a lookback provision and allows employees to purchase stock at a 15 discount our options are typically granted with ratable vesting provisions and we intend to amortize compensation cost over the service period using the straightline method sfas 123r was effective january 1 2006 we will use the “modified prospective method” upon adoption whereby previously awarded but unvested equity awards are accounted for in accordance with sfas 123r and prospective amounts are recognized in the income statement instead of simply being disclosed once adopted we expect our stockbased compensation expense as measured under sfas 123r will be approximately 7 million to 9 million per year on a pretax basis of which 3 million to 5 million will be for stockbased compensation that has not historically been recorded in our statements of operations 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” fin 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2005 and has had no significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas no 154” sfas no 154 requires retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle unless impracticable or a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions sfas no 154 also requires that a change in depreciation amortization or depletion method for longlived nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle this statement carries forward the guidance in apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” for the reporting of the correction of an error and a change in accounting estimate sfas no 154 is effective beginning january 1 2006 sfas no 154 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in june 2005 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on eitf issue no 056 “determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination” “eitf 056” eitf 056 requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased eitf 056 was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2005 eitf 056 did not have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in march 2004 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” eitf 031 the guidance prescribes a threestep model for determining whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments the accounting guidance became effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2004 while the disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2004 in september 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf 0311 “effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments “fsp eitf 03011 fsp eitf 03011 delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 1020 of eitf 0301 in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this statement specifically nullifies the requirements of paragraphs 1018 of eitf 031 and references existing otherthantemporary impairment guidance the guidance under this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 at december 31 2005 availableforsale investments in the company’s marketable securities portfolio had unrealized losses totaling 39 million which are recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income management does not believe that the securities with unrealized losses as of december 31 2005 meet the criteria for recognizing the loss under existing otherthantemporary guidance 

  

effect of inflation and price changes 

  

inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income 

  

risk factors 

  

if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the nature of competition in our markets changes 

  

the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares flight frequency frequent flyer benefits routes and service the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats recently airlines have reduced routes and the number of planes available which has resulted in reduced industry capacity and a trend towards increased fares if airlines decide to increase their capacity in the future this could cause fares to decline which may adversely affect our business and results of operations we currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company others are operating under bankruptcy court protection and may institute substantial fare discounts in order to maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty in addition competitors who successfully reorganize out of bankruptcy could have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor supply and financing agreements some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 

  

the airline industry particularly regional airlines also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives such as buses trains or automobiles in addition technology advancements may limit the desire for air travel for example video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may reduce the need for inperson communication and add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lowercost substitutes for air travel 

  

in addition the united states and mexico recently amended their bilateral agreement relating to commercial air service the amendments expand authorized service levels to cities we serve in mexico other airlines will likely seek to add service on some of the city pairs we currently serve which will increase competition and potentially negatively affect our results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices and variability of jet fuel further increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 

  

fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses comprising 24 and 19 of total operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively significant increases in fuel costs during 2004 and 2005 have negatively impacted our results of operations further increases would harm our financial condition and results of operations based on historical trends we estimate that a onecent increase in our economic price per gallon of fuel increases our fuel expenses by approximately 40 million annually 

  

historically fuel costs have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline in addition various events including natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita and hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere could result in reductions in the production or availability of crude oil or jet fuel and could result in increases in the cost of fuel because of the effect of any of these events on the price and availability of fuel the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty in the event of a fuel supply shortage higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result we may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher fares 

  

we utilize fuel hedges as a form of insurance against the volatility of fuel prices to manage the risk of fuel price increases we have entered into swap agreements and purchased call options that cap our fuel costs at designated perbarrel oil prices even with hedges we are substantially and increasingly exposed to increases in jet fuel costs since the amount of hedged consumption declines and the price at which we are hedged increases this means that even if fuel prices stay at current levels our economic fuel cost will increase in future years harming our business and results of operations unless we are able to offset these higher fuel prices through higher fares 

  

if we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals our financial condition may suffer 

  

we along with other airlines have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities for 2005 our nonfuel operating costs were slightly higher year over year and we expect those costs to decline somewhat in 2006 if we are unable to further reduce our nonfuel unit costs we would likely not be able to achieve our growth plan and our financial results may suffer 

  

we have incurred operating losses in each year since 2000 and may incur operating losses in the future in addition our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially 

  

in each year since 2000 we have incurred operating losses for the year ended december 31 2005 we incurred an operating loss of 74 million and prior to that we incurred operating losses of 798 million and 175 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively however in 2005 when considering the benefit from fuel hedges that settled during the period that are included in nonoperating income expense we would have had an operating profit of 1048 million the inability to sustain profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on commercial terms and to sustain and expand our business 

  

in addition our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and weather because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations due to these factors as well as other risk factors described in this prospectus quartertoquarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance in addition it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company in that event the price of air group’s common stock could decline perhaps substantially 

  

our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities 

  

we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings as of both december 31 2005 and 2004 we had approximately 1 billion of indebtedness outstanding approximately 859 million and 892 million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property in addition to longterm debt we have significant other fixed obligations under operating leases related to our aircraft airport terminal space other airport facilities and office space as of december 31 2005 future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately 934 million for 2006 through 2009 and an aggregate of 1 billion for the years thereafter 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had commitments totaling 12 billion to purchase 48 additional aircraft through 2011 we also had operating lease commitments for two aircraft to be delivered in 2006 we will incur additional debt and other fixed obligations as we take delivery of new aircraft and other equipment and if we are able to expand into new markets 

  

our outstanding indebtedness and other fixed obligations could have important consequences for example they could 

  

   

   

   

our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other fixed obligations will depend on our future operating performance and cash flow which in turn will depend on prevailing economic and political conditions and financial competitive regulatory business and other factors many of which are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due and if we fail to do so our business could be harmed if we are unable to make payments on our debt and other fixed obligations we could be forced to renegotiate those obligations or obtain additional equity or debt financing to the extent we finance our activities with additional debt we may become subject to financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our growth strategy we cannot assure you that our renegotiation efforts would be successful or timely or that we could refinance our obligations on acceptable terms if at all 

  

we may not be able to obtain or secure financing for our new aircraft 

  

as of december 31 2005 we had commitments to purchase 48 new aircraft through 2011 we have secured financing for a portion of those aircraft to complete the purchase of the remaining aircraft which we intend to do to replace retiring aircraft and to grow our fleet we must secure financing which we may not be able to do on acceptable terms or at all there can be no guarantee that additional financing will be available when required our inability to secure the financing could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances or result in delays in or our inability to take delivery of aircraft which would impair our growth plans 

  

our failure to successfully implement alaska’s growth strategy could harm our business 

  

alaska’s growth strategy involves adding additional boeing 737800 aircraft increasing the frequency of flights to markets we currently serve expanding into new markets and increasing flight connection opportunities it is critical that we achieve our growth strategy in order for our business to attain economies of scale and to sustain or improve our results of operations we may need to obtain additional gates and other operational facilities at our key airports in order to increase the frequency of our flights to these airports increasing the number of markets we serve depends on our ability to access suitable airports located in our targeted geographic markets in a manner that is consistent with our cost strategy any condition that would deny limit or delay our access to airports we serve or seek to serve in the future will constrain our ability to grow expansion will also require additional skilled personnel equipment and facilities our inability to hire and retain skilled personnel or to secure the required equipment and facilities efficiently and costeffectively may negatively affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our existing markets establish new markets or increase our flight connection opportunities and our failure to do so could harm our business 

  

growth of our fleet and expansion of our markets and services may also strain our existing management resources and systems to the point that they may no longer be adequate to support our operations requiring us to make significant expenditures in these areas we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently develop our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis and the failure to do so could harm our business 

  

a significant change to our fleet could negatively affect our financial performance 

  

alaska currently operates a fleet of 84 boeing 737 aircraft and 26 md80 aircraft the md80 aircraft have an average age of nearly 14 years the longest of any of our fleet types with the exception of the b737200c aircraft which are scheduled to be retired by the end of 2007 generally older aircraft have higher maintenance costs consume more fuel and have lower reliability and customer acceptance than newer aircraft in addition having a mixed fleet of md80 and b737 aircraft adds operational complexity results in higher crew and training costs and drives the need for more inventory parts 

  

although no decision has been made as part of our simplification and unit cost reduction initiatives we may seek to accelerate the retirement of our md80 fleet in the future we expect to look closely at this option during the first quarter of 2006 and discuss it with our board of directors if we make a decision to exit this fleet type we would likely have to make substantial lease termination payments to lessors of the 11 leased md80 aircraft which could negatively impact our financial performance in addition we believe that we would incur a loss upon disposal of owned md80 aircraft as the carrying value of those aircraft exceeds the current market value this loss would be recognized as an impairment charge if and when any such decision is made and would thus have an adverse impact on our shareholders’ equity the market value of md80 aircraft fluctuates and is highly dependent on factors out of our control including the number of aircraft available in the market and fleet changes by other airlines and demand for those aircraft by other carriers as of december 31 2005 our 15 owned md80s have a combined net book value of approximately 205 million 

  

if alaska fails to comply with financial covenants some of its financing agreements may be terminated 

  

alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements for example on march 25 2005 alaska entered into a 160 million revolving credit facility which contains certain restrictive financial covenants such as a minimum level of net worth covenant a maximum level of debt and leases to net worth covenant and a minimum level of fixed charge coverage covenant we cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs alaska’s inability to comply with the required financial covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and could result in a cross default under alaska’s other financing agreements in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable air group or alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if such financing were not available alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession which could harm our business 

  

a downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt 

  

in the past air group’s credit ratings were downgraded by both sp and moody’s we cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline in the future if any of our ratings decline this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices if any of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain 

  

we depend on a few key markets to be successful 

  

our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub in 2005 traffic to and from seattle accounted for 62 of our total traffic 

  

we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions as a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets such as adverse changes in local economic conditions negative public perception about our product or significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

weakness in the general economy and in the airline industry in particular could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we believe that airline traffic including business traffic is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations low ticket yields and escalating fuel prices contributed to much of the airline industry suffering significant losses from 2001 through 2004 in addition the war in iraq or other conflicts or events in the middle east or elsewhere may impact the economy and result in an adverse impact on the airline business similarly an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or avian flu could have a material adverse impact on the airline industry any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of these factors would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks negatively impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks or other hostilities involving the us may significantly harm our industry and our business in the future 

  

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry including our company because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the shortterm we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry including us and could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our insurance costs dramatically increased immediately following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs would harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

immediately following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for thirdparty claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events to 50 million per event and in the aggregate in light of this development under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act and the homeland security act of 2002 as most recently amended by the consolidated appropriations act of 2006 the government continues to offer domestic airlines either i thirdparty liability war risk coverage above 50 million or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance full hull comprehensive and thirdparty liability war risk coverage this coverage provides for the same limits of war and allied perils coverage for hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of thirdparty liability insurance carried by the airline on september 11 2001 

  

although our insurance costs have decreased since the dramatic increase following september 11 2001 aviation insurers could increase their premiums again in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull comprehensive and thirdparty war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through august 31 2006 while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited including smaller aggregate limits and short cancellation periods ie 7 days or in the case of certain events a lesser period including immediate termination significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a failure to negotiate new agreements or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our competitors could disrupt our business and increase our costs 

  

as of december 31 2005 labor unions represented approximately 84 of alaska’s and 46 of horizon’s employees labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses comprising approximately 31 and 35 of our total operating expenses in 2005 and 2004 respectively each of our different represented employee groups has separate collective bargaining agreements and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability three of these agreements are currently subject to mediated negotiations through the national labor relations act process if we are unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages we could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business in the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed in addition to the extent we are unable to maintain the outsourcing or subcontracting of certain services for our business we would incur substantial costs including costs associated with hiring new employees in order to perform these services inhouse 

  

our continuing obligation to fund our traditional pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace because some of our competitors have either eliminated such obligations through bankruptcy or never had traditional pension plans in place we operate in a highly competitive industry and our high labor costs or any increases to these costs could affect our ability to compete 

  

our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs 

  

we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

  

our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 

  

an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public in addition we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities 

  

we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of our cost control efforts our reliance on outside vendors has recently increased and may continue to do so in september 2004 alaska began subcontracting the remainder of its heavy aircraft maintenance to outside vendors in addition alaska retained outside suppliers for fleet service and facilities maintenance in may 2005 alaska subcontracted out its ground handling services at seattletacoma airport to a vendor that provides similar services to alaska and other carriers at many other locations 

  

our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all although we monitor our vendors for quality control if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline in late 2005 and early 2006 alaska experienced a number of negative press reports following several aircraft incidents in seattle the company has taken steps to increase supervision and training of vendor personnel in order to reduce the risk of further incidents and negative publicity vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

  

our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including traffic congestion at airports weather conditions and increased security measures any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

like other airlines our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control including air traffic congestion at airports adverse weather conditions and increased security measures including measures imposed in response to security breaches delays frustrate passengers reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs all of which in turn affect our profitability during periods of fog snow rain freezing rain storms or other adverse weather conditions flights may be canceled or significantly delayed due to our geographic area of operations we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors cancellations or delays due to weather conditions traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

  

increases in government taxes and fees could reduce demand for air travel and harm our business 

  

airlines pay or are responsible for collecting a number of different taxes and fees including but not limited to airport facility charges immigration fees security fees excise taxes on ticket sales and fuel taxes we believe the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to fare levels although law makers may impose additional fees and view them as “passthrough costs” we believe that a higher total ticket price in the eyes of the consumer will influence their purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

  

moreover we believe that the impact of higher fixedrate fees is proportionally greater for low fare carriers carriers with a high percentage of leisure travelers and carriers that fly relatively short segments because alaska carries many leisure travelers and horizon flies many short haul segments we believe higher security fees and other fee increases generally could negatively impact air group more than some of our competitors 

  

changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 

  

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the us department of transportation the transportation security administration and the federal aviation administration the “faa” have issued regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures for example the faa has issued regulations covering among other things security measures collision avoidance systems noise abatement environmental restrictions safety procedures and maintenance regulations similarly many aspects of an airline’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment additionally because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september 11 2001 many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel if adopted these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices reducing revenue andor increasing costs 

  

we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business 

  

we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our computerized airline reservation system our telecommunication systems and our website we also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline in addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data increase our expenses and possibly cause us to temporarily cease our operations 

  

we rely on partner airlines for code share and frequent flyer marketing arrangements 

  

alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or “partners” including but not limited to american airlines continental airlines delta airlines and northwest airlines these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner “codeshare” flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights in addition the agreements generally provide that members of alaska’s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem 

  

miles for partner flights and vice versa we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under code share arrangements in addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative impact on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan which we believe is a source of competitive advantage in september 2005 both northwest and delta filed for protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code either carrier could propose plans of reorganization that would seek to modify or terminate some or all of these agreements 

  

we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircrafts and parts 

  

alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier as a result we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircrafts and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft carriers that operate a more diversified fleet are better positioned than we are to manage such events 

  

horizon’s results are partly dependent on frontier jetexpress which is dependent on frontier airlines 

  

horizon operates regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a 12year agreement with frontier airlines that began in january 2004 currently this service represents approximately 23 of horizon’s total capacity and approximately 9 of horizon’s passenger revenue under the arrangement frontier airlines pays horizon the expected costs of providing the service plus a base markup if frontier were to have financial difficulties and find it necessary to terminate the agreement we would have significant excess capacity that we would have to deploy elsewhere there can be no assurance that this excess capacity could be deployed in profitable markets and our unit operating costs would likely increase

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   

we have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio and commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy and other means we have market sensitive instruments in the form of fixedrate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

fuel prices 

  

we utilize derivative financial instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases see note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our hedge positions we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2005 would increase and decrease the fair value of our hedging portfolio by approximately 336 million and 327 million respectively 

  

please refer to pages 21 and 22 as well as to note 11 in the consolidated financial statements for company specific data on the results of our fuel hedging program 

  

financial market risk 

  

we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variablerate instruments which have exposure to changes in interest rates this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variablerate 

  

investment portfolio a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variablerate debt during 2005 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 27 million in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations we fixed the interest rates on several of our existing variablerate debt agreements in 2005 as a result our variablerate debt is approximately 44 of our total longterm debt at december 31 2005 compared to 65 at december 31 2004 

  

we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2005 interest income would increase by approximately 20 basis points

 item 1 business tableend general information 

  alaska air group inc air group or the company is a holding company that was incorporated in delaware in 1985 our two principal subsidiaries are alaska airlines inc alaska and horizon air industries inc horizon both subsidiaries operate as airlines although their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska is a major airline operates an alljet fleet and its average passenger trip length is 996 miles horizon is a regional airline operates jet and turboprop aircraft and its average passenger trip is 363 miles individual financial information for alaska and horizon is reported in note 12 to consolidated financial statements 

  air group’s executive offices are located at 19300 international boulevard seattle washington 98188 air group’s filings with the securities and exchange commission including its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge at wwwalaskaaircom  the information contained on our website is not a part of this annual report on form 10k as used in this form 10k the terms “air group” “our” “we” and the “company” refer to alaska air group inc and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise 

   alaska airlines inc is an alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 alaska principally serves 39 cities in six western states alaska washington oregon california nevada and arizona and canada and nine cities in mexico alaska also provides nonstop service between seattle and five eastern cities washington dc boston miami orlando and newark between seattle and denver seattle and chicago between los angeles and washington dc and between anchorage and chicago in each year since 1973 alaska has carried more passengers between alaska and the us mainland than any other airline in 2004 alaska carried 163 million revenue passengers passenger traffic within alaska and between alaska and the us mainland accounted for 20 of alaska’s 2004 revenue passenger miles west coast traffic including canada accounted for 53 the mexico markets accounted for 10 and other markets accounted for 17 based on passenger enplanements alaska’s leading airports are seattle los angeles portland and anchorage based on 2004 revenues its leading nonstop routes are seattleanchorage seattlelos angeles and seattlesan diego at december 31 2004 alaska’s operating fleet consisted of 108 jet aircraft 

   horizon air industries inc a washington corporation that first began service in 1981 was incorporated in 1982 and was acquired by air group in 1986 it is the largest regional airline in the pacific northwest and serves 40 cities in six states washington oregon montana idaho california and colorado and six cities in canada in 2004 horizon carried 59 million revenue passengers based on passenger enplanements horizon’s leading airports are seattle portland spokane and boise based on revenues in 2004 its leading nonstop routes are seattleportland seattlespokane seattlevancouver and seattlecalgary at december 31 2004 horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 18 jets and 47 turboprop aircraft with the jets providing 35 of the 2004 capacity except for those flights operating as frontier jetexpress horizon flights are listed under the alaska airlines designator code in airline reservation systems 

  on january 1 2004 horizon began operating regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a 12year agreement with frontier airlines service under this agreement became fully operational during the second quarter of 2004 and horizon is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the frontier jetexpress brand flying under this agreement represented 214 of horizon’s 2004 capacity and 91 of passenger revenues for the fourth quarter which is representative of ongoing operations flying under this agreement represented 231 of horizon’s fourth quarter capacity and 99 of passenger revenue 

3   the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of costs plus a base markup and certain incentives however since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel landing fees marketing costs and station labor and rents and combined with longer trip lengths revenue per asm cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon’s native network flying 

  alaska and horizon coordinate their flight schedules to provide service between any two points served by their systems in 2004 28 of horizon’s passengers connected to flights operated by alaska compared to 31 in 2003 we believe both airlines distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer service in the form of attention to customer needs advance seat assignments expedited checkin wellmaintained aircraft a firstclass section aboard alaska aircraft a generous frequent flyer program and other amenities 

   the airline industry is highly competitive airline results are sensitive to passenger demand ticket prices labor costs and fuel costs passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current events and industry capacity our industry was negatively impacted by weak economic conditions during 2001 2002 and the first half of 2003 the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and continued hostilities in the middle east economic conditions in the second half of 2003 and through 2004 improved somewhat resulting in stronger demand and higher traffic levels due to the industry’s high fixed costs in relation to revenue a small change in load factors or fare levels has a large impact on profits 

  labor costs generally make up 30 to 40 of an airlines’ total operating costs most major airlines including ours have employee groups who are represented by collective bargaining agents often airlines with unionized work forces have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward fast enough to respond to new competition our wage and benefit costs increased 3 in 2004 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2002 

  fuel prices generally make up 15 to 25 of an airline’s operating costs fuel prices can be volatile and largely uncontrollable in 2004 fuel prices increased significantly our economic fuel cost per gallon which is the net price we pay after the benefit of fuel hedges increased 39 and 14 in 2004 and 2003 respectively and decreased 10 in 2002 

  the industry is currently in a state of flux so called “low cost carriers” lccs have grown rapidly in recent years and currently enjoy a 30 share of total passengers carried in the united states because of their cost advantage lccs have contributed to an overall decline in ticket yields the lower yield environment coupled with high fuel costs has been problematic for the higher cost “legacy carriers” a number of which are operating under bankruptcy court protection because of the relatively low barriers to entry we expect the expansion of low cost and low fare carriers to continue some legacy carriers such as delta and united have launched their own low fare airlines song and ted we compete with many of these carriers now and expect to compete with additional entrants in the future 

  most major us carriers including alaska are working aggressively to cut operating costs including renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements and vendor agreements 

  as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in april 2003 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act the act was signed into legislation the act includes 23 billion of onetime cash payments to air carriers allocated based on each carrier’s share of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid to the transportation security administration tsa since its inception in february 2002 additionally passenger security fees were not imposed by the tsa and carrier fees were not paid during the period june 1 2003 through september 30 2003 in may 2003 we received our share of the onetime cash grant in the amount of 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon 

4 marketing and competition 

   alaska and horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and code sharing on certain flights as set forth below alliances enhance alaska’s and horizon’s revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage accrualredemption opportunities by gaining us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and by providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs our marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation if a significant agreement were terminated it could adversely impact revenues and increase the costs of our other marketing agreements most of our code share relationships are freesell code shares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk the table below identifies our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2004 

  

 

 

   competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry that are important to customers are 

 5 

   any domestic air carrier issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the department of transportation is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the united states together alaska and horizon carry approximately 32 of all us domestic passenger traffic alaska and horizon compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes including southwest airlines united airlines northwest airlines continental airlines american airlines delta airlines and regional affiliates associated with some of these carriers many of our competitors are substantially larger than alaska and horizon have greater financial resources and have more extensive route systems in addition continuing growth of lowcost carriers including southwest airlines airtran airways american trans air frontier airlines and jetblue airways in the united states places significant competitive pressures on us and other network carriers since they have the ability to charge a lower fare for travel between similar cities and thus exert downward pressure on yields due to its short haul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation including train bus and automobile transportation 

  we also compete with other airlines for skilled employees such as pilots flight attendants ramp service employees customer service agents and aircraft mechanics 

   airline tickets are distributed through three primary channels 

   we currently participate in all of these distribution channels but we cannot predict the terms on which we may be able to continue to participate in these or other sites or their effect on our ability to compete with other airlines 

employees 

  the airline business is labor intensive alaska and horizon had 10850 and 3734 respectively active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2004 wages salaries and benefits represented approximately 35 of our total operating expenses in 2004 

  at december 31 2004 labor unions represented 83 of alaska’s and 45 of horizon’s employees our relations with our labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act under this act the collective bargaining agreements between the respective airlines and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to appoint a federal mediator if no agreement is reached in mediation the national 

6 mediation board may declare that an impasse exists at which point the national mediation board proffers binding arbitration to the parties either party may decline to submit to arbitration if arbitration is rejected by either party a 30day “cooling off” period commences during that period a presidential emergency board may be established which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution the presidential emergency board process lasts for 30 days and is followed by a “cooling off” period of 30 days at the end of a “cooling off” period unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “selfhelp” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to replace strikers 

  two of alaska’s collective bargaining agreements contain provisions for interest arbitration under interest arbitration if the parties have not negotiated the contract by a predetermined date each side may submit a prescribed number of issues to binding arbitration the arbitrator’s decision on those issues is incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement and no strike or company “selfhelp” may occur 

  the collective bargaining agreement with the dispatchers is open for negotiation on wage rates in march 2005 if the parties are unable to reach an agreement there is an interest arbitration provision related only to wages 

  the pilot contract provides that if an agreement on the entire contract was not reached by december 15 2004 ten contract issues plus wage rates would be submitted to an interest arbitrator issues submitted generally relate to pension plans medical insurance profit sharing code sharing and work rules the parties did not reach an agreement and the issues have been submitted to binding arbitration in march 2005 with a decision to be effective in may 2005 the pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and nonwage issues

 regulation 

   the airline deregulation act of 1978 as amended eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation however the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration faa still exercise regulatory authority over air carriers in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the department of transportation subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us a certificate is of unlimited duration but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificate itself in addition the department of transportation maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international code share agreements alliance agreements between domestic major airlines international route authorities and certain consumer protection matters such as advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 

  the faa regulates aircraft operations generally including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of such aircraft ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls from time to time the faa issues airworthiness directives ads that must be incorporated into our aircraft we are and expect to be in compliance with all applicable requirements of these ads within the required time periods 

  the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements to the extent we continue to pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies 

  in november 2001 the aviation and transportation security act the security act was enacted the security act created a new government agency the transportation security administration tsa which is now part of the department of homeland security and is responsible for aviation security the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property including us mail cargo carryon and checked baggage and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft the tsa performs these functions with its own federal employees on december 31 2002 the tsa began explosive detection screening of all checked baggage  the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights 

  effective february 1 2002 the security act imposed a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay 

8 for these enhanced security measures in addition carriers are required to pay an additional amount to the tsa to cover the total cost of providing security measures equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 we paid 126 million 84 million and 99 million to the tsa for this security charge in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  recently the united states department of homeland security proposed raising the aviation security fee from 250 per oneway segment to 550 per oneway segment or maximum of 8 for a one way trip with multiple segments although fees and taxes are often viewed by lawmakers as pass through costs we believe that the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to price since all such increases affect the total ticket price paid by consumers we believe that they would reduce passenger traffic and could have a negative impact on our results 

  the department of transportation under its authority to prevent unfair competitive practices in the industry has from time to time considered the issuance of pricing and capacity rules that would limit major air carriers’ competitive response to new entrant carriers although the department of transportation has thus far declined to issue specific competitive guidelines it reiterated its intent to prevent what it considers to be unfair competitive practices in the industry and to pursue enforcement actions on a casebycase basis to the extent that future department of transportation enforcement actions either directly or indirectly impose restrictions upon our ability to respond to competitors our business may be adversely impacted conversely a relaxation in either unfair competition enforcement or restrictions could limit our ability to enter new markets or harm our operating results for markets that we have recently entered 

   airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the department of transportation maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve while air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets 

  legislation sometimes referred to as the “passengers’ bill of rights” has been discussed in congress and state legislatures this legislation could if enacted place various limitations on airline fares andor affect operating practices such as baggage handling and overbooking in 1999 we as well as other domestic airlines implemented a customer service plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to lowest fare availability delays cancellations and diversions baggage delivery and liability guaranteed fares and ticket refunds 

  to the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit our flexibility with respect to fares our revenue management system our operations or other aspects of our customer service operations our financial results could be adversely affected 

  fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we generally match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic during recent years a number of new lowcost airlines have entered the domestic market and several major airlines including alaska and horizon implemented efforts to lower their cost structures further fare reductions domestic and international may occur in the future if fare reductions are not offset by increases in passenger traffic cost reductions or changes in the mix of traffic that improves yields our operating results will be negatively impacted 

  in february 2004 alaska initiated a fare simplification plan whereby a number of restrictions were eliminated and the gap between the highest and lowest fares was reduced the goal of this initiative was to increase customer value and simplify the customer’s purchase decision by reducing the number of fares sold we believe this initiative was revenue neutral overall 

   heavily used airports may have restrictions with respect to the number of permitted takeoffs and landings the total permitted annual seat capacity to be operated at an airport the use or allocation of airport slots or other restrictions we currently have sufficient authorizations to operate our existing flights and have generally been able to obtain gates to expand our operations and change our schedules however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain authorizations for these purposes in the future or be able to do so on economical terms 

   we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration known as osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency or epa osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements we maintain our own continuing safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements 

  the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews the airport noise and capacity act generally requires faa approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date our operations could be adversely affected if such regulations become more restrictive or widespread 

  although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot assure you that new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate will not harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

fuel 

  our operations are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel fuel costs were approximately 19 of our total operating expenses in 2004 and 15 in 2003 fuel prices which can be volatile and which are outside of our control can have a significant impact on our operating results currently a onecent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 40 million we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft helps to mitigate the effect of high fuel prices 

  we purchase fuel hedge contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel due to the competitive nature of the airline industry airlines often are unable to pass on increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares conversely any potential benefit of lower fuel prices may be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues because of rising fuel prices our fuel hedging program has resulted in significant savings over the last three years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of our fuel hedging activities 

  while we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas there could be reductions in the production andor 

10 importation of crude oil and price increases which could adversely affect our business if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel our business would be adversely affected 

frequent flyer program 

  all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner telephone companies hotels and car rental agencies alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels or terminate the program 

  mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacitycontrolled seating mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity in that member’s account as of december 31 2004 and 2003 alaska estimated that 2493000 and 2353000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20000mile free roundtrip domestic ticket award threshold of those eligible awards alaska estimated that approximately 88 of those awards would ultimately be redeemed for the years 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 631000 606000 and 441000 roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 73 for 2004 87 for 2003 and 68 for 2002 of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon for each period for the years 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 212000 174000 and 174000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 

  for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a national bank that rewards users of its credit card alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided on alaska or another partner airline the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as other revenuenet for awards issued and flown on other airlines at december 31 2004 and 2003 the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 4093 million and 3360 million respectively the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits 

other information 

   our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operating income is generally lowest or loss the greatest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic and sometimes due to adverse weather conditions generally increases in the second quarter and generally reaches its highest level during the third quarter 

  the airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel debt service and rent the expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried and as a result a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor 

11 shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include 

   in addition seasonal variations in traffic various expenditures and weather affect our operating results from quarter to quarter given our high proportion of fixed costs seasonality can affect our profitability from quarter to quarter many of our areas of operations experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than some of our competitors particularly in the state of alaska and in the pacific northwest who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems 

  the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions fare initiatives fluctuations in fuel prices labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern 

  no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers consequently the loss of our largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

   we carry insurance for passenger liability property damage and hull insurance for damage to our aircraft in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice 

  as a result of the events of september 11 2001 aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for thirdparty liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general although insurance rates have declined they are still somewhat above preseptember 11 levels and will likely remain there for the foreseeable future 

  pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 as amended by the consolidated appropriations act 2005 the government has offered and we have accepted war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august 31 2005 

   we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military callup the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft

  the following table shows the trading range of alaska air group inc common stock on the new york stock exchange 

 

   in may 2004 we issued unregistered common stock to our board of directors as part of their annual director compensation pursuant to the alaska air group 2004 longterm incentive equity plan 

   the company has a shareholderapproved equity plan that enables the compensation committee of the board of directors to make awards of equitybased compensation which we believe are an important tool to attract and retain key employees 

15   the table below provides information as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year concerning securities authorized for issuance under current and former equity compensation plans 

   the shares to be issued under plans not approved by stockholders relate to the company’s 1997 longterm incentive equity plan this plan was adopted by the board of directors in 1997 and did not require stockholder approval because no grants to executive officers were allowed under the plan 

   the 1997 plan terminated on november 3 2002 and no further awards may be made awards granted before that date remain outstanding in accordance with their terms under the 1997 plan awards could be made to any employee of the company who was not a director or officer subject to the reporting requirements of section 16 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended awards could be made in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights sars or stock awards the 1997 plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors 

   the 2004 plan became effective on may 18 2004 and shall terminate on may 18 2014 unless otherwise terminated earlier by the board under the 2004 plan awards can be made to any board director executive officer or employee of the company awards can be made in the form of stock options sars or stock awards the compensation committee of the board of directors administers the 2004 plan 

  in addition the 2004 plan authorizes the granting of shares to board members according to the terms of the nonemployee director stock plan as described below 

   an aggregate of up to 25000 shares of common stock was authorized for issuance under the directors’ plan it remains in effect until all shares have been purchased or acquired or until terminated by the board 

  each member of the board of directors of the company who is not employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries is an eligible director each year on the first business day following that year’s annual meeting of stockholders a portion of an eligible director’s annual retainer for services as a director for the coming year is paid in shares of common stock having a total value of 5000 

  in addition each eligible director may elect to reduce his or her annual cash retainer and to receive instead a number of shares of common stock equal in value to the amount of the reduction on the same date the stock payment described above is made

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k all statements in the following discussion which are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors some of which we cannot predict or control for a discussion of our risk factors see “risk factors” beginning on page 41 

   alaska and horizon operate as airlines however their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska is a major airline serving primarily alaska the us west coast five cities on the us east coast denver chicago vancouver and calgary canada and mexico it operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 996 miles horizon operates both as a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest california and western canada and as a contract service provider to frontier airlines operating as frontier jetexpress out of denver horizon operates both jet and turboprop aircraft and its average passenger trip is 363 miles as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements beginning in 2004 horizon began operating regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under an agreement with frontier airlines which is described in more detail below 

   overall economic conditions in 2004 improved over 2003 the industry generally enjoyed increases in both passenger traffic and load factors and alaska and horizon were no different — posting record monthly load factors for much of the year however ticket yields continued to remain under pressure in the wake of growth of low cost carriers such as southwest and jetblue and excess capacity in many markets fuel prices reached record highs during much of the year although moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter but are still materially above historical averages these factors coupled with the high cost structures of many major carriers resulted in another year of significant losses for the industry 

  during 2004 the management team at alaska was actively focused on cost reductions our stated goal for 2004 was to achieve a unit cost excluding fuel and significant items of 80 cents per available seat mile asm and we achieved a full year unit cost excluding fuel and significant items of 792 cents per asm 

   during the third quarter of 2004 alaska announced a management reorganization and the closure of its oakland heavy maintenance base contracting out of related heavy maintenance contracting out of the company’s fleet service ground support equipment and facility maintenance functions maintenance shops and other initiatives in total we believe these restructuring activities will result in a reduction of approximately 900 employees when fully implemented in the first half of 2005 severance and related costs associated with this restructuring are estimated at 534 million of which 275 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2004 and 259 million was recorded in the fourth quarter we expect savings from these jobrelated initiatives to be approximately 35 million per year when fully implemented 

  as part of our ongoing cost saving initiatives we continue to look at all aspects of our business in 2005 we may outsource other activities or initiate other restructuring activities which would result in further restructuring charges 

   alaska airlines continues to pursue the restructuring of its labor agreements so that they are in line with what we believe to be the market our objectives as we restructure these agreements are to achieve market 

23 labor costs productivity and employee benefit costs based on these three objectives in 2003 alaska targeted 112 million per year of labor savings as a result of increases in our wage rates since that time combined with labor cost decreases achieved by our competitors we believe that our wages and benefits are now above market by approximately 125 million alaska believes that its pilot labor costs represent the majority of this amount despite ongoing negotiations in late 2003 and much of 2004 we were unable to reach a new agreement with the air line pilots association alpa and have therefore submitted to binding arbitration the decision of which will be effective in may 2005 the arbitration will cover wages plus five issues submitted by each of the company and alpa the pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and benefits nevertheless we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding particularly whether the arbitrator’s award will reflect cost savings in wage rates productivity and benefits equal to what we consider to be the current excess over market 

  reducing labor costs and finalizing the agreements with our labor groups is an important objective for 2005 

   beginning in the second quarter of 2004 we lost the ability to defer as a component of comprehensive income recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed we lost this ability because the price correlation between crude oil the commodity we use to hedge and west coast jet fuel fell below required thresholds for more discussion see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

  the implications of this change are twofold first our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market each quarterend and report the gain or loss in other nonoperating income or expense even though the actual consumption will take place in a future period second to a large extent the impact of our fuel hedge program will not be reflected in fuel expense for example we recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling 452 million during 2004 but only 166 million of that gain is reflected as an offset to fuel expense with the balance reported in other nonoperating income 

  we have provided information on marktomarket gains or losses as well as calculations of our economic fuel cost per gallon on pages 20 through 22 

  we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices 

   in june 2004 the company’s board approved a plan to accelerate the retirement of its boeing 737200c fleet and remove those aircraft from service earlier than initially planned in july 2004 the company announced its plan to replace these aircraft by modifying five existing 737400 aircraft and using other existing 737400 aircraft for the remaining passenger capacity at december 31 2004 the planned modifications have been delayed however management currently believes that all 737200s will still be retired by the end of 2007 as planned the company expects to replace the 737400s with boeing 737800 aircraft in 2005 and 2006 

  as a result of this decision the company evaluated impairment as required by sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” and concluded that the carrying value of the 737200c fleet was no longer recoverable when compared to the estimated remaining future cash flows accordingly during the second quarter of 2004 the company recorded an impairment charge totaling 368 million pretax to write down the fleet to its estimated fair market value in addition we revised our estimates of the useful lives and residual values of the fleet and related spare equipment and will depreciate the remaining carrying values through 2007 when the last aircraft will be retired 

   during the third quarter of 2004 we received a refund totaling 11 million pretax from the mexican government related to navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003 approximately 77 million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses and 33 million was recorded as nonoperating income 

   on january 1 2004 horizon began operating regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a 12year agreement with frontier airlines service under this agreement became fully operational during the second quarter of 2004 and horizon is currently operating nine regional jet aircraft under the frontier jetexpress brand flying under this agreement represented 214 of horizon’s 2004 capacity and 91 of passenger revenues for the fourth quarter which is more representative of ongoing operations flying under this agreement represented 231 of horizon’s fourth quarter capacity and 99 of passenger revenue 

  the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of costs plus a base markup and certain incentives however since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel landing fees marketing costs and station labor and rents and combined with longer trip lengths revenue per asm cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon’s native network flying 

   during the fourth quarter of 2004 alaska entered into a 10 year “powerbythehour” engine maintenance agreement with a third party under terms of this arrangement the third party will provide routine and major overhaul maintenance services on certain engines in our 737400 fleet at an agreed upon rate per hour flown 

  during the fourth quarter alaska added a row of seats to its 737400 fleet this change will result in an increase of approximately 23 in available seat miles on an annualized basis we expect this change will represent a significant portion of our capacity growth in 2005 in late 2004 we also announced that we would be installing winglets on our b737700 aircraft 

   for 2005 alaska and horizon expect capacity increases of approximately 3 and 12 respectively the expected capacity increase at alaska is due largely to the annualization of the additional seats added to the b737400 fleet and the addition of three b737800s offset by the retirement of two b737200s 

  horizon’s expected capacity increase is due largely to the annualization of aircraft additions in the first half of 2004 the addition of one new crj700 higher utilization resulting from the annualization of the contract flying for frontier in addition horizon will be adding a row of seats to the q400 fleet increasing capacity from 70 to 74 seats when complete this will result in an increase of approximately 15 in available seat miles on an annualized basis 

results of operations 

   our consolidated net loss for 2004 was 153 million or 057 per share versus net income of 135 million or 051 per share in 2003 the 2004 results include four significant items which impact the comparability to 2003 these items are discussed in the “year in review and current events” section beginning on page 29 our 2003 results also include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon or a combined 443 million net of tax or 166 per share received related to assistance from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 

  our consolidated operating loss for 2004 was 798 million compared to a loss of 175 million for 2003 our consolidated pretax loss for 2004 was 206 million compared to pretax income of 290 million for 

25 2003 financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 18 and 19 respectively on pages 20 through 22 we have included a reconciliation of reported nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

   operating revenues increased 2056 million or 101 during 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 the increase in revenues resulted from an 115 increase in passenger traffic offset by a 14 decline in ticket yields for the year ended december 31 2004 capacity increased 71 as compared to 2003 the capacity increases are primarily due to the annualization and expansion of our transcontinental flying including service from seattle to chicago and los angeles to reagan national in washington dc the traffic increase of 115 outpaced the capacity increase of 71 resulting in an increase in load factor from 700 to 729 the decline in yield per passenger mile was a result of continued industrywide pricing pressure particularly in the fourth quarter where yield declines were more substantial dropping 58 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 we expect that load factors will continue to be strong but that yields and passenger unit revenues will continue to decline on a yearoveryear basis into the first half of 2005 

  freight and mail revenues increased 91 million or 118 because of a new mail contract we have in the state of alaska offset by lower freight revenues 

  othernet revenues increased 133 million or 121 due largely to revenues received from an agreement with pen air to provide flight services to dutch harbor that began in january of 2004 and higher mileage plan revenues 

   for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 total operating expenses increased 2716 million or 133 as compared to the same period in 2003 operating expenses per asm increased 58 from 984 cents in 2003 to 1041 cents in 2004 the increase in operating expenses per asm is due largely to significant increase in fuel costs our restructuring charges the impairment charge related to our boeing 737200 fleet higher wages and benefits contracted services costs and landing fees and other rental costs offset by declines in other selling expenses and commissions and the navigation fee recovery operating expense per asm excluding fuel the navigation fee recovery restructuring and impairment charges decreased 5 to 792 cents per asm compared to 834 cents per asm in 2003 explanations of significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows

   for the year ended december 31 2004 operating revenues increased 394 million or 85 as compared to 2003 this increase is due largely to the increased traffic in our native network and our new contract flying for frontier airlines which began january 1 2004 partially offset by a decline in the incentive payments made by alaska to horizon incentive payments are eliminated in consolidation 

  the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of expected costs plus a base mark up and certain incentives however since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel landing fees marketing costs and station labor and rents revenue per asm cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon’s native network flying 

  for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 capacity increased 209 and traffic was up 314 compared to the same period in 2003 contract flying with frontier represented approximately 91 of passenger revenues and 214 of capacity during 2004 passenger load factor increased 54 percentage points to 693 passenger yield decreased 165 to 2250 cents reflecting the inclusion of the frontier contract flying the yield for which is significantly lower than native network flying and a decline in incentive payments from alaska for feed traffic contract revenue and higher yields in horizon’s native network combined with the increases in traffic resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of 425 million or 96 

   operating expenses increased 368 million or 81 as compared to the same period in 2003 operating expenses per asm including fuel and the impairment charge decreased 105 as compared to 2003 operating expenses per asm excluding fuel and the impairment charge decreased 141 as compared to the same period in 2003 operating expenses in 2004 include 34 million related to an impairment charge on our heldforsale f28 aircraft and spare engines to lower the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value explanations of other significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

 consolidated nonoperating income expense 

  net nonoperating income was 592 million in 2004 compared to 465 million in 2003 interest income increased 117 million due to a larger marketable securities portfolio in 2004 combined with a correction of 

28 premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities portfolio in 2003 2004 interest income also includes 33 million from the recovery in 2004 of disputed mexico navigation fees paid in 2002 and 2003 interest expense net of capitalized interest increased 47 million due to increases in debt balances as compared to 2003 

  othernet includes 286 million and 64 million in gains from settled fuel hedging contracts in 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition othernet includes marktomarket gains on unsettled hedge contracts of 569 million in 2004 

  the 2003 results include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon received in connection with the government reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act 

   our consolidated effective income tax benefit for 2004 was 257 compared to an effective income tax expense rate of 534 in 2003 due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses such as employee per diem costs relative to pretax profit or loss a relatively small change in pretax results can cause a significant change in the effective tax rate 

   our consolidated net income for 2003 was 135 million or 051 per share compared with a net loss of 1186 million or 447 per share in 2002 our 2003 results include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon received related to assistance from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act our 2002 net loss includes 05 million received from the government and 514 million related to the writeoff of goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas no 142 see discussion in note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements excluding the government compensation received in 2003 and 2002 and the goodwill writeoff in 2002 our net loss for 2003 was 308 million 115 per share compared to 675 million 254 per share for 2002 

  our consolidated operating loss for 2003 was 175 million compared to 932 million for 2002 our consolidated pretax income for 2003 was 290 million compared with a consolidated pretax loss before accounting change of 1018 million for 2002 financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 18 and 19 respectively on pages 20 through 22 we have included a reconciliation of reported nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 

   operating revenues increased 1943 million or 106 during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 reflecting stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter traffic as compared to 2002 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 capacity increased 75 and traffic increased 104 as compared to the same period in 2002 the capacity increases are primarily due to the addition of service to new cities boston denver newark washington dc orlando and miami and an increase in service in the pacific northwest mexico and canada markets partially offset by lower capacity in the bay area arizona and northern alaska during 2003 roughly 75 of our asm growth came from expansion in the transcontinental and denver markets traffic increases primarily reflect service to new cities and traffic increases in the pacific northwest mexico and nevada partially offset by decreases in traffic in the bay area northern alaska and arizona higher traffic resulted in a 1727 million or 104 increase in passenger revenues our passenger load factor increased 19 percentage points to 700 during 2003 as compared to 2002 

  our yield per passenger mile remained constant compared to 2002 due to a combination of longer average stage lengths fewer business travelers and continued pricing pressure by low cost carriers partially offset by an increase in revenue from expired mileage plan accounts 

29   freight and mail revenues increased 52 million or 72 due principally to higher freight and mail volumes attributable to a reduction of security restrictions othernet revenues increased 164 million or 176 due largely to cash received from the sale of miles in our frequent flyer program impacting other revenue currently as a portion is recognized immediately and redemption of miles on partner airlines 

   for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 total operating expenses increased 1361 million or 71 as compared to the same period in 2002 this increase is due largely to a 75 increase in asms combined with higher fuel maintenance wages and benefits costs and landing fees and other rentals operating expense per asm decreased 03 as compared to the same period in 2002 from 987 cents to 984 cents operating expense per asm excluding fuel decreased 21 as compared to the same period in 2002 from 852 cents to 834 cents explanations of significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

 30  

   operating revenues increased 442 million or 105 during 2003 as compared to 2002 due in part to an increase in incentive payments from alaska for feed traffic which eliminates in consolidation for the twelve months ending december 31 2003 capacity increased 58 and traffic was up 83 compared to the same period in 2002 passenger load factor increased 15 percentage points to 639 during 2003 as compared to 2002 passenger yield increased 36 and combined with the increase in traffic resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of 484 million or 123 the increase in revenue and passenger yield resulted from improved economic conditions stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter revenue passenger miles 

  othernet revenues decreased 42 million or 203 primarily due to manufacturer payments received in 2002 as compensation for delays in the delivery of crj 700 aircraft which did not recur in 2003 

   for the twelve months ending december 31 2003 operating expenses increased 232 million or 53 as compared to the same period in 2002 this increase is due largely to a 58 increase in asms combined with higher wages and benefits aircraft maintenance landing fees and other rental costs operating expenses per asm decreased 05 as compared to the same period in 2002 from 1787 cents to 1779 cents in 2003 and 2002 respectively operating expenses per asm excluding fuel decreased 12 as compared to the same period in 2002 from 1599 cents to 1580 cents in 2003 and 2002 respectively explanations of significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

 31  

   net nonoperating items were 86 million expense in 2002 compared to 465 million income in 2003 the 2003 results include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon received in connection with the government reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid under the act interest income decreased 84 million due principally to lower interest rates and an adjustment of premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities portfolio interest expense net of capitalized interest increased 19 million due primarily to increases in debt resulting from the completion of a private placement of 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes in the first quarter of 2003 see discussion at note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  othernet includes 81 million and 107 million in gains resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on fuel hedging contracts in 2003 and 2002 respectively in 2003 we received an insurance recovery of 31 million in connection with legal fees associated with a us attorney investigation in oakland in 2002 we received a 14 million insurance recovery and a 09 million gain on conversion of equant nv shares a telecommunications network company owned by many airlines 

   effective january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under this statement goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis during the second quarter of 2002 we completed the first step of our impairment test related to our 514 million of goodwill the test was performed using alaska and horizon as separate reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2002 we completed the second step of our impairment test and determined that all of our goodwill was impaired as a result we recorded a onetime noncash charge effective january 1 2002 of 514 million 125 million alaska and 389 million horizon to writeoff all of our goodwill this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for 2002 

   the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following critical accounting estimates we have discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 

   our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our credit card partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners as long as the mileage plan is in existence we have an obligation to provide this future travel therefore for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation 

32 is provided the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as othernet revenue for awards issued and flown on other airlines 

  at december 31 2004 we had approximately 86 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability of 4093 million the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption impacts the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 

  1 the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel 

   2 the number of miles used per award ie free ticket 

   3 the costs which will be incurred to carry the passenger 

   4 redemption on alaska or horizon versus other airlines 

   5 the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles 

   we review all mileage plan estimates each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

   we account for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 87 “employer’s accounting for pensions” under sfas no 87 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods pension expense calculated under sfas no 87 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 783 million 735 million and 400 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions at december 31 2004 the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled 6070 million we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately 58 million during 2005 

  pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases at december 31 2004 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 80 this rate is equal to the assumed rate of 80 used at december 31 2003 and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2004 is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 80 to 75 would increase our estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 31 million 

  pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 575 and 600 at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality longterm bonds decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 575 to 525 would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at december 31 2004 by approximately 520 million and increase estimated 2005 pension expense by approximately 87 million 

  the defined benefit plan for management personnel was closed to new entrants in 2003 we are working to restructure the defined benefits plans for other labor groups any such change could impact future pension expense and pension liabilities 

  future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 

   as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 19 billion of property and equipment and related assets in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset 

  in 2002 2003 and 2004 due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations except as related to the b737200c fleet and horizon’s idle fokker f28 aircraft and spare engines as described above see page 24 

  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test if cash flows do not materialize as estimated there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 

   the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance mechanisms to provide for workers’ compensation claims and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 

   during the third quarter of 2004 alaska announced a management reorganization and the closure of its oakland maintenance base contracting out of the related heavy maintenance contracting out of the company’s fleet service ground support equipment and facility maintenance functions and other initiatives total severance and related costs associated with this restructuring are estimated at 534 million our severance package offered to impacted employees included cash payments based on years of service and one year of medical coverage after severance date since alaska selfinsures for employee medical coverage we estimated the projected claims cost for affected employees and recorded a corresponding accrual actual experience will likely differ from the estimate if employees accept positions with other employers and no longer need the coverage provided by alaska or simply submit claims during the one year period that are higher or lower than our estimate we expect to adjust this accrual quarterly throughout 2005 

   the company has a net deferred tax liability of 989 million at december 31 2004 which includes gross deferred tax assets of 3961 million offset by a gross deferred tax liability of 4950 million in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes”  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized based on the available evidence we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december 31 2004 our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income should we incur additional losses in the future our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period 

   the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 

   during the year ended december 31 2004 our cash and marketable securities increased 616 million to 8739 million this increase reflects cash provided by operating activities of 3340 million offset by cash used in financing activities of 1069 million cash used for property and equipment additions of 1675 million and net purchases of marketable securities of 2045 million 

   during 2004 net cash provided by operating activities was 3340 million compared to 3552 million during 2003 operating cash inflows in 2003 included 714 million of government compensation whereas cash inflows in 2004 included 427 million of cash received from a tax refund 

   cash used in investing activities was 3657 million during 2004 compared to 6381 million in 2003 we had net purchases of 2045 million of marketable securities and 1675 million for property and equipment during 2004 our aircraft related capital expenditures decreased 1886 million as compared to 2003 reflecting a reduction in spending for new aircraft and capitalized overhauls beginning january 1 2005 we will have no capital expenditures related to overhauls as those maintenance activities will be expensed as incurred under our maintenance accounting policy that will be adopted on that date 

   net cash used in financing activities was 1069 million during 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 2068 million during 2003 debt issuances during 2004 of 946 million were secured by flight equipment these debt issuances have interest rates that vary with the london interbank offered rate libor and payment terms ranging from 12 to 16 years debt issuances during the period were offset by normal longterm debt payments of 599 million and full repayment of our credit facility of 150 million in 2003 we completed the private placement of 150 million of floating rate senior convertible notes 

  we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through cash flow from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand at december 31 2004 totaling 8739 million we also have restricted cash of 126 million which is intended to collateralize interest payments due in the next two years on our 150 million floating rate senior convertible notes due 2023 issued in 2003 

   during 2004 alaska paid off its 150 million credit facility and on december 23 2004 that facility expired management is currently negotiating a replacement facility and expects to close the new facility during the first quarter of 2005 although there can be no assurance that this can be accomplished on terms acceptable to us 

  the 150 million credit facility that expired in december 2004 contained contractual restrictions required maintenance of specific levels of net worth maintenance of certain debt and leases to net worth leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and limits on investments lease obligations sales of assets and additional indebtedness such provisions also limited the amount of funds alaska airlines can distribute via dividend to alaska air group the notes did not restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to enter into additional agreements limiting or prohibiting the distribution of earnings loans or other payments to alaska air group as noted above we are currently negotiating with a replacement facility and hope to have that agreement completed by the end of the first quarter we expect that the new line of credit facility will be at least as restrictive as the prior credit facility 

   in 2003 alaska air group completed the private placement of 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 pursuant to rule 144a of the securities act of 1933 as amended net proceeds from the offering were 1449 million of which 223 million was used to acquire us government securities to fund the first three years of interest payments in 2003 we made a capital contribution to alaska airlines of the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the notes alaska airlines has used the remaining proceeds from the notes for working capital requirements and expects in the future to continue to use these remaining proceeds for working capital requirements as well as other general corporate purposes although we have not yet determined how each payment of principal or interest due will be funded in the future we anticipate that 

36 these payments will be funded either by dividends distributions loans advances or other payments from our subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by alaska air group any such payments by our subsidiaries to air group could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 

  the holders of the 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 may elect to have the company redeem all or a portion of the notes on the 5th 10th and 15th anniversaries of the date of issuance on september 30 2004 we entered into the first supplemental indenture with respect to the notes to rescind the company’s right to pay for such a repurchase of the notes at the option of the holders in whole or in part in shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the notes as amended any such repurchases shall be paid for in cash 

   during 2004 horizon financed three bombardier q400s under longterm debt arrangements totaling 447 million these debt arrangements have a 15year term and interest rates that vary with libor two of the aircraft were originally leased in january 2004 and were treated as capital leases at that time the resulting refinancing transactions did not result in any gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 

contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

   at december 31 2004 we had firm orders for 12 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately 2911 million as set forth below in addition alaska had options to acquire 26 additional b737’s and horizon had options to acquire 15 q400’s and 25 crj 700’s alaska and horizon expect to finance the firm orders and to the extent exercised the option aircraft with leases longterm debt or internally generated cash one b737800 was delivered in february 2005 and two others are expected in march and july of 2005 we have secured lease financing for the march delivery we purchased the b737800 aircraft delivered in february 2005 with cash on hand at the time and expect to do the same for the july delivery we expect to finance the crj700 delivered in 2005 with debt financing 

  the following table summarizes aircraft purchase commitments and payments by year as of december 31 2004 

   in february 2005 we converted options to acquire three b737800 aircraft into firm orders to be delivered in 2006 this results in additional purchase commitments which have been excluded from the table above 

   the following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and longterm debt obligations operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of december 31 2004 this table excludes contributions to our various pension plans which we expect to be approximately 60 million to 75 million per year through 2008 

  

 

 

   in march 2004 the financial accounting standards board’s fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” eitf 031 the guidance prescribes a threestep model for determining whether an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments the accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2004 while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2004 in september 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf 0311 “effective date of paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” fsp eitf 03011 fsp eitf 0311 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 1020 of eitf issue 0301 during the period of the delay fsp eitf 0311 states that companies should continue to apply relevant “otherthantemporary” guidance the company will assess the impact of paragraphs 1020 of eitf 031 once the guidance has been finalized at december 31 2004 availableforsale investments in the company’s marketable securities portfolio had unrealized losses totaling 40 million which are recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income management does not believe that the securities with unrealized losses as of december 31 2004 meet the criteria for recognizing the loss under existing otherthantemporary guidance 

  during the fourth quarter of 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas 123r “share based payments an amendment of fasb no 123 and 95” the new standard requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based 

38 compensation issued to employees this new standard will apply to both stock options that we grant to employees and our employee stock purchase plan which features a lookback provision and allows employees to purchase stock at a discount in excess of 5 our options are typically granted with graded vesting provisions and we intend to amortize compensation cost over the service period using the straight line method this new statement is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 our third quarter of 2005 we intend to use the “modified prospective method” upon adoption whereby previously awarded but unvested equity awards are accounted for in accordance with sfas 123r but prospective amounts are recognized in the income statement instead of simply being disclosed our stock based compensation expense as measured under sfas 123 approximates 8 to 10 million per year on a pretax basis 

  during the third quarter of 2004 the emerging issues task force eitf affirmed its tentative conclusion reached in july of 2004 on eitf issue no 0408 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted eps” eitf 0408 eitf 0408 requires companies to include certain contingently convertible securities in the calculation of diluted eps to the extent the inclusion of the shares would not be antidilutive beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004 because the company’s convertible notes fall under the scope of eitf 0408  the company expects to report a lower diluted eps to the extent the convertible notes are not antidilutive retroactive application of eitf 0408 is required and our quarterly data in item 8 has been revised accordingly the notes were antidilutive for the fourth quarter and full year of 2004 

  the following example illustrates the application of this consensus on the third quarter of 2004 

   in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 as amended by fin 46 revised in december 2003 requires consolidation of certain types of entities in which the company absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity these entities are called “variable interest entities” the principal characteristics of variable interest entities are 1 an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity’s expected losses 2 equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity’s activities and 3 equity that does not absorb the entity’s losses or receive the entity’s residual returns variable interests are contractual ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity’s net asset value as a result variable interest entities can arise from items such as lease agreements loan arrangements guarantees or service contracts 

  if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity the entity must be consolidated by the “primary beneficiary” the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity’s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable interests entity 

39   fin 46 was applicable to financial statements of companies that have interests in “special purpose entities” as defined during the year ended 2003 

  we are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our leased aircraft in many instances the lessors are trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase finance and lease aircraft to us these leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities however they do not meet the consolidation requirements of fin 46 because we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity’s expected gains or losses our conclusions are based on the fact that the leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include residual value guarantees made by us fixedprice purchase obligations or similar features that obligate us to absorb the majority of expected losses of the variable interest entities our maximum exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the remaining lease payments which are reflected in future lease commitments in note 5 plus the cost if any of bringing the equipment into compliance with the physical condition required for return 

  effect of inflation  — inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income 

40 risk factors 

  our operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties such as global and industry instability intense competition volatile fuel prices a largely unionized labor force the need to finance large capital expenditures government regulation potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions if any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer in such case the trading price of our common stock could also decline 

   the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares flight frequency frequent flyer benefits routes and service the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats we currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company others are operating under bankruptcy court protection and run lower costs more quickly than we can some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 

  our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage significant portions of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2004 this traffic to and from seattle accounted for 63 of total traffic we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground operations as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in these regions as a result we remain highly dependent upon our key markets our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets such as adverse changes in local economic conditions negative public perception of a key market and significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our operating results 

  many airlines including ours have code share and frequent flyer marketing alliances with other airlines internet distribution arrangements either in conjunction with other airlines or with independent travel websites have become an important means for selling airline travel any consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry or our loss of key alliance or distribution relationships could result in our competitors having access to increased route networks and resources which in turn would increase the risks of competition described above 

  the airline industry particularly the regional airlines also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives such as the bus train or automobile video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lowercost substitutes for air travel 

   fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses comprising 19 of total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 significant increases in fuel costs during 2004 have negatively impacted our results of operations further increases would harm our financial condition and results of operations we estimate that during the year ended december 31 2004 and during the year ended december 31 2003 a onecent increase in the price per gallon of fuel would have increased our fuel expenses by 40 million and 39 million respectively average economic fuel prices which include the benefits of our hedging program during 2004 were 353 cents higher than in 2003 total fuel costs net of the benefit received from fuel hedges settled during the period were 1774 million higher in 2004 compared to 2003 

41   historically fuel costs have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty in the event of a fuel supply shortage higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result some of our competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel we may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher fares we utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices to hedge our exposure to fuel price fluctuations we began purchasing hedging instruments primarily instruments that cap the price paid at december 31 2004 we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge 50 of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2005 and 35 and 9 of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2006 and 2007 respectively even with hedges we are substantially exposed to increases in jet fuel costs 

   we along with other airlines have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities 

  we have implemented initiatives that we believe will reduce our annual operating costs by approximately 185 million and seek additional savings of approximately 155 million the majority of which is being sought from our labor groups and to a lesser extent additional cost reductions in ticket distribution maintenance and other costs we hope to achieve labor savings through a combination of marketbased wage adjustments a common health and retirement benefits package for every work group and work rule changes focusing on greater efficiency in operations we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement changes in our operations sufficient to generate this level of additional targeted savings or that if such changes are implemented that forecasted savings will be achieved in the event that we are unable to achieve our cost reduction goals or our efforts prove less successful than those of our competitors our results of operations will likely be below our own expectations and may be below those of outside financial analysts and our financial condition may be harmed 

   as of december 31 2004 labor unions represented 83 of alaska’s and 45 of horizon’s employees labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses comprising approximately 35 of our total operating expenses in 2004 each of our different employee groups has separate collective bargaining agreements and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability 

  at december 31 2004 we were in contract talks with most labor groups and had submitted to binding arbitration with the airline pilots association alpa the degree to which we meet our overall labor savings goals will be determined to a large extent by the results of the pilot arbitration 

  the pilot contract provides that if an agreement on the entire contract was not reached by december 15 2004 ten contract issues plus wage rates would be submitted to an interest arbitrator issues submitted generally relate to pension plans medical insurance profit sharing code sharing and work rules the parties did not reach an agreement and the issues have been submitted to binding arbitration in march 2005 with a decision to be effective in may 2005 the pilot labor contract contains market related standards for wages and nonwage issues 

  if we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction we could be subject to work 

42 slowdowns or stoppages we could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business in the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed 

   we believe that airline traffic including business traffic is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations weak economic growth in 2001 through the first half of 2003 low ticket yields and escalating fuel prices contributed to much of the airline industry suffering significant losses from 2001 through 2004 currently us airways united airlines and ata airlines as well as other carriers operate under bankruptcy protection because airlines operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations current and future airline bankruptcies could have a substantial impact on industry competition in the event airlines who have received bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they obtain toward reduced fares bankruptcy by airlines who compete with us may cause us to reduce our fares and result in a substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin continued weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional industry consolidation greater reliance on industry alliances such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity arrangements and increased price competition among existing carriers each of which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets we serve and harm our operating results continued weak economic performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in our credit rating and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on economical terms any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm our business 

   we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our computerized airline reservation system our telecommunication systems and our website we also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data increase our expenses and generally harm our business 

   airlines pay or are responsible for collecting a number of different taxes and fees including but not limited to fuel taxes airport facility charges immigration fees security fees excise taxes on ticket sales and fuel taxes recently the united states department of homeland security proposed raising the aviation security fee from 250 per oneway segment to 550 per oneway segment 

  we believe the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to fare levels although law makers may impose additional fees and view them as “pass through costs” we believe that a higher total ticket price in the eyes of the consumer will influence their purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business 

  moreover we believe that the impact of higher fees is proportionally greater for low fare carriers carriers with a high percentage of leisure travelers and carriers that fly relatively short segments because alaska 

43 carriers many leisure travels and horizon flies many short haul segments we believe higher security fees and other fee increases generally could negatively impact air group more than some of our competitors 

   the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry including our company because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the shortterm we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry including us and could 

 

   following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for thirdparty claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events to 50 million per event and in the aggregate in light of this development under the air transportation safety and stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 as amended by the consolidated appropriations act of 2005 the government is currently offering domestic airlines either i thirdparty liability war risk coverage above 50 million or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance full hull comprehensive and thirdparty liability war risk coverage this coverage provides for the same limits of hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of thirdparty liability insurance carried by the airline on september 11 2001 

  aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull comprehensive and thirdparty war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through august 31 2005 while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

   airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the dot and the faa have issued regulations relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time 

44 to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel if adopted these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices reducing revenue andor increasing costs 

   an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public in addition we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business 

   like other airlines our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control including air traffic congestion at airports adverse weather conditions and increased security measures delays frustrate passengers reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs all of which in turn affect our profitability during periods of fog snow rain freezing rain storms or other adverse weather conditions flights may be canceled or significantly delayed due to our geographic area of operations we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors cancellations or delays due to weather conditions traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

   alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements although our 150 million revolving credit facility expired in december 2004 we are currently negotiating a replacement facility we expect this facility to have covenants that are as restrictive if not more than those in our recently expired agreement we cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs alaska’s inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and could result in a cross default under alaska’s other financing agreements in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable air group or alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if such financing were not available alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession which could harm our business 

   our business is labor intensive with labor costs representing approximately 35 of our operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 we expect salaries wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase as a percentage of our overall costs which could harm our business we compete against the major us airlines for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be 

45 unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 

   we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling catering computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance as part of its cost control efforts the reliance on outside vendors will increase in september 2004 alaska airlines announced that it was subcontracting the remaining heavy aircraft maintenance that it was then performing to outside vendors in addition alaska retained outside suppliers for fleet service and facilities maintenance in january 2005 alaska signed an agreement with a vendor for ground handling services at seattle in the event that it does not reach an agreement with the iam representing its ramp employees 

  our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms these events could result in disruptions in alaska’s operations or increases in its cost structure 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 air group incurred an operating loss of 798 million prior to that we incurred operating losses of 175 million and 932 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the inability to achieve or sustain profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms and to sustain and expand our business 

  in addition our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and weather because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results due to these factors as well as other risk factors described in this form 10k quartertoquarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance in addition it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company in that event the price of air group’s common stock could decline perhaps substantially 

   we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 10430 million of indebtedness outstanding approximately 8925 million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property 

  our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 46 

 in addition we have an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries and there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 

   horizon operates regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a 12year agreement with frontier airlines that began in january 2004 currently that flying represents approximately 23 of horizon’s total capacity and 99 of horizon’s passenger revenue under the arrangement frontier airlines pays horizon the expected costs of providing the service plus a base markup if frontier were to have financial difficulties and find it necessary to terminate the agreement we would have significant excess capacity that we would have to deploy elsewhere there can be no assurance that this excess capacity could be deployed in profitable markets and our unit operating costs would likely increase 

   in 2003 air group’s credit ratings were downgraded by both sp and moody’s on march 14 2003 the senior implied rating for alaska air group was downgraded from ba3 to b1 by moody’s with a commensurate reduction in other ratings on september 4 2003 standard  poor’s announced that it lowered the corporate credit rating from bb to bb with a commensurate reduction in other ratings we cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline in the future if any of our ratings decline this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices if any of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   we have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio and commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy we have market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

   we purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage the risk of price fluctuations through execution of a documented hedging strategy we utilize derivative financial instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases at december 31 2004 we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge 2073 million gallons of our expected jet fuel usage during 2005 1488 million gallons in 2006 and 386 million gallons in 2007 this represents 50 35 and 9 of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2005 2006 and 2007 respectively prices of these agreements range from 2881 to 4265 per crude oil barrel we estimate that a 10 increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december 31 2004 would impact hedging positions by approximately 200 million 

  as of december 31 2004 and 2003 the fair values of our fuel hedge positions were 960 million and 184 million respectively of these amounts 657 million of the 2004 fair value amounts and 120 million of the 2003 fair value amounts were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets based on settlement dates for the underlying contracts the remaining 303 million 2004 fair value and 64 million 2003 fair value is reflected in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

  please refer to item 6 on pages 20 through 22 as well as to note 10 in the consolidated financial statements for company specific data on the results of our fuel hedging program 

   we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variable rates which have exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt during 2004 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 43 million 

  we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2004 interest income would increase by approximately 20 basis points

marketing and competition alliances with other airlines alaska and horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and code sharing on certain flights as set forth below alliances enhance alaska’s and horizon’s revenues by offering our customers more travel destinations and better mileage accrualredemption opportunities gaining us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and horizon while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs alaska’s and horizon’s marketing agreements have various termination dates and at any time one or more may be in the process of renegotiation if a significant agreement were terminated it could adversely impact revenues and increase the costs of our other marketing agreements most of our code share relationships are freesell code shares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory but takes no inventory risk the table below identifies our marketing alliances with other airlines as of december 31 2003  

 this airline does not have its own frequent flyer program however alaska’s mileage plan members can accrue and redeem miles on this airline’s route system  capacity purchase arrangement as described under “business – general information – horizon” competition competition in the airline industry is intense we believe the principal competitive factors in the industry are   4 

 any domestic air carrier issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the department of transportation is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the united states together alaska and horizon carry approximately 31 of all us domestic passenger traffic alaska and horizon compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes some of these competitors are substantially larger than alaska and horizon have greater financial resources and have more extensive route systems due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes with ground transportation including train bus and automobile transportation most major us carriers have developed independently or in partnership with others large global distribution systems airlines including alaska and horizon are charged fees to have their flight schedules included in the various computer reservation systems used by travel agencies and airlines these systems have historically been the predominant means of distributing airline tickets and have been subject to regulation by the department of transportation air carriers are increasingly distributing their services on the internet through various airline joint venture or independent websites we currently participate in a number of these distribution channels but we cannot predict the terms on which we may be able to continue to participate in these or other sites or their effect on our ability to compete with other airlines regulation general the airline deregulation act of 1978 as amended eliminated most domestic economic regulation of passenger and freight transportation however the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration faa still exercise regulatory authority over air carriers in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the us a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the department of transportation subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the us a certificate is of unlimited duration but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificate itself in addition the department of transportation maintains jurisdiction over the approval of international code share agreements alliance agreements between domestic major airlines international route authorities and certain consumer protection matters such as advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability the faa regulates aircraft operations generally including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa pursuant to these regulations we have established and the faa has approved a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the 5 

ongoing maintenance of such aircraft ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls in addition the faa has issued a number of directives that we are incorporating into our aircraft these relate to among other things enhanced ground proximity warning systems cockpit door security enhancements mcdonnell douglas md80 insulation blanket replacement md80 main landing gear piston improvements and boeing 737 rudder and elevator improvements based on our current implementation schedule we are or expect to be in compliance with the applicable requirements within the required time periods the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters the us postal service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board nmb certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and collective bargaining agreements to the extent we continue to pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies in november 2001 the aviation and transportation security act the security act was enacted the security act created a new government agency the transportation security administration tsa which is now part of the department of homeland security and is responsible for aviation security the security act mandates that the tsa shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property including us mail cargo carryon and checked baggage and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft the tsa performs these functions with its own federal employees on december 31 2002 the tsa began explosive detection screening of all checked baggage  the tsa also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft and requires federal air marshals to be present on certain flights effective february 1 2002 the security act imposed a 250 per enplanement security service fee maximum 500 oneway fee which is collected by the air carriers and submitted to the government to pay for these enhanced security measures additionally to the extent the tsa determines that such fee is insufficient to pay for the cost of providing the security measures as mentioned in the previous paragraph in each of the years 2002 2003 and 2004 air carriers may be required to submit to the government an amount equal to the amount the air carriers paid for screening passengers and property in 2000 after that this fee may be assessed based on the air carrier’s market share in 2002 the tsa began assessing payments under this feature of the security act we paid 99 million and 84 million to the tsa for this security charge in 2002 and 2003 respectively effective june 1 2003 congress suspended the security fee until september 30 2003 and authorized a partial refund of security fees that the airlines paid before that time in addition the security act requires air carriers to honor tickets on a standby basis from other air carriers that are insolvent or bankrupt and suspend service within 18 months of the passage of the security act this deadline was extended to april 30 2004 to be eligible a passenger must make arrangements with the air carrier within 60 days after the date on which the passenger’s air transportation was suspended to date this provision has not had a substantial impact on our airlines if a major us air carrier were to declare bankruptcy and cease or suspend operations this feature of the security act could have an impact on our airlines to the extent we are not fully 6 

reimbursed for the costs of honoring such tickets the impact could be materially adverse the department of transportation under its authority to prevent unfair competitive practices in the industry has considered the issuance of pricing and capacity rules that would limit major air carriers’ competitive response to new entrant carriers although the department of transportation as recently as 2001 declined to issue specific competitive guidelines it reiterated its intent to prevent what it considers to be unfair competitive practices in the industry and to pursue enforcement actions on a casebycase basis to the extent that future department of transportation enforcement actions either directly or indirectly impose restrictions upon our ability to respond to competitors our business may be adversely impacted conversely a relaxation in either unfair competition enforcement or restrictions could limit our ability to enter new markets or harm our operating results for markets that we have recently entered airline fares airlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation and the industry is characterized by vigorous price competition the department of transportation maintains authority over international generally outside of north america fares rates and charges international fares and rates are also subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries we serve while air carriers are required to file and adhere to international fare and rate tariffs substantial commissions overrides and discounts to travel agents brokers and wholesalers characterize many international markets legislation sometimes referred to as the “passengers’ bill of rights” has been discussed in congress and state legislatures this legislation could if enacted place various limitations on airline fares andor affect operating practices such as baggage handling and overbooking effective december 15 1999 we as well as other domestic airlines implemented a customer service plan to address a number of service goals including but not limited to goals relating to  in february 2001 the department of transportation inspector general issued a report on the various air carriers’ performance of their customer service plans the report included a number of recommendations which could limit our flexibility with respect to various operational practices in february 2001 a bill proposing an “airline customer service improvement act” was introduced in the us senate in addition other items of legislation have been introduced that 7 

would limit hub concentration reallocate slots at certain airports and impose higher landing fees at certain hours to the extent legislation is enacted that would inhibit our flexibility with respect to fares our revenue management system our operations or other aspects of our customer service operations our financial results could be adversely affected fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we are generally required to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic during recent years a number of new lowcost airlines have entered the domestic market and several major airlines including alaska and horizon implemented efforts to lower their cost structures further fare reductions domestic and international may occur in the future if fare reductions are not offset by increases in passenger traffic cost reductions or changes in the mix of traffic that improves yields our operating results will be negatively impacted in february 2004 alaska initiated a fare rationalization plan whereby a number of restrictions were eliminated and the gap between the highest and lowest fares was reduced the goal of this initiative is to increase customer value and simplify the customer’s purchase decision airport access heavily used airports may have restrictions with respect to the number of permitted takeoffs and landings the total permitted annual seat capacity to be operated at an airport the use or allocation of airport slots or other restrictions we currently have sufficient authorizations to operate our existing flights and have generally been able to obtain gates to expand our operations and change our schedules however we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain authorizations for these purposes in the future or be able to do so on economical terms environmental matters we are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the us and other countries us federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 the clean air act the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the safe drinking water act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or superfund act we are also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration known as osha concerning employee safety and health matters the us environmental protection agency or epa osha and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations in addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations some of which are similar to federal requirements we maintain our own continuing safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements the airport noise and capacity act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system authorities in several cities have promulgated aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews the airport noise and capacity act generally requires faa 8 

approval of local noise restrictions on aircraft while we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date our operations could be adversely affected if such regulations become more restrictive or widespread although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we cannot assure you that new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate will not harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods employees the airline business is labor intensive alaska and horizon had 10996 and 3742 respectively active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2003 wages salaries and benefits represented approximately 38 of our total operating expenses in 2003 at december 31 2003 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 43 of horizon’s employees our relations with such labor organizations are governed by the railway labor act under this act the collective bargaining agreements between air group and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner described in the agreement after receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the national mediation board to appoint a federal mediator if no agreement is reached in mediation the national mediation board may declare at some time that an impasse exists at which point the national mediation board proffers binding arbitration to the parties either party may decline to submit to arbitration if arbitration is rejected by either party a 30day “cooling off” period commences during that period a presidential emergency board may be established which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution the presidential emergency board process lasts for 30 days and is followed by a “cooling off” period of 30 days at the end of a “cooling off” period unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by congress the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “selfhelp” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of workers to replace strikers a number of alaska’s collective bargaining agreements contain provisions for interest arbitration under interest arbitration if the parties have not negotiated the contract by a predetermined date each side may submit a limited number of issues to binding arbitration the arbitrator’s decision on those open points then becomes part of the collective bargaining agreement and no strike or company selfhelp will occur the union contract with the alaska pilots among others contains an interest arbitration provision alaska is currently in negotiations with the association of flight attendants and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union representing its ramp service and stock clerks additionally alaska is in negotiations with the air line pilots association international outside of the normal contractual cycle a final decision on interest arbitration if it occurs would be made by april 30 2005 9 

alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2003 were as follows  

 collective bargaining agreement contains interest arbitration provision horizon’s union contracts at december 31 2003 were as follows  

fuel our operations are significantly affected by the availability and price of jet fuel fuel costs were 145 of our total operating expenses in 2003 and 131 in 2002 fuel prices which can be volatile and which are outside of our control can have a significant impact on our operating results currently a onecent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 39 million we believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft helps to mitigate the 10 

effect of high fuel prices we also purchase fuel hedge contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel due to the competitive nature of the airline industry in the event of continuing increases in the price of jet fuel there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on increased fuel prices to our customers by increasing our fares conversely any potential benefit of lower fuel prices may be offset by increased fare competition and lower revenues while we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas there could be reductions in the production andor importation of crude oil if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel our business would be adversely affected see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of our fuel hedging activities frequent flyer program all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner telephone companies hotels and car rental agencies alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacitycontrolled seating mileage plan accounts may be deleted after three years of inactivity in that member’s account as of december 31 2002 and 2003 alaska estimated that 2067000 and 2353000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20000mile free roundtrip domestic ticket award threshold of those eligible awards alaska estimated that 1931000 and 2073000 respectively would ultimately be redeemed for the years 2001 2002 and 2003 approximately 310000 441000 and 606000 roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 52 for 2001 68 for 2002 and 87 for 2003 of the total passenger miles flown for each period for the years 2001 2002 and 2003 approximately 154000 174000 and 174000 respectively roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a credit card company alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided on alaska or other airline the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on 11 

alaska and as other revenuenet for awards issued on other airlines at december 31 2002 and 2003 the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 3030 million and 3360 million respectively other information seasonality and other factors our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our business is somewhat seasonal our operating income is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters generally increases in the second quarter and reaches its highest level during the third quarter the airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high fixed costs primarily for personnel aircraft fuel debt service and rent the expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried and as a result a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include  in addition seasonal variations in traffic various expenditures and weather affect our operating results from quarter to quarter we tend to experience the highest levels of traffic and revenue during the third quarter of each year given our high proportion of fixed costs seasonality can affect our profitability from quarter to quarter many of our areas of operations experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions in addition fare initiatives fluctuations in fuel prices labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers consequently the loss of our largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 12 

insurance we carry insurance for passenger liability property damage and hull insurance for damage to our aircraft in amounts that in the opinion of management are adequate as a result of the events of september 11 2001 aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for thirdparty liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events at the same time they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 and the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of 2003 the government has offered and we have accepted war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august 31 2004 other government matters we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military callup the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft business risks our operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties such as global and industry instability intense competition volatile fuel prices a largely unionized labor force the need to finance large capital expenditures government regulation potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid environmental change we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the basis of competition in our markets changes the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares flight frequency frequent flyer benefits routes and service the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats we currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service reduce their fares or both in our markets we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets including seattle portland los angeles and anchorage significant portions of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub in 2003 this traffic to and from seattle accounted for 62 of 2003 traffic we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground operations as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in these 13 

regions as a result we remain highly dependent upon our key markets our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets such as adverse changes in local economic conditions negative public perception of a key market and significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our operating results many airlines including ours have marketing alliances with other airlines among other things they share the use of twoletter flight designator codes to identify their flights and fares in the computerized reservation systems and permit reciprocity in their frequent flyer programs internet distribution arrangements either in conjunction with other airlines or with independent travel websites are also becoming an important means for selling airline travel any consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry or our loss of key alliance or distribution relationships could result in our competitors having access to increased route networks and resources which in turn would increase the risks of competition described above the airline industry particularly the regional airlines also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives such as the bus train or automobile video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lowercost substitutes for air travel weakness in the general economy and in the airline industry in particular could have an adverse effect on our business we believe that airline traffic including business traffic is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations weak economic growth contributed to the airline industry suffering significant losses in 2001 2002 and the first half of 2003 during 2002 both us airways and united airlines filed for bankruptcy because airlines operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations current and future airline bankruptcies could have a substantial impact on industry competition in the event airlines who have received bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they obtain toward reduced fares bankruptcy by airlines who compete with us may cause us to reduce our fares and result in a substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin continued weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional industry consolidation greater reliance on industry alliances such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity arrangements and increased price competition among existing carriers each of which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets we serve and harm our operating results continued weak economic performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in our credit rating and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on economical terms any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm our business we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business we depend on automated systems to operate our business including our computerized airline 14 

reservation system our telecommunication systems and our website we also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets in order for our operations to work efficiently our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data increase our expenses and generally harm our business the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks negatively impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks or other hostilities involving the us may significantly harm our industry and our business in the future the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry including our company since a substantial portion of airline travel for both business and leisure is discretionary further terrorist activity connected with air travel or the threat of further terrorist activity could result in travelers canceling or deferring their plans for air travel and have a material adverse effect on our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2001 the temporary shutdown of domestic passenger air travel and reduced demand for air travel led alaska to reduce its flight schedule by approximately 13 and horizon to reduce its flight schedule by approximately 20 because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the short term however we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree additional terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry including us and could  if we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals our results of operations and financial condition may suffer we along with other airlines have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy the aim of these cost reduction initiatives is to improve our profitability without requiring a substantial increase in current fares and to better position us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities we believe that we have already implemented initiatives that will reduce our annual operating costs by approximately 80 million and plan on achieving approximately 230 million in additional 15 

savings through a combination of additional product and other costmanagement initiatives marketbased wage adjustments a common health and retirement benefits package for every work group and work rule changes focusing on greater efficiency in operations although we plan to work cooperatively with labor groups and employees to achieve these targets operating changes are not yet in place to generate this level of cost savings we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement changes in our operations sufficient to generate this level of savings or that if such changes are implemented that forecasted savings will be achieved in the event that we are unable to achieve our cost reduction goals or our efforts prove less successful than those of our competitors our results of operations will likely be below our own expectations and may be below those of outside financial analysts and our financial condition may be harmed many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a failure to negotiate new agreements or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our competitors could disrupt our business and increase our costs as of december 31 2003 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 43 of horizon’s employees alaska is currently in negotiations with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union which represents its ramp service and stock clerk work group labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses comprising 38 of our total operating expenses in 2003 each of our different employee groups may require separate collective bargaining agreements and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability if we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages we could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business in the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed increases in fuel costs would harm our business fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses comprising 145 of total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 significant increases in fuel costs would harm our financial condition and results of operations we estimate that during the year ended december 31 2003 a onecent increase in the price per gallon of fuel would have increased our fuel expenses by 39 million historically fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty in the event of a fuel supply shortage higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result some of our competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel we may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through 16 

higher fares we utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices to hedge our exposure to fuel price fluctuations we began purchasing hedging instruments primarily crude oil swaps during 2000 at december 31 2003 we had swap and cap agreements for crude oil contracts in place to hedge approximately 33 of our 2004 expected jet fuel requirements even with hedges we are substantially exposed to increases in jet fuel costs our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs would harm our business financial condition and results of operations following the september 11 terrorist attacks aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for thirdparty claims resulting from acts of terrorism war or similar events to 50 million per event and in the aggregate in light of this development under the air transportation safety and stabilization act the homeland security act of 2002 and the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of 2003 the government is currently offering domestic airlines either i thirdparty liability war risk coverage above 50 million or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance full hull comprehensive and thirdparty liability war risk coverage this coverage provides for the same limits of hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of thirdparty liability insurance carried by the airline on september 11 2001 aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of additional terrorist attacks hijackings airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry furthermore the full hull comprehensive and thirdparty war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through august 31 2004 with the possibility of an extension through december 31 2004 while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage we cannot be certain that any extension will occur or if it does how long the extension will last it is expected that should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs in the last several years congress has passed laws and the dot and the faa have issued regulations relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures for example on november 19 2001 the president signed into law the aviation and transportation security act the security act this law federalizes substantially all aspects of civil aviation security and requires among other things the implementation of certain security measures by airlines and airports such as the requirement that all passenger bags be screened for explosives funding for airline and airport security under the law is primarily provided by a new 250 per enplanement ticket tax with authority granted to the tsa to impose additional fees on the air carriers if necessary to cover 17 

additional federal aviation security costs implementation of the requirements of the security act will result in increased costs for our company and our passengers in addition to increased costs the security measures required to be implemented under the security act as well as additional security measures issued by the faa have on occasion resulted in a longer checkin process for passengers and caused delays and disruptions in airline service which has led to customer frustration and may reduce the demand for airline travel additional laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel if adopted these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices reducing revenue andor increasing costs our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft such as the loss of alaska flight 261 off the coast of california in january 2000 could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public in addition we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service airlines are required by the dot to carry liability insurance although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives which would harm our business our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including traffic congestion at airports weather conditions and increased security measures any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations like other airlines our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control including air traffic congestion at airports adverse weather conditions and increased security measures delays frustrate passengers reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs all of which in turn affect our profitability during periods of fog snow rain freezing rain storms or other adverse weather conditions flights may be canceled or significantly delayed due to our geographic area of operations we believe our operations are more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors cancellations or delays due to weather conditions traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations our failure to successfully expand our business could harm our financial condition and results of operations a part of our current profitability strategy involves increasing the frequency of flights in markets we currently serve expanding the number of markets served and increasing flight connection 18 

opportunities we believe that growth will allow us to achieve additional economies of scale and to manage unit costs increasing the number of markets we serve depends on our ability to access suitable airports facilities and in some cases regulatory approvals in targeted markets any condition that would deny limit or delay access to such airports facilities or approvals would constrain our ability to grow in addition successful growth depends on our ability to maintain yields and load factors at profitable levels inadequate revenues in new markets may require us to revise our current growth strategy we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully expand our existing markets or establish new markets and the failure to do so could harm our financial condition and results of operations if alaska fails to comply with financial covenants some of its financing agreements may be terminated alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements primarily its 150 million revolving credit facility we cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs alaska’s inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and would result in a cross default under alaska’s other financing agreements in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable air group or alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all if such financing were not available alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession which could harm our business our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs our business is labor intensive with labor costs representing 38 of our operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 we expect salaries wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase as a percentage of our overall costs which could harm our business we compete against the major us airlines for labor in many highly skilled positions if we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and therefore the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business we have incurred operating losses in each year since 2000 and may incur substantial operating losses in the future in addition our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially for the year ended december 31 2003 air group incurred an operating loss of 111 million prior to that we incurred operating losses of 889 million 1263 million and 331 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the inability to achieve or sustain 19 

profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms and to sustain and expand our business in addition our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic the timing of various expenditures and weather because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results accordingly a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results due to these factors as well as other risk factors described in this form 10k quartertoquarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance in addition it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company in that event the price of air group’s common stock could decline perhaps substantially our indebtedness could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 11136 million of indebtedness outstanding approximately 9551 million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property and approximately 85 million of capital lease obligations our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could  in addition we have an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries and there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms a downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt in 2003 air group’s credit ratings were downgraded by both sp and moody’s on march 14 2003 the senior implied rating for alaska air group was downgraded from ba3 to b1 by moody’s with a commensurate reduction in other ratings on september 4 2003 standard  poor’s announced that it lowered the corporate credit rating from bb to bb with a commensurate reduction in other ratings we cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline 20 

in the future if any of our ratings decline this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices if any of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain 21

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k all statements in the following discussion which are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors some of which we cannot predict or control for a discussion of these factors see item 1 “businessbusiness risks” general alaska and horizon operate as airlines however their business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially alaska is a major airline serving primarily alaska the us west coast five cities on the us east coast vancouver canada and mexico it operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is 967 miles horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest northern california and western canada it operates both jet and turboprop aircraft and its average passenger trip is 332 miles as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements beginning in 2004 horizon will operate regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under an agreement with frontier airlines year in review and current events overall economic conditions in 2003 improved slightly over 2001 and 2002 resulting in stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter revenue passenger miles rpms or traffic however industry demand levels as measured by passenger traffic remained below pre 2001 levels in an attempt to mitigate negative impacts on our business resulting from the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002 and the first half of 2003 our business strategy focuses on extensive cost reductions and revenue enhancement initiatives involving the review of every aspect of our operations we experienced increases in both traffic and available seat miles asms or capacity however our yields passenger fare divided by distance traveled remained flat at alaska year over year our unit costs excluding fuel declined at both alaska and horizon although fuel prices increased roughly 14 year over year we expect capacity to increase 6 for alaska and 19 for horizon in 2004 compared to 2003 in february 2004 alaska initiated a fare rationalization plan whereby a number of restrictions were eliminated and the gap between the highest and lowest fares was reduced the goal of this initiative is to increase customer value and simplify the customer’s purchase decision in june 2003 alaska met with leaders of its labor unions to begin a dialog over how alaska and its labor groups can work cooperatively to better position the airline for growth and success these meetings focused on our desire to achieve a cost structure that enables us to offer customers the services they want at fares they are willing to pay to earn a reasonable profit to grow our business and take advantage of opportunities and to secure the futures of as many of our employees as possible to reach these goals our objective is to reduce our cost per available seat 32 mile excluding fuel to 725 cents by 2005 however this is a goal and should not be viewed as a prediction of future performance as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in april 2003 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act was signed into legislation the act includes 23 billion of onetime cash payments to air carriers allocated based on each carrier’s share of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid to the transportation security administration since its inception in february 2002 additionally passenger security fees were not imposed by the tsa and carrier fees were not paid during the period june 1 2003 through september 30 2003 in may 2003 we received our share of the onetime cash grant in the amount of 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon in the fourth quarter of 2003 we made a decision to retire three 737200c aircraft when they become due for their scheduled maintenance heavy checks in 2004 as a result of this decision we revised our estimates of the useful lives on these aircraft which resulted in increased depreciation and amortization of approximately 16 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 we expect to record an additional 93 million in 2004 results of operations 2003 compared with 2002 our consolidated net income for 2003 was 135 million or 051 per share compared with a net loss of 1186 million or 447 per share in 2002 our 2003 results include 714 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon received related to assistance from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act our 2002 net loss includes 05 million received from the government and 514 million related to the writeoff of goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas no 142 see discussion in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements excluding the government compensation received in 2003 and 2002 and the goodwill writeoff in 2002 our net loss for 2003 was 308 million 115 per share compared to 675 million 254 per share for 2002 our consolidated operating loss for 2003 was 111 million compared to 889 million for 2002 our consolidated pretax income for 2003 was 290 million compared with a consolidated pretax loss before accounting change of 1018 million for 2002 financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages 29 and 30 respectively on page 31 we have included a reconciliation of reported nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures alaska airlines revenues operating revenues increased 1943 million or 106 during 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 capacity increased 75 and traffic increased 104 as compared to the same period in 2002 the capacity increases are primarily due to the addition of service to new cities boston denver newark washington dc orlando and miami and an increase in service in the pacific northwest mexico and canada markets partially offset by lower capacity in the bay area arizona and northern alaska during 2003 roughly 75 of our asm growth came from expansion in the transcontinental and denver 33 markets traffic increases primarily reflect service to new cities and traffic increases in the pacific northwest mexico and nevada partially offset by decreases in traffic in the bay area northern alaska and arizona higher traffic resulted in a 1727 million or 104 increase in passenger revenues our passenger load factor rpms divided by asms increased 19 percentage points to 700 during 2003 as compared to 2002 our yield per passenger mile remained constant compared to 2002 due to a combination of longer average stage lengths fewer business travelers and continued pricing pressure by low cost carriers partially offset by an increase in revenue from expired mileage plan accounts freight and mail revenues increased 52 million or 72 due principally to higher freight and mail volumes attributable to a reduction of security restrictions othernet revenues increased 164 million or 176 due largely to cash received from the sale of miles in our frequent flyer program impacting other revenue currently as a portion is recognized immediately and redemption of miles on partner airlines alaska airlines expenses for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 total operating expenses increased 1341 million or 70 as compared to the same period in 2002 this increase is due largely to a 75 increase in asms combined with higher fuel maintenance wages and benefits costs and landing fees and other rentals operating expense per asm excluding fuel decreased 21 as compared to the same period in 2002 from 852 cents to 834 cents explanations of significant periodoverperiod changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows    34      horizon air revenues operating revenues increased 442 million or 105 during 2003 as compared to 2002 due in part to an increase in incentive payments from alaska for feed traffic which eliminates in consolidation for the twelve months ending december 31 2003 capacity increased 58 and traffic was up 83 compared to the same period in 2002 passenger load factor increased 15 percentage points to 639 during 2003 as compared to 2002 passenger yield increased 36 and 35 combined with the increase in traffic resulted in an increase in passenger revenue of 484 million or 123 othernet revenues decreased 42 million or 203 primarily due to manufacturer payments received in 2002 as compensation for delays in the delivery of crj 700 aircraft which did not recur in 2003 horizon air expenses for the twelve months ending december 31 2003 operating expenses increased 231 million or 53 as compared to the same period in 2002 this increase is due largely to a 58 increase in asms combined with higher wages and benefits aircraft maintenance landing fees and other rental costs operating expenses per asm excluding fuel decreased 12 as compared to the same period in 2002 from 1599 cents to 1580 cents in 2003 and 2002

reimbursement of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid under the act interest income decreased 84 million due principally to lower interest rates and an adjustment of premium and discount amortization on our marketable securities portfolio interest expense net of capitalized interest increased 19 million due primarily to increases in debt resulting from the completion of a private placement of 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes in the first quarter of 2003 see discussion at note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements othernet includes 64 million in gains and 17 million in losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness on fuel hedging contracts in 2002 and 2003 respectively in 2003 we received an insurance recovery of 31 million in connection with legal fees associated with the us attorney investigation in oakland in 2002 we received a 14 million insurance recovery and a 09 million gain on conversion of equant nv shares a telecommunications network company owned by many airlines 2002 compared with 2001 the consolidated loss before accounting change for 2002 was 672 million or 253 per share compared with a loss of 434

writeoff of all of our goodwill see note 15 to consolidated financial statements financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon are shown in item 6 a discussion of this data follows alaska airlines revenues operating revenue increased 37 during 2002 as compared to 2001 available seat miles increased during each quarter of 2002 as compared to 2001 due to the addition of service to five cities calgary boston denver newark and miami and due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks on 4th quarter 2001 capacity for the full year 2002 capacity was up 80 while revenue passenger miles increased at a slightly lower rate 76 resulting in a 03 point decrease in passenger load factor in our largest market southern california capacity was slightly higher 37 in 2002 compared to 2001 and traffic was slightly lower resulting in a decrease in load factor of 11 points capacity and traffic gains experienced in the last two quarters in this market were offset by decreases in the first two quarters in our second largest market anchoragefairbanks to the us mainland both capacity and traffic increased when compared to 2001 traffic increased at a higher rate than capacity resulting in an increase in load factor of 18 points for the year the average load factor for our newest five cities was better than the system average yield per passenger mile was down in each quarter of the year 50 in the first quarter 25 in the second quarter 39 in the third quarter and 30 in the fourth quarter the decrease in passenger yield was due to a combination of fewer business passengers a drop off in demand due to the events of september 11 fare sales offered to stimulate demand and the sagging economy for the full year 2002 yields were down 36 the higher traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a 37 increase in passenger revenue freight and mail revenues decreased 78 after september 11 new security measures had a negative impact on our freight and mail volumes resulting in a negative impact on revenues othernet revenues increased 207 largely due to increased revenue from the sale of miles in alaska’s frequent flyer program and redemption of miles on partner airlines alaska recognizes revenue for the difference between the funds received for the sale of miles to third parties and the cost of the award redemptions on partner airlines alaska airlines expenses excluding fuel operating expenses grew by 855 million or 55 as a result of an 80 increase in asms and a 24 decrease in cost per asm the cost per asm excluding fuel increased by 02 during the first nine months of 2002 when compared to the same period in 2001 but decreased by 89 in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks in 2001 explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows  38  horizon air revenues for the year 2002 capacity was up 130 and traffic was up 121 resulting in a 04 point decrease in passenger load factor passenger yields were down 104 in the first quarter down 116 in the second quarter down 70 in the third quarter and down 37 in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in business passengers and the economic downturn for the full year 2002 yields were down 86 the increased traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a 25 increase in passenger revenue freight and mail revenues decreased 383 in june 2001 horizon ceased carrying general freight in order to focus on carrying higheryield small packages this change along with the impact of the september 11 terrorist attacks led to the decline in revenues othernet revenues increased 20 primarily due to manufacturer support received as compensation for delays in delivery of crj 700 aircraft 39 horizon air expenses cost per asm decreased 144 as a result of a 130 increase in asms combined with a 131 million or 33 decrease in operating expenses excluding fuel and special charge unit costs in 2001 were adversely impacted by the capacity reductions that resulted from the september 11 terrorist attacks additionally horizon’s expenses in 2001 were adversely impacted by the delay in the delivery of crj 700 aircraft from january 2001 to july 2001 explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows  40 consolidated nonoperating income expense net nonoperating loss was 129 million in 2002 compared to nonoperating income of 628 million in 2001 the 757 million decrease was primarily due to us government compensation of 814 million recognized in 2001 compared to 05 million in 2002 in 2001 alaska and horizon recognized 716 million and 98 million respectively of us government compensation during the third quarter of 2002 the dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of 02 million and 02 million respectively interest expense net of capitalized interest totaled 368 million in 2001 which compares to 436 million in 2002 cumulative effect of accounting change effective january 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under this statement goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis during the second quarter of 2002 we completed the first step of our impairment test related to our 514 million of goodwill the test was performed using alaska and horizon as separate reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2002 we completed the second step of our impairment test and determined that all of our goodwill was impaired as a result we recorded a onetime noncash charge effective january 1 2002 of 514 million 125 million alaska and 389 million horizon to writeoff all of our goodwill this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for 2002 critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations see note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have identified the following critical accounting estimates we have discussed the development selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee mileage plan we have a loyalty program that awards miles to passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners additionally we sell miles to third parties such as our credit card partner for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners we have an obligation to provide this future travel therefore for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska horizon or our travel partners we recognize a liability and the corresponding expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued on alaska and as othernet revenue for awards issued on other airlines 41 at december 31 2003 we had approximately 75 billion miles outstanding resulting in an aggregate liability of 336 million the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption impacts the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below  we review all mileage plan estimates each quarter and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 42 pension plans we account for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 87 “employer’s accounting for pensions” under sfas no 87 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods pension expense calculated under sfas no 87 is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of 200 million 400 million and 735 million in 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions at december 31 2003 the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled 5295 million we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately 490 million during 2004 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases at december 31 2003 we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a longterm rate of return of 80 this rate is equal to the assumed rate of 80 used at december 31 2002 and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as longterm inflation assumptions we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate this expected longterm rate of return on plan assets at december 31 2003 is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities decreasing the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 80 to 75 would increase our estimated 2004 pension expense by approximately 27 million pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of 675 and 600 at december 31 2002 and 2003 respectively the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality longterm bonds decreasing the discount rate by 05 from 600 to 550 would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at december 31 2003 by approximately 510 million and increase estimated 2004 pension expense by approximately 98 million future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future longlived assets as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 19 billion of property and equipment and related assets in accounting for these longlived assets we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate factors indicating potential impairment include but are not limited to significant decreases in the market value of the longlived assets a significant change in the longlived assets condition and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the longlived asset due to the events of september 11 and the impact on the airline industry in 2001 we evaluated whether the book 43 value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” we performed an impairment test as required by sfas no 121 which was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by our aircraft based on this test we determined that the horizon fokker f28 fleet was impaired and a writedown of 102 million was taken against the book value of those aircraft and related spare parts in 2002 and 2003 due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” this statement supercedes sfas no 121 no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test if cash flows do not materialize as estimated there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future liquidity and capital resources the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity  we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through cash and marketable securities on hand at december 31 2003 totaling 8123 million and internally generated funds from operations we also have restricted cash of 184 million which is intended to collateralize interest payments made on our 1500 million floating rate senior convertible notes due 2023 issued in 2003 during the year ended 2003 our cash and marketable securities increased 1765 million to 8123 million at december 31 2003 this increase primarily reflects cash provided by operating activities of 3552 million and cash provided by financing activities of 2068 million partially offset by cash used for the purchase of property and equipment of 3507 million and 335 million paid for restricted deposits and other cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 3552 million in 2003 compared to 1245 million in 2002 and 2865 million in 2001 significant cash flows in 2003 included the receipt of 714 44 million 528 million for alaska and 186 million for horizon from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act in may 2003 and our payment of 40 million to fund our defined benefit plans the increase in cash flows from 2002 to 2003 also resulted from a reduction in our net loss from 2002 other contributing factors to our operating cash flow include year over year increases in air traffic liabilities and other current liabilities cash flows from operations in 2001 include the receipt of 799 million in us government cash compensation received under the air transportation and safety and system stabilization act cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was 6381 million in 2003 compared to 3614 million in 2002 and 2182 million in 2001 in 2003 we had net purchases of 2539 million of marketable securities and 3507 million for property and equipment our aircraft related capital expenditures increased 1776 million over 2002 primarily reflecting additional aircraft added to alaska’s and horizon’s operating fleet including six 737700s five 737900s and two bombardier crj 700s cash provided by financing activities in 2003 we completed the private placement of 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 pursuant to rule 144a of the securities act of 1933 as amended net proceeds from the offering were 1449 million of which 184 is restricted to fund three years worth of interest payments proceeds from the notes were used to provide working capital for our operations in 2001 alaska borrowed 150 million payable on or before december 31 2004 under its credit facility the majority of which was added to cash and shortterm investments to provide future operating capital additionally debt issuances of 1295 million 580 million and 2345 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively were secured by the related flight equipment including the purchase of four one and eight new boeing aircraft in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively and one used boeing 737 aircraft in 2001 the 2003 debt issuances have interest rates that vary with the london interbank offered rate libor and payment terms ranging from 12 to 15 years during 2002 horizon added three dash 8400 and seven crj 700 aircraft to its operating fleet the aircraft were financed with a combination of us leveraged leases and single investor leases with terms of approximately 16 years contractual obligations commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2003 we had firm orders for 15 aircraft requiring aggregate payments of approximately 361 million as set forth below in addition alaska has options to acquire 26 additional b737s and horizon has options to acquire 15 q400s and 25 crj 700s alaska and horizon expect to finance the new aircraft with leases longterm debt or internally generated cash during the second quarter of 2003 alaska deferred the delivery of two boeing 737900’s from 2004 to 2005 during november 2003 horizon reached an agreement with bombardier to reschedule the delivery of four crj700’s in 2004 and six crj700’s in 2005 to two crj700 deliveries per year beginning in 2005 in addition horizon converted two 2004 firm orders for crj700’s to q400’s the following table summarizes aircraft deliveries and payments by year 45 delivery period  firm orders  alaska is party to a purchase agreement with an aircraft manufacturer under the agreement upon commitment to purchase the aircraft alaska must make deposits to the manufacturer for a portion of the purchase price of the aircraft with the remainder of the purchase price due at delivery concurrent with this agreement the manufacturer has an agreement with a trust wherein the trust makes additional periodic predelivery deposits to the manufacturer for the aircraft under certain specified events including default by the trust alaska may be required to pay the manufacturer the amounts to be paid by the trust in order to retain the right to purchase the aircraft alaska makes monthly payments to the trust related to the advances made by the trust to the manufacturer which payments are capitalized as part of the aircraft cost the trust is reimbursed for its advances on or before the delivery of the applicable aircraft as of december 31 2003 alaska’s obligations relating to such advances equaled approximately 116 million which will be paid in 2004 this amount is included as an aircraft purchase commitment in the summary of contractual obligations below the following table provides a summary of our current and longterm debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease commitments and aircraft purchase commitments as of december 31 2003 this table excludes other obligations that we may have such as pension obligations discussed in note 7 to consolidated financial statements and routine purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business  as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the 2004 capital lease obligation recorded on our balance sheet primarily represents the end of lease buyouts of two airplanes totaling 62 million in january 2004 subsequent to year end these leases were renegotiated and will be reflected as operating leases in future periods the table above excludes the capital lease obligation recorded at december 31 2003 related to the two aircraft 46 our 150 million credit facility expires and is due in december 2004 management is considering various alternatives including renewing or replacing the credit facility although there can be no assurance that this can be accomplished on acceptable terms to the company management also intends to make funding payments to our defined benefit plans during 2004 totaling 49 million our credit facility and certain loan agreements contain provisions that require maintenance of specific levels of net worth leverage and fixed charge coverage and limit investments lease obligations sales of assets and additional indebtedness at december 31 2003 we were in compliance with all loan provisions new accounting standards in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 46 fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 as amended by fin 46 revised in december 2003 requires consolidation of certain types of entities in which the company absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity these entities are called “variable interest entities” the principal characteristics of variable interest entities are 1 an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity’s expected losses 2 equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity’s activities and 3 equity that does not absorb the entity’s losses or receive the entity’s residual returns variable interests are contractual ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity’s net asset value as a result variable interest entities can arise from items such as lease agreements loan arrangements guarantees or service contracts if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity the entity must be consolidated by the “primary beneficiary” the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity’s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable interests entity fin 46 is applicable to financial statements of companies that have interests in “special purpose entities” as defined during the year ended 2003 we are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our leased aircraft in many instances the lessors are trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase finance and lease aircraft to us these leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities however they do not meet the consolidation requirements of fin 46 because we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity’s expected gains or losses our conclusions are based on the fact that the leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include residual value guarantees made by us fixedprice purchase obligations or similar features that obligate us to absorb the majority of expected losses of the 47 variable interest entities our maximum exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the remaining lease payments which are reflected in future lease commitments in note 5 plus the cost if any of bringing the equipment into compliance with the physical condition required for return in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensationtransition and disclosure” sfas no 148 amends the transition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 sfas no 148 allowed companies adopting the fair value based method of sfas no 123 to utilize one of three alternative transition methods as long as sfas no 123 was adopted in a fiscal year beginning prior to december 16 2003 to date the company has not adopted sfas no 123 and would therefore be required to use on of two methods proscribed by sfas no 148 if it adopted sfas no 123 in the future the fasb currently is working on a project to develop a new standard for accounting for stockbased compensation and expects to issue a final standard in the second half of 2004 in september 2003 the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants released a draft statement of position entitled “accounting for certain costs and activities related to property plant and equipment” draft sop the draft sop which is expected to be issued in its final form in first quarter 2004 would become effective for the company january 1 2005 the primary areas of applicability of the draft sop to the company are in the areas of planned major maintenance activities airframe and engine overhauls and component accounting as discussed in “property equipment and depreciation” the company currently capitalizes costs related to major airframe and engine overhauls and amortizes those costs to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term in the draft sop these costs would be considered a planned major maintenance activities and as such would be expensed as incurred effect of inflation  inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues operating expenses and operating income 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio and commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet we purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy we have market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes fuel hedging we utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices we believe there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases at december 31 2003 we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge 1321 million gallons of our expected jet fuel usage in 2004 1161 million gallons in 2005 and 102 million gallons in 2006 this 48 represents 33 28 and 2 of our anticipated fuel consumption in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively prices of these agreements range from 26 to 28 per barrel a hypothetical 10 increase in jet fuel prices would increase 2004 fuel expense by approximately 333 million a hypothetical 10 decrease in jet fuel prices would decrease 2004 fuel expense by approximately 340 million this analysis includes the effect of the fuel hedging contracts in place at december 31 2003 currently a onecent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 39 million we utilize financial derivative instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to jet fuel price changes we account for our fuel hedge derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended all changes in fair value that are considered to be effective hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the underlying jet fuel is consumed as of december 31 2002 and 2003 the fair values of our fuel hedge positions were 174 million and 184 million respectively all of the 2002 fair value amounts and 120 million of the 2003 fair value amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets the remaining 2003 fair value amount of 64 million is reflected in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets during 2002 and 2003 we recognized 121 million and 294 million respectively in realized hedging gains these amounts are reflected in aircraft fuel in our consolidated statements of operations hedge ineffectiveness resulted in nonoperating expense of 74 million for 2001 nonoperating income of 64 million for 2002 and nonoperating income of 17 million for 2003 these amounts are recorded as nonoperating income expense in othernet in our consolidated statements of operations in 2002 and 2003 we recorded a net gain of 101 million and a net loss of 12 million net of tax in other comprehensive income loss these amounts include the change in effectiveness as related to the change in fair market value for future derivative hedge instruments and the removal of the effective portion of derivative hedge instruments that matured during 2002 and 2003 financial market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and shortterm investment portfolio our debt obligations include variable rates which have exposure to changes in interest rates a hypothetical 10 change in the average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt during 2003 would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately 36 million during 2003 we issued 1295 million 650 million in the second quarter of 2003 320 million in the third quarter of 2003 and 325 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 of debt secured by flight equipment having interest rates that vary with libor and payment terms ranging from 12 to 15 years 49 on march 21 2003 we completed the private placement of 1500 million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in 2023 net proceeds from the offering were 1449 million of which 184 million is restricted to fund interest payments for the first three years and is reported as restricted cash 72 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 112 million in other assets in the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2003 see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this offering transaction we also have investments in marketable securities which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates if shortterm interest rates were to average 1 more than they did in 2003 interest income would increase by 50 basis points 50 


 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none 


 item 9a controls and procedures as of december 31 2003 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer collectively our “certifying officers” of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures these disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec’s rules and forms and that the information is communicated to our certifying officers on a timely basis our certifying officers concluded based on their evaluation that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as discussed in our form 8k filed with the commission on february 27 2004subsequent to our january 28 2004 press release summarizing our fourth quarter and full year 2003 financial results further review of the mileage plan liability and related deferred revenue as of december 31 2003 51 

revealed that these amounts had not been fully adjusted to reflect planned deletions of certain accounts with expired miles the consequent adjustment to reduce the total mileage plan liability and deferred revenue estimate from 3444 million to 3360 million resulted in an 84 million pretax increase in total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year which is reflected in the consolidated financial statements included herein this resulted from a deficiency in the application of computer system change control procedures which did not identify a mileage plan coding error nor was the error discovered in the normal account review process management believes that controls are now in place to ensure that expired miles are deleted appropriately we made no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2003 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially effect our internal control over financial reporting we intend to regularly review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and to improve these controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future while we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are effective future events affecting our business may cause us to modify our these controls and procedures in the future

alaska and horizon integrate their flight schedules to provide the best possible service between any two points served by their systems in 2001 28 of horizon’s passengers connected to alaska both airlines distinguish themselves from competitors by providing a higher level of customer service the airlines’ excellent service in the form of advance seat assignments expedited checkin attention to customer needs highquality food and beverage service wellmaintained aircraft a firstclass section aboard alaska aircraft and other amenities is regularly recognized by independent studies and surveys of air travelers 2 alliances with other airlines alaska and horizon have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and codesharing on certain flights as set forth below alliances enhance alaska’s and horizon’s revenues by a providing our customers more value by offering them more travel destinations and better mileage accrualredemption opportunities b gaining us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and c providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on alaska and horizon while earning mileage credit in the alliance partners’ programs 

  recent developments on september 11 2001 the united states was attacked by terrorists using four hijacked jets of two us airlines the federal aviation administration faa shut down all commercial airline flight operations for september 11 and 12 the company resumed flight operations at reduced levels on september 13 these events combined with slowing economic conditions had a significant negative impact on demand for airline travel throughout the industry airlines cut capacity and instituted a variety of costsaving measures 

the attacks had a significant impact on the operating results of the company in the 4 th quarter of 2001 alaska reduced its flight schedule by approximately 13 and horizon reduced its schedule by approximately 20 however the company was not able to proportionally reduce operating costs due to the fixed costs the company continued to incur such as aircraft rent and contract guaranteed wages also as a result of the terrorist attacks credit rating agencies downgraded the longterm credit ratings of most us airlines and their related entities including alaska air group inc on september 22 2001 the us government passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act to provide 5 billion of cash compensation and 10 billion of loan 3 guarantees to us airlines the purpose of the act was to compensate the airlines for direct and incremental losses for the period september 11 through december 31 2001 as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks as of december 31 2001 alaska had received 716 million and horizon had received 83 million of the 5 billion cash compensation during the third quarter of 2002 the united states department of transportation dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of 03 million and 02 million respectively security on november 19 2001 the us government enacted the aviation and transportation security act the security act the security act provides for the establishment of the transportation security administration the tsa within the dot which will be responsible for aviation security the tsa is to assume security functions for the faa and passenger screening functions currently performed or contracted by the airlines by february 17 2002 by november 19 2002 the tsa will be responsible for all passenger baggage and cargo screening functions and security utilizing federal employees also under the security act effective in february 2002 a 250 per enplanement security fee maximum 500 per oneway trip was imposed on passengers the tsa may also impose a fee upon air carriers to pay the difference between security costs and the amount collected from the fee limited to what the carrier paid in 2000 for security 

business risks the company’s operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties such as intense competition volatile fuel prices a largely unionized labor force the need to finance large capital expenditures government regulation potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions this report may contain forwardlooking statements that are based on the best information currently available to management the forwardlooking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 these forwardlooking statements are indicated by phrases such as “the company believes” “we anticipate” or any other language indicating a prediction of future events whether these statements are ultimately accurate depends on a number of outside factors that the company cannot predict or control the company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement the following discussion of business risks sets forth the principal foreseeable risks and uncertainties that may materially affect these predictions 

competition competition in the air transportation industry is intense any domestic air carrier deemed fit by the dot is allowed to operate scheduled passenger service in the united states together alaska and horizon carry approximately 25 of all us domestic passenger traffic alaska and horizon compete with one or more domestic or foreign airlines on most of their routes some of these competitors are substantially larger than alaska and horizon have greater financial resources and have more extensive route systems due to its shorthaul markets horizon also competes with the automobile 

4 most major us carriers have developed independently or in partnership with others large computerized reservation systems crs airlines including alaska and horizon are charged industryset fees to have their flight schedules included in the various crs displays used by travel agents and airlines these systems are currently the predominant means of distributing airline tickets in order to reduce anticompetitive practices the dot regulates the display of all airline schedules and fares air carriers are increasingly distributing their services on the internet through various airline joint venture or independent websites the company currently participates in a number of these distribution channels but it cannot predict the terms on which it may be able to continue to participate in these or other sites or their effect on the company’s ability to compete with other airlines fuel fuel costs were 142 of the company’s total operating expenses in 2001 fuel prices which can be volatile and are largely outside of the company’s control can have a significant impact on the company’s operating results currently a onecent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately 37 million the company believes that operating fuelefficient aircraft is an effective hedge against high fuel prices the company also purchases fuel hedge contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of the company’s fuel hedging activities 

unionized labor force labor costs were 35 of the company’s total operating expenses in 2001 wage rates can have a significant impact on the company’s operating results at december 31 2001 labor unions represented 84 of alaska’s and 46 of horizon’s employees the air transportation industry is regulated under the railway labor act which vests in the national mediation board certain regulatory powers with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions the company cannot predict the outcome of union contract negotiations or whether the terms of its labor contracts will hinder its ability to compete effectively nor can the company control the variety of actions eg work stoppage or slowdown unions might take to try to influence those negotiations 

leverage and future capital requirements the company like many airlines is relatively highly leveraged which increases the volatility of its earnings due to its high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings in addition the company has an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries and there is no assurance that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of liquidity and capital resources 

government regulation international routes like other airlines the company is subject to regulation by the faa and the dot the faa under its mandate to ensure aviation safety can ground aircraft suspend or revoke the authority of an air carrier or its licensed personnel for failure to comply with federal aviation regulations and levy civil penalties the company also depends on the efficient operation of the air traffic 

5 control system to ensure reliability of its own operations the dot has the authority to regulate certain airline economic functions including financial and statistical reporting consumer protection computerized reservations systems essential air transportation and international route authority the company is subject to bilateral agreements between the united states and the foreign countries to which the company provides service there can be no assurance that existing bilateral agreements between the united states and the foreign governments will continue or that the company’s designation to operate such routes will continue the company is also subject to domestic and international environmental regulations including rules on noise and emissions that may affect the cost or scope of its services economic conditions the demand for both business and leisure air transportation is affected by regional and national economic conditions an economic downturn or changes in consumer preferences perceptions or spending patterns could affect the company’s ability to sustain its traffic volumes and yields 

risk of loss and liability the company is exposed to potential catastrophic losses in the event of aircraft accidents or terrorist incidents although the company was not directly involved in the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks it experienced significantly increased costs and reduced revenues as a result these incremental costs and lost revenues arose from the faa’s temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet changing patterns of air travel by the public increased security insurance and other costs higher ticket refunds reduced load factors and reduced yields further terrorist attacks involving commercial aircraft could result in another grounding of the company’s fleet and would likely result in additional costs and reduced revenues consistent with industry standards the company maintains rigorous safety training and maintenance programs as well as insurance against such losses however the cost to maintain adequate insurance to cover passenger and thirdparty liability in the future is unknown moreover any aircraft accident even if fully insured could cause a negative public perception of the company with adverse financial consequences additionally unusually adverse weather can significantly reduce flight operations resulting in lost revenues and added expenses 

other information frequent flyer program all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty alaska’s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska horizon and other participating airlines and by using the services of nonairline partners which include a credit card partner telephone companies hotels and car rental agencies alaska is paid by nonairline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts with advance notice alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms conditions partners mileage credits and award levels 

mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards upon accumulating the necessary mileage members notify alaska of their award selection over 75 of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacitycontrolled seating alaska’s miles do not expire as of yearend 2000 and 2001 alaska estimated that 1596000 and 1740000 roundtrip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the 20000mile free roundtrip domestic ticket 6 award threshold of those eligible awards alaska estimated that 1482000 and 1618000 respectively would ultimately be redeemed for the years 1999 2000 and 2001 approximately 226000 281000 and 310000 roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon those awards represent approximately 37 for 1999 48 for 2000 and 52 for 2001 of the total passenger miles flown for each period for the years 1999 2000 and 2001 approximately 99000 137000 and 154000 roundtrip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead aircraft cost or profit alaska also sells mileage credits to nonairline partners such as hotels car rental agencies and a credit card company alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on alaska and as other revenuenet for awards issued on other airlines at december 31 2000 and 2001 the deferred revenue and the total liability for miles outstanding and for estimated payments to partner airlines was 1985 million and 2483 million respectively employees alaska had 11025 active fulltime and parttime employees at december 31 2001 alaska’s union contracts at december 31 2001 were as follows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below reflects certain restatements to our previously reported operating results for the years ended december 31 1999 2000 and 2001 

during 2002 the company changed its accounting policies relating to the accrual for certain lease return costs and capitalization of software development costs in addition the company changed its accounting for aircraft purchase commitments assumed by a third party and the amounts recorded for the cumulative effect of the accounting change upon the adoption of the sec’s staff accounting bulletin sab 101 in 2000 the company also made other corrections and certain reclassifications of deferred income taxes and other balance sheet and income statement items none of which have a significant impact to previously reported equity or net earnings because the previous accounting methods and classifications are not considered to be in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america the company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 1999 2000 and 2001 including the interim periods within those years have been restated see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter this report may contain forwardlooking statements that are based on the best information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements are indicated by phrases such as “will” “should” “the company believes” “we expect” or any other language indicating a prediction of future events including without limitation statements relating to the company’s expectations regarding financing new aircraft commitments there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by the company actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors some of which the company cannot predict or control for a discussion of these factors see item 1 “business risks” industry conditions the airline industry is cyclical generally speaking economic conditions were strong during 1999 and 2000 but weakened during 2001 because the industry has high fixed costs in relation to revenues a small change in load factors or fare levels has a large impact on profits for most airlines labor and fuel account for almost half of operating expenses the relatively strong economy in 1999 and 2000 has put upward pressure on labor costs fuel prices have been volatile in the last three years for alaska airlines fuel cost per gallon increased 23 in 1999 increased 54 in 2000 and decreased 15 in 2001 

on september 11 2001 the united states was attacked by terrorists using hijacked jets of two us airlines the faa shut down all commercial airline flight operations for september 11 and 12 airlines resumed flight operations at reduced levels on september 13 these events combined with slowing economic conditions had a significant negative impact on demand for airline travel throughout the industry airlines cut capacity and instituted a variety of costsaving measures also as a result of the terrorist attacks credit rating agencies downgraded the longterm credit ratings of most us airlines and their related entities including alaska air group inc on 15 september 22 2001 the us government passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act to provide 5 billion of cash compensation and 10 billion of loan guarantees to us airlines the purpose of the act was to compensate the airlines for direct and incremental losses for the period september 11 through december 31 2001 as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks as of december 31 2001 alaska had recognized 716 million and horizon had recognized 98 million of the 5 billion cash compensation during the third quarter of 2002 the united states department of transportation dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of 03 million and 02 million respectively results of operations 2001 compared with 2000 the consolidated net loss for 2001 was 434 million or 164 per share compared with a loss before accounting change of 204 million or 077 per share in 2000 the consolidated operating loss was 1263 million in 2001 compared with an operating loss of 331 million in 2000 the larger operating loss was primarily due to the weakening economy partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs and also due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks for which the company has been partially compensated by the us government financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon is shown in item 6 a discussion of this data follows 

alaska airlines revenues capacity increased 67 during the first nine months of 2001 due to normal growth but decreased 59 in the fourth quarter due to the impact of the terrorist attacks alaska operated approximately 87 of its previously planned schedule in the fourth quarter for the full year 2001 capacity was up 35 but traffic grew by only 22 resulting in a 08 point decrease in passenger load factor in our largest market southern california capacity was slightly lower in 2001 compared to 2000 resulting in flat traffic and a slight increase in load factor 02 points capacity and traffic gains experienced in the second quarter in this market were offset by decreases in the fourth quarter in our second largest market anchoragefairbanks to the us mainland capacity increased in the uppersingle digits but traffic increases were not as high resulting in a decrease in load factor of 23 points for the year our newest market seattle to washington dc which operated primarily in the fourth quarter had an average load factor for the fourth quarter that was better than the system average 

passenger yields were up 39 in the first quarter due to fuelrelated fare increases implemented in late 2000 in the second and third quarters yield was down 18 and 52 respectively due to a decline in business passengers and fare sales yields were down 70 in the fourth quarter due to a combination of fewer business passengers a drop off in demand due to the events of september 11 and fares sales offered to stimulate demand for the full year 2001 yields were down 32 the higher traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a 11 decrease in passenger revenue freight and mail revenues which were also adversely impacted by the september 11 terrorist attacks increased 24 prior to september 11 freight revenues were flat compared to 2000 but mail revenues had increased compared to 2000 due to higher yields volumes of mail shipped were lower than in 2000 but the rate increases instituted in early 2001 resulted in higher revenues 16 after september 11 two security measures impacted our freight and mail business first the limitation on carrying mail greater than 16 ounces on flights with 60 or more passengers limited our ability to carry mail from alaska to the us mainland second we may only carry freight from known shippers which negatively impacted our freight volumes the effects of these two measures will have a slightly negative impact on revenues in the future othernet revenues increased 199 largely due to increased revenue from the sale of miles in alaska’s frequent flyer program alaska airlines expenses excluding fuel operating expenses grew by 857 million or 58 as a result of a 35 increase in asms and a 23 increase in cost per asm the cost per asm excluding fuel remained constant during the first nine months of 2001 when compared to the same period in 2000 but increased by 101 in the fourth quarter primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks and labor costs explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

 17  horizon air revenues capacity was essentially flat during the first eight months of 2001 but decreased 263 in september and 161 in the fourth quarter due to the impact of the terrorist attacks horizon operated approximately 80 of its previously planned schedule in the fourth quarter for the full year 2001 capacity was down 66 and traffic was down 55 resulting in a 07 point increase in passenger load factor passenger yields were down 13 in the first quarter down 46 in the second quarter and down 82 in the third quarter due to a reduction in business passengers and down 94 in the fourth quarter due to a combination of fewer business passengers and lower fares for the full year 2001 yields were down 56 the lower traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a 108 decrease in passenger revenue 

freight and mail revenues decreased 277 in june 2001 horizon ceased carrying general freight in order to focus on carrying higheryield small packages instead this change along with the 18 impact of the september 11 terrorist attacks led to the decline in revenues othernet revenues increased 142 million primarily due to manufacturer support received as compensation for delays in delivery of crj 700 aircraft horizon air expenses excluding fuel and a special charge operating expenses grew by 181 million or 48 as a result of a 121 increase in cost per asm partially offset by a 66 decrease in asms unit costs were adversely impacted by the capacity reductions that resulted from the september 11 terrorist attacks additionally horizon’s expenses were adversely impacted by the delay in the delivery of the crj 700 aircraft from january 2001 to july 2001 the company hired and trained pilots flight attendants and mechanics and purchased spare parts in anticipation of the new fleet delivery which was to commence in january those preparations increased expenses from the beginning of the year but the total expected benefits of the new and more efficient aircraft occurred much later in the year due to the delay explanations of significant yearoveryear changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows 

 19  consolidated nonoperating income expense net nonoperating income was 628 million in 2001 compared to 62 million in 2000 the 566 million increase was primarily due to us government compensation and interest expense 

alaska and horizon recognized 716 million and 98 million respectively of us government compensation which was the amount received through december 31 2001 under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act described above under industry conditions during the third quarter of 2002 the dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of 03 million and 02 million respectively interest expense net of capitalized interest increased 185 million due to new debt incurred during the past 12 months effective january 1 2001 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 133 was not material to the company’s financial position or results of operations sfas no 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value the company has fuel hedge contracts that are carried on the balance sheet at fair value each period the contracts are measured and adjusted to fair market value the change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts that perfectly offsets the change in the value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged is recorded as comprehensive incomeloss until the hedged contract is settled and is then recognized in earnings to the extent the change in the value of the fuel hedge contracts does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the aircraft fuel purchase being hedged that portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings in 2001 71 million of charges were recorded as part of other nonoperating expense to recognize the changes in fair value of fuel hedging contracts in accordance with the new standard as detailed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2001 the company has fuel hedge contracts for 170 million gallons of projected jet fuel usage in 2002 and 2003 which represents approximately 24 and 20 of projected usage respectively 2000 compared with 1999 in accordance with guidance provided in the sec’s staff accounting bulletin 101 alaska changed its method of accounting for the sale of miles in its mileage plan in connection with the change alaska recognized a 468 million cumulative effect charge net of income taxes of 295 million 

20 effective january 1 2000 the consolidated loss before accounting change for 2000 was 204 million or 077 per share compared with net income of 1294 million or 488 per share diluted in 1999 the consolidated operating loss was 331 million in 2000 compared with an operating income of 1898 million in 1999 higher fuel prices increased operating expenses by approximately 125 million in 2000 alaska airlines  operating income decreased by 1903 million to a loss of 260 million resulting in a 15 operating margin as compared with a 97 margin in 1999 the negative operating margin in 2000 is partially attributable to a 565 million increase in selling expense of this increase 402 million is due to a change in estimate related to the cost of travel awards earned by mileage plan members flying on alaska and other travel partners capacity decreased 02 and traffic grew by 18 operating revenue per asm increased 46 while operating expenses per asm increased 176 higher unit costs were largely due to higher fuel labor aircraft maintenance and selling costs horizon air  operating income decreased 326 million to a 60 million operating loss in 2000 capacity increased 48 and traffic grew by 36 operating revenue per asm increased 17 while operating expenses per asm increased 101 higher unit costs were largely due to higher fuel prices higher labor costs added depreciation on f28 spare parts and higher aircraft maintenance costs related to the acceleration of the retirement of the f28 fleet consolidated nonoperating income expense  net nonoperating income decreased 170 million primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from new debt incurred in late 1999 and in the second half of 2000 in addition a 36 million gain on the sale of shares in equant nv a telecommunication network company owned by many airlines was recorded in december 1999 critical accounting policies the company has three critical accounting policies which have been chosen among alternatives that require a more significant amount of management judgment than other accounting policies the company employs they are described below 

mileage plan the company has a loyalty program that awards miles to passengers who fly on alaska and travel partners additionally the company sells miles to third parties such as rental car agencies for cash in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska horizon or any of our alliance partners the company has an obligation to provide this future travel therefore the company recognizes a liability and the corresponding expense or deferred revenue for this future obligation 

at december 31 2001 the company had 63 billion miles outstanding representing a liability of 248 million the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require management judgment to estimate and formulate there are uncertainties inherent in estimates therefore an incorrect assumption may impact the amount andor timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 21  the company reviews all mileage plan estimates each quarter and changes certain assumptions based on historical trends in 2000 the company changed its estimate regarding the number of outstanding mileage plan miles that will ultimately be redeemed for free travel a portion of this change in estimate was included in the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to the adoption of staff accounting bulletin 101 the company has determined that this classification of the change in estimate was in error and has restated the december 31 2002 statement of operations to include this amount in selling expense see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements aircraft maintenanceleased aircraft return costs the company incurs expenses to repair and maintain aircraft routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred for owned aircraft major airframe and engine overhauls are capitalized and expensed over the estimated life of the overhaul the company leases many of its aircraft under relatively longterm operating lease agreements these aircraft are subject to periodic airframe and engine overhauls based on the company’s maintenance program many of these lease agreements contain provisions which require that at the end of the lease either certain minimum times remain until the next overhaul or the company make a cash payment to the 

22 lessor at the inception of the lease the company does not know the balance between actual time remaining to the next overhaul and cash payments that will be used to satisfy its return commitments accordingly airframe and engine overhauls are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term additionally since the amount of cash payments by themselves cannot be reasonably predicted at the inception of the lease the company accrues cash payments expected to be made to lessors over the last few years of the lease when probable and estimable in the case of both owned and leased aircraft management uses estimates to determine the appropriate life of an overhaul longlived assets due to the events of september 11 and the impact on the airline industry the company evaluated whether the book value of its aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” the company performed an impairment test as required by sfas no 121 which was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the company’s aircraft based on this test the company determined that the horizon fokker f28 fleet was impaired and a writedown of 102 million was taken against the book value of those aircraft and related spare parts there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test if cash flows do not materialize as estimated there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future however the company believes that the accounting practices followed with regard to impairments are based on the best information available at the time
