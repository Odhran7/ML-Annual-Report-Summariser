our platform offers flexibility too customers can control the extent of their use of akamais technology to scale on demand using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as they require to support widely varying traffic and rapid growth without the need for expensive and complex internal infrastructure 

human capital 

our employees – our human capital – are our most valuable assets as they are fundamental to our innovation the operation and ongoing enhancement of the akamai intelligent edge platform the fostering and maintenance of relationships with our customers and the management of our operations the importance of our workforce to our success is underscored by the inclusion of corporate mission critical goals centered on our employees – in 2021 we focused on further developing a diverse productive and flexible work environment supported by the tenets of inclusion technology collaboration a growth mindset and our one akamai culture different aspects of our human capital management are overseen by our board of directors as well as its talent leadership  compensation and environmental social  governance committees 

as of december 31 2021 we had over 8700 employees located in more than 30 countries with approximately 60 of those employees located outside of the us and representing over 90 nationalities which we believe helps bring a global perspective to our operations our employees are grouped across the following roles with the approximate percentage of the overall population noted engineering and research and development 32 services and support 28 sales and marketing 20 and administrative functions 20 

engagement 

it is our belief that an engaged employee base is key to having the productive ethical and inclusive workplace needed to successfully compete in today’s marketplace we regularly conduct surveys of our employees to assess engagement and job satisfaction results from these surveys have consistently shown a strong sense of engagement and confidence in akamais future as akamai in 2021 outperformed the high performing benchmark comparative index used by our thirdparty survey provider an internationallyrecognized consulting firm specializing in corporate culture we have been acknowledged in respected publications across the us india and poland as a great place to work continuing into 2021 all employees were invited to participate in a companywide program developed by a behavioral research organization that was intended to help us increase inclusivity become more open to change and accelerate our innovation in addition we also work closely with the akamai foundation to provide community service and charitable matching fund opportunities for akamai employees endeavors that have been shown to increase employee engagement 

our leadership believes that one of the keys to fostering employee inclusion and engagement is through communication this approach was amplified because of the ongoing covid19 pandemic since the onset of the covid19 pandemic our chief executive officer has conducted over 80 employee town halls and all hands meetings most of which were virtual in 2020 and 2021 and our chief human resources officer has provided regular updates on pandemicrelated developments and available resources to assist employees 

diversity 

akamai is an equal opportunity employer that values the strength that diversity brings to the workplace we do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of gender gender identity sexual orientation race or ethnicity protected veteran status disability or other protected group status akamai supports varied programs and practices designed to promote a diverse and inclusive working environment we have eleven employee resource groups or ergs that offer opportunities for employees to come together for mutual support education and development ergs encompass different racial and ethnic groups persons with different physical or cognitive abilities parents military veterans those supporting the lgbtq community and women we track the diversity of our workforce and report quarterly to the board of directors on our progress to improve our diverse representation at december 31 2021 global female representation was 273 up from 262 at the end of 2020 and racial and ethnic minority representation in the us was 414 up from 406 at the end of 2020 to help us improve the diversity of our workforce we participate in or sponsor professional development and recruiting forums we also offer the akamai technical academy a global technical training program for diverse individuals gender ethnicity experiential generational veterans who are interested in pursuing a technical career path but may not be formally educated in science mathematics or engineering the program consists of akamaispecific training after which participants are placed in a variety of contract roles across our organization with the potential to become fulltime employees we also train hiring managers to draft inclusive job descriptions intended to broaden the pool of eligible applicants 

retention 

we have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries wages and benefits our compensation and benefits philosophy is to maximize the effectiveness of pay and benefits programs to attract and retain the high caliber individuals needed to drive the success of our business while balancing costeffectiveness and competitive factors our benefits programs which vary by country and region include healthcare and insurance benefits health savings and flexible spending accounts paid time off family leave family care resources flexible work schedules and locations adoption and fertility assistance employee assistance programs tuition assistance and holistic wellness programs our wellness programs include educational offerings on healthy lifestyles access to mental health experts and access to ergonomic advice and equipment to foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders restricted stock units are provided to eligible employees under our broadbased stock incentive programs and most employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan we monitor voluntary attrition in assessing our overall human capital while attrition was higher in 2021 as compared to 2020 we believe our attrition rate is lower than the global average for technology companies 

as a signatory to the white house equal pay pledge we are committed to monitoring our pay practices regularly and making adjustments as necessary to deliver on this pledge we periodically conduct internal pay equity analyses with the assistance of a nationallyrecognized outside consultant covering gender globally and race and gender in the us we take action to remedy identified discrepancies as appropriate to date no widespread patterns of disparity have been identified 

in addition succession planning is an ongoing priority for our leadership we conduct annual succession planning for senior leadership which is overseen by our board of directors including development plans for the next level of our senior 

leaders annual talent reviews focus on both high performers as well as those with high potential to keep our pipeline of tomorrow’s leaders full 

development 

we invest significant resources in professional development career advancement and training for our global workforce all employees participate in our akamai elevation performance review program for select employees we offer leadership training workshops 360degree feedback and succession planning exercises to encourage and enable internal promotion and advancement all employees are required to complete annual ethics and compliance and data security training in addition to these required trainings nearly all of our employees and contractors completed at least one training in our akamai university program during 2021 

covid19 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we instituted protocols and policies focused on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees while maintaining business continuity and minimizing disruptions to customer support and service delivery in midmarch 2020 we shifted to a remote working posture and closed all offices to staff other than employees in key functions such as monitoring and managing our network we have begun to selectively and safely reopen offices in a limited capacity for employees who would prefer to work from one of our offices safety protocols include but are not limited to mandatory training personal protective equipment reduced capacity social distancing an increased cleaning schedule and in certain jurisdictions vaccination requirements andor testing protocols we have a rigorous process for assessing whether any office can reopen and remain open based on local government regulations local health trends and business needs except for employees whose job responsibilities require inoffice work none of our employees are required to fully return to the office even those that are currently open 

in 2021 we continued many of the programs we instituted in 2020 to support our employees and contractors including our productivity reimbursement program to assist all employees with purchasing equipment to better enable remote work our expanded wellness program offerings to offer courses on pandemic related topics providing employees with licenses to a digital health platform and developing manager guidance on enabling flexible work arrangements we also provided seven paid wellness days in 2021 to allow additional paid time off for employees specifically to encourage mental and physical health in addition to support for full and parttime employees we guaranteed sick pay for contractors 

flexbase 

given our ability to deliver results while working virtually we have designated over 90 of roles as flexible and able to successfully work remotely we believe flexible workforce positions will make us a more attractive employer increase productivity enable us to recruit from a more diverse pool of applicants and present additional growth and development opportunities for our employees to support this workforce of the future we plan to roll out our flexbase program in may 2022 which will allow the more than 90 of our workforce designated as flexible to choose whether they want to work from an akamai office or their home office in order to roll out the flexbase program we are designing and developing a number of tools and resources to support this program 

customers 

our customers include many of the worlds leading corporations such as adobe airbnb alibaba autodesk capital group carnival corporation the cocacola company comcast concur crate  barrel ebay electronic arts epic games fedex fidelity investments general electric honda ikea japan airlines lufthansa maersk transportation  logistics marriott nbcuniversal panasonic panera bread paypal philips qualcomm rabobank riot games sony interactive entertainment spotify telefonica toshiba ubisoft viacom warnermedia and the washington post we also actively sell to government agencies as of december 31 2021 our publicsector customers included the us census bureau the us department of defense the us department of labor the us department of state the us department of transportation and the us department of the treasury 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue for any of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 less than 10 of our total revenue in each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10 of our total revenue in 2022 

sales services and marketing 

we market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and services organization and through many channel partners including att deutsche telecom ibm microsoft orange business services and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers referral partners and sales agents by aligning with these partners we believe we are better able to market our solutions and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry our sales services and marketing professionals are based in locations across the americas europe the middle east and asiapacific and focus on direct and channel sales sales operations professional services account management and technical consulting 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows virtually or in person strategic alliances ongoing customer communication programs training and sales support 

competition 

the market for our solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our offerings to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

• the performance and reliability of our solutions 

• return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers 

• reduced infrastructure complexity 

• sophistication and functionality of our offerings 

• scalability 

• security 

• ease of implementation and use of service 

• customer support and 

• price 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by carriers to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a thirdparty provider like us our security solutions compete with those offered by both hardware and software providers many of which are more established security vendors than we are 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent edge platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the high quality of our offerings our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

government regulation 

as a global technology company akamai is subject to complex foreign and us laws and regulations in areas such as data privacy and localization liability for content delivered over our network bribery export controls competition tax and foreign exchange controls 

privacy laws such as the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 impact how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers understand how our solutions are being used transfer data about our employees and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws other laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to among other things content liability security requirements critical infrastructure designations internet resiliency law enforcement access to information net neutrality data localization requirements industry regulations applicable to key suppliers to some of our customers and restrictions on social media or other content can have an impact on our business for instance regulations have been enacted or proposed in a number of countries that limit the delivery of certain types of content into those countries as an example restrictions were 

adopted in india in 2020 prohibiting access to identified chinese applications enactment and expansion of such laws and regulations would negatively impact our revenues or cause us to incur costs to redesign our systems to ensure compliance 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business to the extent we export technical services data and products outside of the us we are subject to us and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the international traffic in arms regulations the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries 

many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business for example while we are generally not subject to regulations applicable to telecommunications companies new or different interpretations of laws or regulations could subject us to regulatory supervision in general the nature and breadth of laws and regulations governing the internet may increase in the future accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

for further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business see the related discussion below in item 1a risk factors – we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business – evolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations and – other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2021 we owned or had exclusive rights to over 520 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2022 and 2040 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be materially detrimental to our business we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

additional information 

our internet website address is wwwakamaicom we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments thereto that we have filed or furnished with the securities and exchange commission or the commission as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission we are not however including the information contained on our website or information that may be accessed through links on our website as part of or incorporating such information by reference into this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

financial and operational risks 

we may face slowing revenue growth which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price 

the revenue growth rate we have enjoyed in recent years may not continue in future periods and could decline which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price our revenue depends on the amount of traffic we deliver continued growth in demand for our performance and security solutions and our ability to maintain the prices we charge for them 

we experienced a significant increase in revenue from our media solutions in 2020 due in large part to greater consumption of online media and games during the onset of the covid19 pandemic and associated stayathome orders across the globe in 2021 our revenue growth from media solutions declined as stayathome orders were lifted numerous other factors impact our revenue and traffic growth including 

• the pace of introduction of overthetop video delivery initiatives by our customers 

• the popularity of our customers’ streaming offerings as compared to those offered by companies that do not use our solutions 

• variation in the popularity of online gaming 

• media and other customers utilizing their own data centers and implementing delivery approaches that limit or eliminate reliance on thirdparty providers like us 

• the adoption of permanent hybrid or work from home policies by employees and 

• general macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and industry pressures 

we have experienced significant growth in revenue from our security solutions in recent years to maintain or accelerate growth in security revenue we must increase our industry recognition as a security solutions provider and develop or acquire new solutions in a rapidlychanging environment where security threats are constantly evolving we must also ensure that our solutions operate effectively and are competitive with products offered by others 

we are dependent upon the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and the continued growth and evolution of information technology we have experienced revenue declines in recent quarters from our web performance solutions and expect this trend to continue because of increasing pricing pressure due to competition and business conditions affecting many of our customers in addition in 2021 some of our customers continued to experience disruptions to their businesses following the emergence of covid19 variants these disruptions or changes in international national regional and local economic conditions such as inflation increasing energy prices recessionary economic cycles protracted economic slowdowns or any deterioration in the economy could adversely affect our business any of these circumstances would negatively impact our revenues 

our ability to increase our overall revenue also depends on many other factors including how well we can 

• retain existing customers including by maintaining the levels of existing services they buy and by delivering consistent and quality performance levels 

• upsell new solutions to existing customers 

• expand our customer base 

• develop and sell innovative and appealing new solutions 

• successfully integrate our recent acquisitions into our business 

• address potential commoditization of our deliverybased solutions which can lead to lower prices and loss of customers to competitors 

• counteract multivendor policies that could cause customers to reduce their reliance on us 

• handle other competitive threats to our business 

• adapt to changes in our customer contracting models from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach which would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us or from traditional overage billing models to ones that do not incorporate surcharges for usage above committed levels and 

• manage the impact of changes in general economic conditions public health issues natural disasters and public unrest on our ability to sell market and provide our solutions 

if we are unable to increase revenues our profitability and stock price could suffer 

failure to control expenses could reduce our profitability which would negatively impact our stock price 

maintaining or improving our profitability depends both on our ability to increase our revenue even with the potential challenges discussed above and limit our expenses we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rates of growth however many of our expenses are fixed costs for a certain amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without incurring fees to exit certain obligations early if we are unable to increase revenue through traffic growth or otherwise and limit expenses our results of operations will suffer if we are required to significantly reduce expenses to maintain or improve profitability such actions may negatively affect our ability to invest in our business for innovation systems improvements and other initiatives 

if we do not develop or acquire new solutions that are attractive to enterprises our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 

innovation is important to our future success in particular as security solutions have become and are expected to continue to be an increasingly important part of our business we must be particularly adept at developing new security services that 

meet the constantlychanging threat landscape the process of developing new solutions is complex lengthy and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop we have also experienced and may in the future experience delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue 

trying to innovate through acquisition can be costly and with uncertain prospects for success we may find that attractive acquisition targets are too expensive for us to pursue which could cause us to pursue more timeconsuming internal development 

failure to develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material detrimental effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we are unable to compete effectively and adapt to changing market conditions our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are differentiation of technology global presence quality of solutions customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases broader product portfolios longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

• develop superior products or services 

• leverage better name recognition particularly in the security market 

• enter new markets more easily 

• gain greater market acceptance for their products and services 

• expand their offerings more efficiently and more rapidly 

• bundle their products that are competitive with ours with other solutions they offer in a way that makes our offerings less appealing to current and potential customers 

• more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 

• take advantage of acquisition investment and other opportunities more readily 

• offer lower prices than ours including at levels that may not be profitable for us to match 

• spend more money on the promotion marketing and sales of their products and services and 

• spend more money on research and development including offering higher salaries to talented professionals which may impact our ability to hire or retain engineering and other personnel 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

• attract customers by offering less sophisticated versions of products and services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge 

• develop new business models that are disruptive to us 

• in some cases use funds from public securities offerings or private financings to strengthen their business to enable them to better compete with us and 

• respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies changes in customer requirements and market and industry developments resulting in superior offerings 

ultimately any type of increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships reputations commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to our customers or partners becoming our competitors network suppliers no longer seeking to work with us and large technology companies that previously did not 

appear to show interest in the markets we seek to address entering into those markets as our competitors with this constantly changing environment we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes or our core strategies could become obsolete any of these developments could harm our business 

defects or disruptions in our products and it systems could require us to increase spending on upgrading systems diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our solutions are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the proprietary and opensource software that underlies our platform that have given rise to service incidents outages and disruptions or otherwise impacted our operations for example during the summer of 2021 we experienced service incidents that interrupted the availability of some of our customers websites we could face the loss of customers as a result of recent and any future incidents as they seek alternative or supplemental providers we have also periodically experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to a loss of business and could lead to a loss of customers in the future furthermore most of our customer agreements contain service level commitments if we fail to meet these contractual commitments we could be obligated to provide credits for future service or face contract termination with refunds of prepaid amounts which could harm our business 

while we have robust quality control processes in place there may be additional errors and defects in our software and opensource software that we leverage that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software and opensource software we use in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently address multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession we continue to invest in improving our processes and systems if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that we identify and improve the quality of our solutions or systems or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems we could experience litigation the need to issue credits to customers loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation diversion of management attention increased expenses and reduced profitability 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from sales of security solutions defects in our security solutions could lead to negative publicity loss of business damages payments to customers and other negative consequences as our solutions are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind advanced malware attacks will specifically focus on finding ways to defeat our products and services if they are successful we could experience a serious impact on our reputation as a provider of security solutions 

our business relies on our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems we also rely on thirdparty software for certain essential operational services and a failure or disruption in these services could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the complexity of our business use of thirdparty software and services acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures as a result these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing revenue recognition and financial forecasting or other parts of our business we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly in addition we could face strains on or failures of our internal it systems if governmental restrictions or vaccine or other mandates due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic limit the ability of our command center personnel to work in our physical locations if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

cybersecurity breaches and attacks on us as well as steps we need to take in an effort to prevent them can lead to significant costs and disruptions that would harm our business financial results and reputation 

we regularly face attempts to gain unauthorized access or deliver malicious software to the akamai intelligent edge platform and our internal it systems with the goal of stealing proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers disrupting our systems and services or those of our customers or others or demanding ransom to return control of such systems and services these attempts take a variety of forms including distributed denial of service attacks infrastructure attacks botnets malicious file uploads application abuse credential abuse ransomware bugs viruses worms and malicious software programs there could be attempts to infiltrate our systems through our supply chain and contractors malicious actors are known to attempt to fraudulently induce employees and suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactics other parties may attempt to gain unauthorized physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our internaluse information systems we may not be able to anticipate the techniques used in such attacks as they change frequently and may not be recognized until launched to date cyber threats and 

other attacks have not resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations but such threats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them 

the complexities in managing the security profile of a distributed network with vast scale and geographic reach that evolves to incorporate new capabilities expose us to both known and unknown vulnerabilities we have discovered vulnerabilities in software used in our technology such as the vulnerability in apache log4j 2 referred to as “log4shell” identified in late 2021 that impacted a large portion of the internet ecosystem and may have other undiscovered vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities resident in either software or configurations may require significant operational efforts to mitigate and may persist for extended periods of time and the effects of any such vulnerability could be exacerbated our ability to detect vulnerabilities could be particularly limited during extraordinary events such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic where more staff are working remotely and dealing with unusual distractions similar security risks exist with respect to acquired companies our business partners and the thirdparty vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions as a result we are subject to risks that the activities of our business partners and thirdparty vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems see also the risk factor captioned we utilize thirdparty technology in our business and failures or vulnerabilities andor litigation related to these technologies may adversely affect our business below 

to protect our corporate and deployed networks we must continuously engineer more secure solutions enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network and services this is frequently costly with a negative impact on nearterm profitability we may need to increase our spending in the future these costs could reduce our operating margin 

any actual alleged or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks or any other actual alleged or perceived data security incident we our customers or our thirdparty suppliers suffer can result in damage to our reputation negative publicity loss of channel partners customers and sales loss of competitive advantages increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident regulatory investigations and enforcement actions costly litigation and other liabilities in addition we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating remediating eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our solutions and customer and investor confidence in our company and otherwise seriously harm our business and operating results 

if we cannot maintain compatibility with our customers’ it infrastructure including their chosen thirdparty applications our business will be harmed 

our products interoperate with our customers it infrastructure that often has different specifications utilizes diverse technology and requires compatibility with multiple communication protocols therefore the functionality of our technology often needs to have and maintain compatibility with our customers technology environment including their chosen thirdparty technology customers and in particular these chosen thirdparty applications may change features restrict our access to or alter their applications in a manner that causes incompatibilities or causes us significant costs to maintain compatibility and as a result our business could be adversely affected such changes could functionally limit or prevent the compatibility of our products with our customers’ it infrastructure which would negatively affect adoption of our products and harm our business if we fail to update our products to achieve compatibility with new thirdparty applications that our customers use we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need which would harm our business 

we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business 

a significant portion of our employee increases customer additions and revenue growth in recent quarters has been attributable to revenue gains outside the us our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks that may increase our costs disrupt our operations or make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

• uncertainty regarding liability for content or services including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent 

• loss of revenues if the us or foreign governments impose limitations on doing business with significant current or potential customers 

• adjusting to different employeeemployer relationships and different regulations governing such relationships 

• becoming subject to regulatory oversight 

• corporate and personal liability for alleged or actual violations of laws and regulations 

• difficulty in staffing training developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language cultural differences or regulations 

• theft of intellectual property in highrisk countries where we operate 

• difficulties in enforcing contracts collecting accounts and longer payment cycles in certain countries 

• difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries 

• managing the costs and processes necessary to comply with export control sanctions anticorruption data protection and competition laws and regulations or other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products and services in certain foreign markets 

• geopolitical developments including any that impact our or our customers’ ability to operate or deliver content to a country 

• other circumstances outside of our control such as trade disputes political unrest the imposition of sanctions export controls warfare military or armed conflict such as the russian invasion of ukraine terrorist attacks public health emergencies such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic and natural disasters that could disrupt our ability to provide services or limit customer purchases of them 

• reliance on one or more channel partners over which we have limited control or influence on a daytoday basis and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas such as intellectual property ownership and infringement tax anticorruption internet and technology regulations foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation data privacy competition and employment compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation see also the risk factor captioned other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business below 

our business strategy depends on the ability to source adequate transmission capacity and the equipment we need to operate our network failure to have access to those resources could lead to loss of revenue and service disruptions 

to operate our network we are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers the availability of colocation facilities to house our servers and equipment to support our operations we may be unable to purchase the bandwidth and space we need from these providers due to limitations on their resources or other reasons outside of our control inability to access facilities where we would like to install servers or perform maintenance on existing servers because of governmental restrictions on access due to stayathome orders or social distancing requirements due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic or other events impedes our ability to expand or maintain capacity as a result there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers particularly those under cyberattack or impacted by pandemicrelated events failure to put in place the capacity we require to operate our business effectively could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers 

the akamai intelligent edge platform relies on hardware equipment including hundreds of thousands of servers deployed around the world global supply chain constraints in the wake of the covid19 pandemic continue to increase lead times for equipment components which adds risk to our ability to flex to meet future business needs disruptions in our supply chain could prevent us from purchasing needed equipment at attractive prices or at all for example from time to time it has been and may continue to be more difficult to purchase equipment that is manufactured in areas that face disruptions to operations due to unrest or other political activity public health issues such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic safety issues natural disasters or general economic conditions failure to have adequate equipment including server equipment could harm the quality of our services which could lead to the loss of customers and revenue 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

• difficulty integrating the technologies operations and personnel of acquired businesses 

• potential disruptions of our ongoing business 

• potential distraction of management 

• diversion of business resources from core operations 

• financial consequences such as increased operating expenses incurrence of additional debt and other dilutive effects on our earnings particularly in the current environment where we have generally seen escalating valuations of many technology companies and increasing allocation of risk to acquirors 

• assumption of legal risks related to compliance with laws including privacy and anticorruption regulations 

• failure to realize synergies or other expected benefits 

• lawsuits resulting from an acquisition or disposition 

• acquisition of it systems that expose us to cybersecurity risks 

• increased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired and 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition as we complete any future acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities 

if current and potential large customers shift to hardwarebased or other diy internal solutions our business will be negatively impacted 

we are reliant on large media and other customers to direct traffic to our network for a significant part of our revenues in the past some of those customers have determined that it is better for them to employ a “doityourself” or “diy” strategy by putting in place equipment software and other technology solutions for content and application delivery and security protection within their internal systems instead of using our solutions for some or all of their needs essentially this is another form of competition for us as the amount of money a customer spends with us increases the risk that they will seek alternative solutions such as diy or a multivendor policy likewise increases if additional large customers shift to this model traffic on our network and our contracted revenue commitments would decrease which would negatively impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees and qualified sales research and development technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales research and development marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships like other companies in our industry we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications and if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects could suffer for example none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and members of our senior management have left our company over the years for a variety of reasons in addition effective succession planning is important to our longterm success and our failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our officers and other key personnel could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

in addition our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain employees such efforts will require time expense and attention by our employees as there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones and new hires require significant training this competition results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation and can have a dilutive impact on our stock the loss of the services of a significant number of our employees or any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent in a timely fashion may be disruptive to our operations and overall business 

our failure to effectively manage our operations and maintain our company culture as our business evolves and our work practices change could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations and we believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth increased usage of alternative working arrangements including the designation of over 90 of roles as flexible and able to work remotely including after the pandemic acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based 

outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters 

if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful in these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic nearly all of our employees worldwide have been working remotely since the first quarter of 2020 we plan to roll out our flexbase program in may 2022 which will allow the more than 90 of our workforce designated as flexible to choose whether they want to work from an akamai office or their home office although we believe a flexible working policy will help us attract and retain talent the longterm continuation of pandemicbased restrictions and implementation of our flexbase program could among other things negatively impact employee morale and productivity inhibit our ability to hire and train new employees and impede our ability to support customers at the levels they expect in addition certain security systems in homes or other remote workplaces may be less secure than those used in our offices which may subject us to increased security risks including cybersecurityrelated events and expose us to risks of data or financial loss and associated disruptions to our business operations members of our workforce who access company data and systems remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices which could cause the networks information systems applications and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices we may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure allowing members of our workforce to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws further if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge if we are unable to effectively transition to a hybrid workforce manage the cybersecurity and other risks of remote work and maintain our corporate culture and workforce morale our business could be harmed or otherwise negatively impacted 

our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business 

over the past several years we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations improve operational efficiencies enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives in february 2021 we announced a significant reorganization to create two new business groups linked to our security and edge delivery technologies as well as establishing a unified global sales force we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives respond to market forces or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us including with respect to workforce reductions as well as decreased productivity due to employee distraction and unanticipated employee turnover substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation in particular in october 2021 a global consortium of countries agreed to establishing a new framework for international tax reform if implemented such reform may increase our tax liabilities and reduce our profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts in the second quarter of 2018 we filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board or matb contesting adverse audit findings relating to our eligibility to claim certain tax benefits and exemptions in july 2020 the matb ruled in our favor however the massachusetts department of revenue has appealed the decision if the ultimate outcome of the appeal and other audits are adverse to us our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability and we would need to take a financial charge although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken in all jurisdictions are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported operating results in us dollar terms 

revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be effective 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual reported results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for current expected credit losses intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue significant additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending and demand and payment for our services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations these factors may combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we utilize thirdparty technology in our business and failures or vulnerabilities andor litigation related to these technologies may adversely affect our business 

we utilize third party technology software services and other technology in order to operate critical functions of our business including the integration of certain of these technologies into our network products and services if these software services or other technology become unavailable or contain vulnerabilities our expenses could increase and our ability to operate our network provide our products and our results of operations could be impaired until equivalent software technology or services are purchased or developed or any identified vulnerabilities are remedied if we are unable to procure the necessary thirdparty technology we may need to acquire or develop alternative technology we may have to resort to utilizing alternative technology of lower quality this could limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and increase our costs of production as a result our business could be significantly harmed in addition the use of thirdparty technology may expose us to thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement which could cause us to incur significant costs in defense or alternative sourcing 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable however certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which 

could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear and have not been interpreted by us courts if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost we could also be subject to similar conditions or restrictions should there be any changes in the licensing terms of the open source software incorporated into our products in either event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition furthermore opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business 

legal and regulatory risks 

evolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations 

laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to privacy and data localization could pose risks to our revenues intellectual property and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business 

privacy laws are rapidly proliferating changing and evolving globally governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data laws such as the european union general data protection regulation or gdpr and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more laws are being considered that may affect how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers understand how our solutions are being used and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws any perception that our business practices our data collection activities or how our solutions operate represent an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism or boycotts class action lawsuits reputational harm or actions by regulators or claims by industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to liability 

engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with increasing data localization requirements and new and changing privacy laws could require us to take on substantial expense and divert engineering resources from other projects we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr the ccpa or other data regulations or if the changes we implement to comply with such laws and regulations make our offerings less attractive 

our ability to leverage the data generated by our global network of servers is important to the value of many of the solutions we offer our operational efficiency and future product development opportunities our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with other firms compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

although we take steps intended to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or enduser data we store and manage improper disclosure or misuse of personal data could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or end users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to among other things content liability security requirements law enforcement access to information critical infrastructure data localization requirements and restrictions on social media or other content could pose risks to our revenues intellectual property and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business section 230 of the us communications decency act often referred to as section 230 gives websites that host usergenerated content broad protection from legal liability for content posted on their sites proposals to repeal or amend section 230 could expose us to greater legal liability in the conduct of our 

business our acceptable use policy prohibits customers from using our network to deliver illegal or inappropriate content if customers violate that policy we may nonetheless face reputational damage or lawsuits related to their content regulations have been enacted or proposed in a number of countries that limit the delivery of certain types of content into those countries enactment and expansion of such laws and regulations would negatively impact our revenues for example restrictions were adopted in india in 2020 prohibiting access to identified chinese applications which caused a reduction in revenue to us in addition such laws and regulations could cause internet service providers or others to block our products in order to enforce content blocking efforts in addition efforts to block a single product or domain name may end up blocking a number of other products or domain names in an overbroad manner that could affect our business interpretations of laws or regulations that would subject us to regulatory supervision or in the alternative require us to exit a line of business or a country could lead to loss of significant revenues and have a negative impact on the quality of our solutions as noted with privacy compliance above engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with law enforcement access requirements content access restrictions or other regulations could require us to take on substantial expense and divert engineering resources from other projects these circumstances could harm our profitability 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we have become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims and related litigation we have also agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our solutions infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights as a result we have been and could again become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our solutions or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

• cease selling incorporating or using features functionalities products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 

• pay substantial damages and incur significant litigation expenses 

• obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or 

• redesign products or services 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection particularly in some regions outside the united states we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

litigation may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability breach of contract employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings in addition under our charter we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore because litigation is 

inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance there can be no assurance that the results of any litigation matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

global climate change and related natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular remain unknown for example changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services in addition catastrophic natural disasters such as an earthquake fire flood or other act of god catastrophic event or pandemic and any similar disruption as well as any derivative disruption such as those to services provided through localized physical infrastructure including utility or telecommunication outages or any to the continuity of our our partners’ suppliers’ and our customers’ workforce could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results our global operations are dependent on our network infrastructure technology systems and website including the supply of servers from our third party partners as well as our intellectual property and personnel and any disruption to these dependencies may negatively impact our ability to respond to customers provide services and maintain local and global business continuity furthermore some of our products and business functions are hosted or carried out by third parties that may be vulnerable to these same types of disruptions the response to or resolution of which may be beyond our control any disruption to our business could cause us to incur significant costs to repair damages to our facilities equipment infrastructure and business relationships 

in addition in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources which could adversely impact our business our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development our customers investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we may incur to make our network more energyefficient and comply with any new regulations could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

investmentrelated risks 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

• quarterly variations in operating results 

• announcements by our customers related to their businesses that could be viewed as impacting their usage of our solutions 

• market speculation about whether we are a takeover target or considering a strategic transaction 

• announcements by competitors 

• activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders or rumors about such activity 

• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts 

• failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts 

• purchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors 

• general economic conditions and other macroeconomic factors such as inflationary pressures 

• repurchases of shares of our common stock 

• successful cyberattacks affecting our network or systems 

• performance by other companies in our industry and 

• geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism military or armed conflicts such as the russian invasion of ukraine or global pandemics 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a “payasyougo” approach which could make it easier for customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us or leave altogether changes in billing models and committed revenue requirements could therefore create challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of the date of this report we had total principal amount of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025 and we had total principal amount of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2027 we also entered into a credit facility in may 2018 that provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances we would be able to borrow an additional 5000 million thereunder our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes if we do not have sufficient cash upon conversion of the notes or to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness the terms of the notes do not if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

because we currently do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

• our board of directors having the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director 

• stockholders needing to provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting and 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide solutions to power and protect digital experiences the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings increase media traffic on our network effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses the purpose of this discussion and analysis section is to provide material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations from management’s perspective including to describe and explain key trends events and other factors that impacted our reported results and that are reasonably likely to impact our future performance 

revenue 

for most of our solutions our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue in addition to a base level of revenue we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of gaming social media and video platform offerings the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and geopolitical economic and other developments that impact our customers businesses seasonal variations that impact traffic on our network such as holidayrelated activities can cause revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter over the longer term our ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are key factors impacting our revenue growth 

we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

• increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our gotomarket capabilities particularly in certain markets and through our channel partners 

• we have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video gaming downloads and social media during 2020 we saw a dramatic increase in traffic growth on our network related to the shutdowns and restrictions from the novel coronavirus or covid19 pandemic primarily as a result of the rollback of many pandemicrelated restrictions we have seen the rate of traffic growth moderate during 2021 we do not expect the events of 2020 and its impact to our revenue growth rates to repeat in the foreseeable future 

• the prices paid by some of our customers have declined due to competition and contract renewals during 2021 as compared to 2020 we experienced a decline in revenue from website and application delivery solutions due to the above factors particularly in the us commerce vertical while we have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by upselling incremental solutions to our existing customers and adding new customers to offset the negative trends we expect revenue challenges from our website and application performance solutions to continue in 2022 

• revenue from our international operations has been growing at a faster pace than from our us operations particularly in terms of traffic new customer acquisition and crossselling of incremental solutions because we publicly report in us dollars if the dollar strengthens our reported revenue results will be negatively impacted conversely a weaker dollar would benefit our reported results 

• we have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter in particular we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity in addition we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to among other things the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers whether there are large live sporting or other events or situations that impact the amount of media traffic on our network and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions or licensed software 

expenses 

our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

• our profitability improved in 2021 and 2020 as compared to prior periods due to higher overall revenue as well as the effects of cost savings and efficiency initiatives we have undertaken we have also benefited from lower travel expenses because of pandemicrelated shutdowns and restrictions we will need to continue to undertake efforts intended to improve the efficiency of operations to manage our expense growth and profitability 

• network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue historically we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internaluse software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions we will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability 

• colocation costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue by improving our internaluse software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently we have been able to manage the growth of colocation costs we expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our colocation costs to maintain current levels of profitability 

• network buildout and supporting service costs represent another significant portion of our cost of revenue these costs include maintenance and supporting services incurred as we continue to buildout our global network we have seen these costs increase in 2021 and 2020 as a result of our network expansion and pricing pressure from vendors as we continue to invest in our network we will need to effectively manage our network buildout and supporting costs 

• our employees are core to the operations of our business and payroll and related costs including stockbased compensation is one of our largest expenses it is important to the success of operations that we offer competitive compensation packages however we need to ensure we continue to focus on the right investments and maintain operational efficiencies to mitigate the cost of talent we plan to continue to hire employees in support of our strategic initiatives including through our anticipated acquisition but do not expect overall headcount to increase significantly in 2022 

• depreciation expense related to our network equipment also contributes to our overall expense levels during 2021 as compared to 2020 we saw higher depreciation expense due to accelerated deployment of equipment in 2020 to help meet the increased traffic demands arising during the ongoing covid19 pandemic we plan to continue to invest in our network in 2022 which will further increase our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense 

acquisitions 

in february 2022 we announced our intention to acquire linode limited liability company or linode for approximately 9000 million net of cash acquired and subject to postclosing adjustments linode is an infrastructureasaservice platform provider that allows for developerfriendly cloud computing capabilities the acquisition is intended to enhance our edge computing services by creating a unique cloud platform to build run and secure applications from the cloud to the edge the acquisition is expected to close in march 2022 linode has approximately 250 employees and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to our earnings per share in 2022 

in october 2021 we acquired guardicore ltd or guardicore for 6104 million in cash guardicores microsegmentation solution is designed to limit user access to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with each other thereby limiting the spread of malware and protecting the flow of enterprise data across the network guardicore has approximately 270 employees and the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to our earnings per share at least through 2022 

reorganization 

we are currently organized and operate in one reportable and operating segment providing cloud services for delivering optimizing and securing content and business applications over the internet effective on march 1 2021 we reorganized into two groups both of which utilize the akamai intelligent edge platform and our global sales organization the security technology group and the edge technology group these groups are aligned with our product offerings revenue from the security technology group was previously reported as revenue from cloud security solutions and revenue from the edge technology group was previously reported as revenue from content delivery network services and all other solutions the security technology group includes solutions that are designed to keep infrastructure websites applications and users safe while the edge technology group includes solutions that enable business online including media delivery web performance and edge computing solutions 

remote work 

we have a rigorous process for assessing whether any office can reopen and remain open based on local government regulations local health trends and business needs for most locations our facilities are expected to be closed to employees whose job responsibilities do not require inoffice work we have begun to selectively and safely reopen offices in a limited capacity for employees who would prefer to work from one of our offices safety protocols include but are not limited to mandatory training personal protective equipment reduced capacity social distancing an increased cleaning schedule and in certain jurisdictions vaccination requirements andor testing protocols we have a rigorous process for assessing whether any office can reopen and remain open based on local government regulations local health trends and business needs except for employees whose job responsibilities require inoffice work none of our employees are required to fully return to the office even those that are currently open in addition we plan to roll out our flexbase program in may 2022 which will allow the more than 90 of our workforce designated as flexible to choose whether they want to work from an akamai office or their home office even after we decide it is safe to open all of our offices in light of the covid19 pandemic 

our operations have not been significantly disrupted by the shift to remote working while we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses associated with enabling remote work reconfiguring work spaces to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of employees accessing our locations and rethinking our facility footprint and the way we utilize office space we do not currently believe those costs will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily the result of continued strong growth in sales of solutions offered by our security technology group the increase in our revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes due in part to behavioral changes prompted by the covid19 pandemic and continued strong growth in sales of our security technology group solutions 

the increases in security technology group revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2020 as compared to 2019 were due to growth across our security products portfolio including bot manager kona site defender prolexic and our access control product suite 

the decrease in edge technology group revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020 was due to reduction in sales of application performance solutions partially offset by growth in edge application solutions the increase in edge technology group revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to strong traffic growth driven by video and gaming overthetop or ott as well as strong growth in our edge applications solutions stemming from behavior changes from the covid19 pandemic these increases were partially offset by a reduction in sales of website and application performance solutions 

revenue derived in the us and internationally during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the us revenue growth rates for 2021 and 2020 were positively impacted by the increase in traffic on our network in 2021 and 2020 including from our usbased large internet platform customers 

internationally during 2021 and 2020 we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asiapacific region changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by 288 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 and negatively impacted our revenue by 12 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 

for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 47 of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us compared to 44 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 41 for the year ended december 31 2019 no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in cost of revenue for 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased investment in our network mostly incurred in 2020 to support current and anticipated future traffic growth which resulted in increases to amounts paid for network buildout and supporting services higher depreciation costs of our network equipment and increases to expenses related to our colocation facilities bandwidth fees also increased during these periods due to growth in the amount of traffic served on our network 

during 2022 we anticipate cost of revenues to increase compared to 2021 in particular amortization of internaluse software depreciation of network equipment and payroll and related costs due to continued investments in our network as well as our recent and expected acquisitions we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins including continuing to manage our bandwidth colocation and network buildout costs 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020 were due to increased payroll and related costs including stockbased compensation primarily due to headcount growth the redeployment of some employees to research and development functions from sales and marketing activities as part of our march 2021 reorganization and as a result of employees joining us through acquisitions 

the increases in research and development expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were due to growth in payroll and related costs as a result of merit increases and headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internaluse software deployed on our network 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we capitalized 322 million 357 million and 337 million respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life 

we expect research and development costs to increase in 2022 to support our innovation initiatives and incremental headcount due to hiring for our strategic investments and our employees acquired through our recent and anticipated acquisitions 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the decreases in sales and marketing expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020 were due to decreased payroll and related costs including stockbased compensation primarily as a result of headcount reductions due to the establishment of a unified global sales organization and elimination of duplicative roles as a result of our march 2021 reorganization in connection with this some employees who previously supported the sales organization were redeployed in march 2021 to our research and development function to focus our investments to improve security performance scalability and innovation across our solutions 

the decreases in sales and marketing expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were a result of the restrictions associated with the covid19 pandemic that resulted in the cancellation or postponement of inperson marketing events and led to a decline in travel expenses such as airfare lodging and other costs related to inperson customer events and meetings 

we expect sales and marketing costs to increase in 2022 as compared to 2021 due our recent and anticipated acquisitions however we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an effort to manage our operating margins and to refine and optimize our gotomarket efforts 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to increased payroll and related costs including stockbased compensation as a result of annual merit increases and headcount growth partially offset by a decrease in an endowment contribution to the akamai foundation in 2020 that did not recur in 2021 

the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to 

• an endowment contribution to the akamai foundation in 2020 which did not occur in 2019 to support the foundations increased charitable initiatives 

• expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2019 including moving into our new corporate headquarters in cambridge massachusetts which increased facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization in 2020 and 

• a reduction to license patent fees as a result of our litigation with limelight networks inc or limelight that did not recur in 2020 

the increases in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were also partially offset by a decrease in amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services as well as a legal settlement charge in 2019 that did not recur in 2020 

general and administrative expenses for 2021 2020 and 2019 are broken out by category as follows in thousands 



global functions expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for administrative functions including finance purchasing order entry human resources legal information technology and executive personnel as well as thirdparty professional service fees infrastructure expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for our network infrastructure functions as well as facility rent expense depreciation and amortization 

of facility and itrelated assets software and softwarerelated costs business insurance and taxes our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning sourcing architecture evaluation and platform security other expense includes acquisitionrelated costs provision for doubtful accounts legal settlements the endowment contribution to the akamai foundation transformation costs and the licensing of a patent 

during 2022 we expect payroll and related costs of our general and administrative functions to increase as compared to 2021 as a result of headcount growth to support the operations of the business but we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an effort to manage our operating margins 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets for 2021 as compared to 2020 as well as 2020 as compared to 2019 was the result of amortization of assets related to our recent acquisitions 

based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31 2021 future amortization is expected to be 481 million 435 million 389 million 358 million and 310 million for the years ending december 31 2022 2023 2024 2025 and 2026 respectively we anticipate that these amortization amounts will increase in future periods as a result of our anticipated acquisition of linode which is expected to close in late march 2022 

restructuring charge 



the restructuring charge in 2021 was primarily the result of managements actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 to better position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions the restructuring charge for this action includes severance and related expenses for certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action in addition to the 2020 action additional charges were incurred in 2021 related to management’s plans to launch its new flexbase program in may 2022 the restructuring charge incurred for this program in 2021 includes impairments of leaserelated assets for certain facilities that are no longer needed these restructuring charges were partially offset by the release of a lease obligation for a facility previously exited as part of management actions initiated in late 2019 

the restructuring charge in 2020 was primarily the result of the management actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the associated severance and related expenses and software charges that resulted from the action in addition an 87 million impairment of leaserelated assets was incurred during 2020 to exit leased facilities related to a 2019 action which allowed us to focus on investment with the potential to accelerate new revenue growth 

the restructuring charge in 2019 was primarily the result of the management actions initiated in 2019 and associated severance and related expenses due to headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that was not implemented due to this action 

we do not expect material additional restructuring charges related to our prior actions we are continuing to evaluate our facility footprint in light of our flexbase program including our plans and ability to sublease space but we do not currently believe such charges will materially impact our financial condition or results of operation 

nonoperating income expense 



interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities the decrease to interest income for 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of investing in marketable securities having lower rates of return due to lower interest rates we expect interest income to decrease in 2022 as a result of an anticipated lower cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balance due to our planned acquisition of linode in march 2022 

interest expense is related to our debt transactions which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the increase to interest expense for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the august 2019 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 or 2027 notes which bear regular interest of 0375 but have an effective interest rate of 31 due to the conversion feature as a result of our adoption of new guidance for accounting for convertible senior notes on january 1 2022 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we expect interest expense to decrease in 2022 as a result of the elimination of the amortization of debt discounts 

other income expense net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 also includes gains from the sale of equity investments of 37 million and 72 million respectively other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events 

provision for income taxes 



the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2021 as compared to 2020 was mainly due to an increase in profitability and a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation these amounts were partially offset by an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates a decrease in state taxes a decrease in the revaluation of certain foreign income tax liabilities due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2020 as compared to 2019 was mainly due to a decrease in intercompany sales of intellectual property a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits and an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates these amounts were partially offset by an increase in profitability and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statues of limitations 

for the year ended december 31 2021 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by nondeductible stockbased compensation and state taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the impact of the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by nondeductible stockbased compensation state taxes and the valuation allowance recorded against tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 

for the year ended december 31 2019 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations foreign income taxed at lower rates the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the benefit of the us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits nondeductible executive compensation an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations 

loss from equity method investment 



during 2019 we began recognizing our share of earnings from our investment with mitsubishi ufj financial group or mufg in a joint venture global open network inc or gonet gonet intended to operate a blockchainbased online payment network in february 2022 mufg the majority owner of gonet announced it was preparing to suspend the operations of gonet we recorded a loss of 131 million during the year ended december 31 2020 which included an 110 million impairment to reduce the companys investment to its fair value due to a modified business plan and continued negative projected cash flows we recorded a loss of 140 million and 11 million during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2019 respectively which reflects our share of the losses incurred by gonet during those years we expect to record additional losses in 2022 as gonet winds down its operations however we do not expect those losses to be more than our remaining investment on december 31 2021 of 75 million 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or gaap we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets – we have incurred amortization of intangible assets included in our gaap financial statements related to various acquisitions we have made the amount of an acquisitions purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition therefore we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our nongaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre and postacquisition operating results 

• stockbased compensation and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation  – although stockbased compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant varying valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation from our nongaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies 

• acquisitionrelated costs – acquisitionrelated costs include transaction fees advisory fees due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisitionrelated costs these amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions we exclude acquisitionrelated costs from our nongaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations 

• restructuring charges – we have incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by us or the manner in which that business is conducted these charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions impairments of longlived assets that will no longer be used in operations including rightofuse assets other facilityrelated property and equipment and internaluse software and termination fees for any contracts cancelled as part of these programs we exclude these items from our nongaap financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses in addition these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business 

• amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense – in august 2019 we issued 1150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0375 in may 2018 we issued 1150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0125 in february 2014 we issued 690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0 the imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 310 426 and 320 respectively this is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under gaap thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments the debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt the interest expense excluded from our nongaap results is comprised of these noncash components and is excluded from managements assessment of our operating performance because management believes the noncash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance 

• gains and losses on investments – we have recorded gains and losses from the disposition changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments we believe excluding these amounts from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance 

• legal settlements – we have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters we believe excluding these amounts from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations 

• endowment of akamai foundation – we have incurred expenses to endow the akamai foundation a private corporate foundation dedicated to encouraging the next generation of technology innovators by supporting math and science education our first endowment was in 2018 to enable a permanent endowment for the akamai foundation to allow it to expand its reach in the fourth quarter of 2020 we supplemented the endowment to enable specific initiatives to increase diversity in the technology industry we believe excluding these amounts from nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as these infrequent and nearly onetime expenses are not representative of our core business operations 

• transformation costs – we have incurred professional services fees associated with internal changes that are designed to improve operating margins and that are part of a discrete planned transformation program intended to significantly change the manner in which business is conducted we believe excluding these amounts from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance 

• income and losses from equity method investment – we record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses from our equity method investment we exclude such income and losses because we do not direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations 

• income tax effect of nongaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items – the nongaap adjustments described above are reported on a pretax basis the income tax effect of nongaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and nongaap income tax expense nongaap income tax expense is computed on nongaap pretax income gaap pretax income adjusted for nongaap adjustments and excludes certain discrete tax items such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances if any we believe that applying the nongaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations

the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income per diluted share to nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in thousands except per share data 



1 shares used in nongaap per diluted share calculations have been adjusted for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 for the benefit of our note hedge transactions during 2021 and 2020 our average stock price was in excess of 9510 which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes due in 2025 see further discussion below 

2 may not foot due to rounding 

nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fullydiluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share unless our weighted average stock price is greater than 9510 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025 or 11618 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2027 there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges gains and losses on legal settlements costs incurred related to endowment contributions to the akamai foundation transformation costs foreign exchange gains and losses interest expense amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments gains and losses from equity method investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken generally our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2021 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency obligations totaled 22 billion factoring in our outstanding convertible senior notes of 23 billion our net cash at december 31 2021 was in a negative position of 1338 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable deferred revenue accounts payable and various accrued expenses as well as changes 

in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repayments and issuances acquisitions purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe that our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial stability and flexibility to enable us to continue to make investments at opportune times 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 3464 million held in accounts outside the us the us tax cuts and jobs act establishes a territorial tax system in the us which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal us federal income tax impact as a result our liquidity is not expected to be materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

the following table summarizes current and longterm material cash requirements as of december 31 2021 which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows in thousands 



1 excludes 672 million of obligations for operating leases that have not yet commenced see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2021 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 231 million including 72 million of accrued interest and penalties we believe that it is reasonably possible that 48 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2022 the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2021 and timing of payments from customers 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2020 and timing of vendor payments the increase was partially offset by the timing of payments from customers 

cash used in investing activities 



the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities as we did not reinvest our matured securities in order to fund our acquisition of guardicore in october 2021 the decrease was also attributable to a reduction of purchases of property and equipment as we slowed expansion of our network as compared to 2020 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquired businesses in 2021 due to the size of the acquisition completed in 2021 as compared to 2020 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities during 2019 we invested some of the proceeds from our august 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes in marketable securities which increased our purchases in that year and did not recur in 2020 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment during 2020 to support the increase in traffic we experienced on our network and expect to continue to experience in the future 

cash used in financing activities 



the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily the result of increased share repurchases effective november 1 2018 our board of directors authorized a 11 billion share repurchase program through december 31 2021 in october 2021 our board of directors authorized a new 18 billion share repurchase program effective january 1 2022 through december 31 2024 our goals for the share repurchase programs are to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs over time and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant while still preserving our ability to pursue other strategic opportunities 

the change in net cash used in financing activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to the net proceeds received from our august 2019 issuance of our convertible senior notes and related bond hedge and warrant transaction the increase was partially offset by the repayment of our convertible senior notes that were due in february 2019 and a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 we repurchased 47 million 20 million and 40 million shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 10997 9853 and 8290 respectively 

convertible senior notes 

in august 2019 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we have used and expect to continue to use the net proceeds of the offering for 

share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in may 2018 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our 6900 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019 in addition we have used and expect to continue to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we repaid the full 6900 million in principal amount of the notes in cash in february 2019 as the notes matured and no conversions occurred 

the terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

in may 2018 we entered into a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement or the credit agreement borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes the facility provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances the facility can be increased to up to 10 billion in aggregate principal amount 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 025 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0875 to 125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the credit agreement we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0075 to 015 with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 

liquidity outlook 

based on our present business plan we expect our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our expected capital expenditures investments in information technology our anticipated acquisition of linode other potential strategic acquisitions anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities in particular our anticipated acquisition of linode will require approximately 9000 million net of cash acquired and subject to postclose adjustments we plan to fund the acquisition of linode with cash cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand we also have access to our credit agreement should we require additional resources to fund the acquisition of linode or other recurring operating costs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2021 and 2020 was determined to be immaterial 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct rather they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

determination of the standalone selling price or ssp also requires the exercise of judgment by management ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately or the discounted list price per management’s approved price list in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available a costplusmargin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized 

we may also resell the licenses or services of third parties if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record allowances against our accounts receivable balance primarily for current expected credit losses increases and decreases in the allowance for current expected credit losses are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

estimates are used in determining our allowance for current expected credit losses using historical loss rates for the previous twelve months as well as expectations about the future where we have been able to develop forecasts to supports our estimates in addition the allowance for current expected credit losses considers outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis we assess collectability based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for services previously provided we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in the creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment operating lease rightofuse assets and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2021 and 2020 and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained based on technical merit the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of marketbased restricted stock unit awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our results of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds and money market funds the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes if market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from december 31 2021 levels the fair value of our availableforsale portfolio would decline by approximately 177 million 

in august 2019 we issued 11500 million aggregate principal amount of 0375 convertible senior notes due 2027 in may 2018 we issued 11500 million aggregate principal amount of 0125 convertible senior notes due 2025 as these notes have a fixed annual interest rate we have no financial or economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of fixed rate debt instruments fluctuates when interest rates change additionally the fair value can be affected when the market price of our common stock fluctuates we carry the notes at face value less an unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions a hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of income within other income expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and operating expenses conversely our revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2021 there was one customer with an accounts receivable balance greater than 10 of our accounts receivable as of december 31 2020 no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2021 the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

to assist management we have established an internal audit function to verify and monitor our internal controls and procedures because of its inherent limitations however internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013  

based on our assessment management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2021 our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

our platform offers flexibility too customers can control the extent of their use of akamais technology to scale on demand using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as they require to support widely varying traffic and rapid growth without the need for expensive and complex internal infrastructure 

human capital 

our employees – our human capital – are our most valuable assets as they are fundamental to our innovation the operation and ongoing enhancement of the akamai intelligent edge platform the fostering and maintenance of relationships with our customers and the management of our operations the importance of our workforce to our success is underscored by centering two of our 2020 corporate mission critical goals on our employees 1 making akamai a globally diverse inclusive and great place to work and 2 delivering a superior endtoend employee experience through the modernization and improvement of our technologies different aspects of our human capital management are overseen by our board of directors as well as its talent leadership  compensation and environmental social  governance committees 

as of december 31 2020 we had 8368 employees worldwide located in more than 30 countries and representing over 85 nationalities which we believe helps bring a global perspective to our operations our employees are grouped across the following roles with the approximate percentage of the overall population noted engineering and research and development 29 services and support 28 sales and marketing 23 and administrative functions 20 

akamai’s focus on the development of our human capital is reflected in our approach to engagement compensation and benefits training and development and health and safety procedures across these areas we emphasize maintaining a corporate culture rooted in meritocracy — recognizing and rewarding individuals who bring innovation creativity diligence intelligence diverse ideas and positive perspectives to their work 

it is our belief that an engaged employee base is key to having the productive ethical and inclusive workplace needed to successfully compete in today’s marketplace we regularly conduct surveys of our employees to assess engagement and job satisfaction results from these surveys have consistently shown a strong sense of engagement and confidence in akamais future scoring us in the top 20 of topperforming companies in the comparative index used by our thirdparty survey provider a nationallyrecognized consulting firm specializing in corporate culture we have been acknowledged in respected publications across the us india and poland as a great place to work our leadership believes that one of the keys to fostering employee inclusion and engagement is through communication this approach was amplified in 2020 because of the covid19 pandemic our chief executive officer conducted more than 70 employee town halls and all hands meetings most of which were virtual and our chief human resources officer provided weekly updates on pandemicrelated developments and available resources to assist employees in 2020 all employees were invited to participate in a companywide program developed by a behavioral research organization that was intended to help us increase inclusivity become more open to change and accelerate our innovation we also work closely with the akamai foundation to provide community service and charitable matching fund opportunities for akamai employees endeavors that have been shown to increase employee engagement

training courses by our employees and contractors all employees are required to complete annual ethics and compliance and data security training 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we instituted protocols and policies focused on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees while maintaining business continuity and minimizing disruptions to customer support and service delivery in midmarch 2020 we shifted to a remote working posture and closed all offices to staff other than employees in key functions such as monitoring and managing our network at year end approximately 99 of our employees were working remotely we have temporarily suspended all akamailed or organized inperson events and eliminated nearly all businessrelated travel to support our workforce we introduced new collaboration tools and techniques and instituted a productivity reimbursement program to assist all employees with purchasing equipment to better enable remote work we expanded our wellness programs to offer courses on among other things caregiving during the pandemic and vaccine information provided employees with licenses to a digital health platform and developed manager guidance on enabling flexible work arrangements we also provided four paid wellness days in 2020 to allow additional paid time off for employees specifically to encourage mental and physical health health and safety protocols have been adopted in all of our offices to protect the wellbeing of those employees who need to access an akamai location in person in addition to support for full and parttime employees we guaranteed sick pay for contractors we retain we have a rigorous process for assessing whether any office can reopen and remain open based on local government regulations local health trends and business needs for most locations our facilities are expected to be closed to employees whose job responsibilities do not require inoffice work through december 31 2021 

customers 

as of december 31 2020 our customers included many of the worlds leading corporations including adobe airbnb alibaba autodesk capital group carnival corporation the cocacola company comcast concur crate  barrel ebay electronic arts epic games fedex fidelity investments general electric honda ikea japan airlines lufthansa maersk transportation  logistics marriott nbcuniversal panasonic panera bread paypal philips qualcomm rabobank riot games sony interactive entertainment spotify telefonica toshiba ubisoft viacom warnermedia and the washington post we also actively sell to government agencies as of december 31 2020 our publicsector customers included the us census bureau the us department of defense the us department of labor the us department of state the us department of transportation and the us department of the treasury 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue for any of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 less than 10 of our total revenue in each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10 of our total revenue in 2021 

sales services and marketing 

we market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and services organization and through many channel partners including att deutsche telecom ibm microsoft orange business services and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers referral partners and sales agents by aligning with these partners we believe we are better able to market our solutions and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry our sales services and marketing professionals are based in locations across the americas europe the middle east and asia and focus on direct and channel sales sales operations professional services account management and technical consulting 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows virtually or in person strategic alliances ongoing customer communication programs training and sales support 

competition 

the market for our solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our offerings to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

• the performance and reliability of our solutions 

• return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers 

• reduced infrastructure complexity 

• sophistication and functionality of our offerings 

• scalability 

• security 

• ease of implementation and use of service 

• customer support and 

• price 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by carriers to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a thirdparty provider like us our security solutions compete with those offered by both hardware and software providers many of which are more established security vendors than we are 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent edge platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

government regulation 

as a global technology company akamai is subject to complex foreign and us laws and regulations in areas such as data privacy and localization liability for content delivered over our network bribery export controls competition tax and foreign exchange controls 

privacy laws such as the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 impact how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers understand how our solutions are being used transfer data about our employees and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws other laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to among other things content liability security requirements critical infrastucture designations internet resiliency law enforcement access to information net neutrality data localization requirements and restrictions on social media or other content can have an impact on our business for example regulations have been enacted or proposed in a number of countries that limit the delivery of certain types of content into those countries these include restrictions adopted in india in 2020 prohibiting access to identified chinese applications and proposed regulations in the us on delivery of certain chinese mobile applications enactment and expansion of such laws and regulations would negatively impact our revenues or cause us to incur costs to redesign systems to ensure compliance 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business to the extent we export technical services data and products outside of the us we are subject to us and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the international traffic in arms regulations the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries 

many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business for example while we are generally not subject to regulations applicable to telecommunications companies new or different interpretations of laws or regulations could subject us to regulatory supervision in general the nature and breadth of laws and regulations governing the internet may increase in the future accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of 

compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

for further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business see the related discussion below in item 1a risk factors – we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business – evolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations and – other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2020 we owned or had exclusive rights to nearly 500 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2021 and 2039 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be materially detrimental to our business we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

additional information 

our internet website address is wwwakamaicom we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments thereto that we have filed or furnished with the securities and exchange commission or the commission as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission we are not however including the information contained on our website or information that may be accessed through links on our website as part of or incorporating such information by reference into this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

financial and operational risks 

we may face slowing revenue growth which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price 

the revenue growth rate we have enjoyed in recent years may not continue in future periods and could decline which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price our revenue depends on the amount of traffic we deliver continued growth in demand for our performance and security solutions and our ability to maintain the prices we charge for them 

we experienced a significant increase in revenue from our media solutions in 2020 due in significant part to greater consumption of online media and games during the covid19 pandemic and associated stayathome orders across the globe numerous other factors impact our traffic growth including 

• the pace of introduction of overthetop often referred to as ott video delivery initiatives by our customers 

• the popularity of our customers’ streaming offerings as compared to those offered by companies that do not use our solutions 

• variation in the popularity of online gaming 

• media and other customers utilizing their own data centers and implementing delivery approaches that limit or eliminate reliance on third party providers like us and 

• general macroeconomic conditions and industry pressures 

we saw traffic levels on our network begin to stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2020 accordingly we do not expect traffic growth in 2021 to continue at the same levels we saw earlier in 2020 absent other significant industry developments 

we have experienced significant growth in revenue from our security solutions in recent years to maintain or accelerate growth in security revenue we must increase our industry recognition as a security solutions provider and develop new 

solutions in a rapidlychanging environment where security threats are constantly evolving we must also ensure that our solutions operate effectively and are competitive with products offered by others 

we have experienced revenue declines in recent quarters from our web performance solutions and expect this trend to continue because of increasing pricing pressure in certain verticals and geographies due to competition and business conditions affecting many of our customers particularly in travel and hospitality in 2020 many of these customers faced significant disruptions to their business as a result of the international public health emergency associated with the covid19 pandemic the economic fallout from the pandemic has continued into 2021 and can be expected to have farreaching consequences across many industries including additional bankruptcies continued reductions in technology spending and economic recession any of these circumstances would negatively impact our revenues 

our ability to increase our overall revenue also depends on many other factors including how well we can 

• retain existing customers including maintaining the levels of existing services they buy 

• upsell new solutions to existing customers 

• expand our customer base 

• develop and sell innovative and appealing new solutions 

• address potential commoditization of our deliverybased solutions which can lead to lower prices and loss of customers to competitors 

• counteract multivendor policies that could cause customers to reduce their reliance on akamai 

• handle other competitive threats to our business 

• adapt to changes in our customer contracting models from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach which would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us or from traditional overage billing models to ones that do not incorporate surcharges for usage above committed levels and 

• manage the impact of changes in general economic conditions public health issues natural disasters and public unrest on our ability to sell market and provide our solutions 

if we are unable to increase revenues our profitability and stock price could suffer 

failure to control expenses could reduce our profitability which would negatively impact our stock price 

maintaining or improving our profitability depends both on our ability to increase our revenue even with the potential challenges discussed above and limit our expenses we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth however many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without incurring fees to exit certain obligations early if we are unable to increase revenue through traffic growth or otherwise and limit expenses our results of operations will suffer if we are required to significantly reduce expenses to maintain or improve profitability such actions may negatively affect our ability to invest in our business for innovation systems improvement and other initiatives 

if we do not develop new solutions that are attractive to enterprises our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 

innovation is important to our future success in particular as security solutions have become and are expected to continue to be an increasingly important part of our business we must be particularly adept at developing new security services that meet the constantlychanging threat landscape the process of developing new solutions is complex lengthy and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue trying to innovate through acquisition can be costly and with uncertain prospects for success we may find that attractive acquisition targets are too expensive for us to pursue which could cause us to pursue more timeconsuming internal development continuing restrictions on the ability of our developers and other employees to work in our facilities as a result of restrictions imposed by governments to combat the covid19 pandemic could reduce their effectiveness including for example by making it more difficult for them to collaborate as effectively in the development of new solutions failure to develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material detrimental effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

if we are unable to compete effectively and adapt to changing market conditions our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are differentiation of technology global presence quality of solutions customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases broader product portfolios longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

• develop superior products or services 

• leverage better name recognition particularly in the security market 

• enter new markets more easily 

• gain greater market acceptance for their products and services 

• expand their offerings more efficiently and more rapidly 

• bundle their products that are competitive with ours with other solutions they offer in a way that makes our offerings less appealing to current and potential customers 

• more quickly adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 

• take advantage of acquisition investment and other opportunities more readily 

• offer lower prices than ours including at levels that may not be profitable 

• spend more money on the promotion marketing and sales of their products and services and 

• spend more money on research and development including offering higher salaries to talented professionals which may impact our ability to hire or retain engineering and other personnel 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

• attract customers by offering less sophisticated versions of products and services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge 

• develop new business models that are disruptive to us 

• in some cases use funds from recent public securities offerings or private financings to strengthen their business to enable them to better compete with us and 

• respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies changes in customer requirements and market and industry developments resulting in superior offerings 

ultimately any type of increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we and other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to our customers or partners becoming our competitors network suppliers no longer seeking to work with us and large technology companies that previously did not appear to show interest in the markets we seek to address entering into those markets as our competitors with this constantly changing environment we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes or our core strategies could become obsolete any of these developments could harm our business 

if current and potential large customers shift to hardwarebased or other diy internal solutions our business will be negatively impacted 

we are reliant on large media and other customers to direct significant amounts of traffic to our network for a significant part of our revenues in the past some of those customers have determined that it is better for them to employ a “doityourself” or “diy” strategy by putting in place equipment software and other technology solutions for content and application delivery 

and security protection within their internal systems instead of using akamai solutions for some or all of their needs essentially this is another form of competition for us as the amount of money a customer spends with us increases the risk that they will seek alternative solutions such as diy or a multivendor policy likewise increases if additional large customers shift to this model traffic on our network and our contracted revenue commitments would decrease which would negatively impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

cybersecurity breaches and attacks on us as well as steps we need to take to prevent them could lead to significant costs and disruptions that harm our business financial results and reputation 

we regularly face attempts to gain unauthorized access or deliver malicious software to the akamai intelligent edge platform and our internal it systems with the goal of stealing proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers disrupting our systems and services or those of our customers or others or demanding ransom to return control of such systems and services these attempts take a variety of forms including ddos attacks infrastructure attacks botnets malicious file uploads crosssite scripting credential abuse ransomware bugs viruses worms and malicious software programs there could be attempts to infiltrate our systems through our supply chain and contractors malicious actors are known to attempt to fraudulently induce employees and suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactics other parties may attempt to gain unauthorized physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our internaluse information systems to date cyber threats and other attacks have not resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations but such threats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them 

the complexities in managing the security profile of a distributed network with vast scale and geographic reach that evolves to incorporate new capabilities expose us to both known and unknown vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities resident in either software or configurations may persist for extended periods of time our ability to detect vulnerabilities could be particularly limited during extraordinary events such as the covid19 pandemic where more staff are working remotely and dealing with unusual distractions similar security risks exist with respect to acquired companies our business partners and the thirdparty vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions as a result we are subject to risks that the activities of our business partners and thirdparty vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems 

to protect our corporate and deployed networks we must continuously engineer more secure solutions enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network and services this is frequently costly with a negative impact on nearterm profitability we may need to increase our spending in the future these costs could reduce our operating margin 

any actual alleged or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks or any other actual alleged or perceived data security incident we or our thirdparty suppliers suffer could result in damage to our reputation negative publicity loss of channel partners customers and sales loss of competitive advantages increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident regulatory investigations and enforcement actions costly litigation and other liability in addition we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating remediating eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our solutions and customer and investor confidence in our company and otherwise seriously harm our business and operating results 

defects or disruptions in our products and it systems could require us to increase spending on upgrading systems diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our solutions are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our platform that have given rise to service incidents or otherwise impacted our operations we have also periodically experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future while we have robust quality control processes in place there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently address multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our solutions or systems or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems we could experience loss of 

revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and delayed payments and be exposed to legal actions by our customers 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from sales of security solutions defects in our security solutions could lead to negative publicity loss of business damages payments to customers and other negative consequences as our solutions are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind advanced malware attacks will specifically focus on finding ways to defeat our products and services if they are successful we could experience a serious impact on our reputation as a provider of security solutions 

our business relies on our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures as a result these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing revenue recognition and financial forecasting we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly in addition we could face strains on or failures of our internal it systems if the covid19 pandemic persists for a longer period or governmental restrictions limit the ability of our command center personnel to work in our physical locations if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business 

a significant portion of our revenue growth in recent quarters has been attributable to revenue gains outside the us our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks that may increase our costs make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

• uncertainty regarding liability for content or services including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent 

• loss of revenues if the us or foreign governments impose limitations on doing business with significant current or potential customers 

• adjusting to different employeeemployer relationships and different regulations governing such relationships 

• becoming subject to regulatory oversight 

• corporate and personal liability for alleged or actual violations of laws and regulations 

• difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language cultural differences or regulations such as those implemented in connection with the covid19 pandemic 

• theft of intellectual property in highrisk countries where we operate 

• difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries 

• managing the costs and processes necessary to comply with export control sanctions anticorruption data protection and competition laws and regulations 

• geopolitical developments that impact our customers’ ability to operate or deliver content to a country 

• other circumstances outside of our control such as trade disputes political unrest public health emergencies such as the covid19 outbreak and natural disasters that could disrupt our ability to provide services or limit customer purchases of them 

• reliance on channel partners over which we have limited control or influence on a daytoday basis and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas such as intellectual property ownership and infringement tax anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation data privacy competition and employment compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation see also the risk factor captioned other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business below 

our business strategy depends on the ability to source adequate transmission capacity and the servers we need to operate our network failure to have access to those resources could lead to loss of revenue and service disruptions 

to operate our network we are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers and availability of colocation facilities to house our servers we may be unable to purchase the bandwidth and space we need from these providers due to limitations on their resources or other reasons outside of our control inability to access facilities where we would like to install servers or perform maintenance on existing servers because of governmental restrictions on access due to stayathome orders or social distancing requirements during pandemics or other events impedes our ability to expand or maintain capacity as a result there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers particularly those under cyberattack or impacted by pandemictype events failure to put in place the capacity we require to operate our business effectively could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers 

the akamai intelligent edge platform relies on hundreds of thousands of servers deployed around the world disruptions in our supply chain could prevent us from purchasing servers and other needed equipment at attractive prices or at all for example from time to time it has been and may continue to be more difficult to purchase servers component parts and other equipment that are manufactured in areas that face disruptions to operations due to unrest or other political activity public health issues such as the covid19 pandemic safety issues natural disasters or general economic conditions failure to have adequate server deployment could harm the quality of our services which could lead to the loss of customers and revenue 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

• difficulty integrating the technologies operations and personnel of acquired businesses 

• potential disruption of our ongoing business 

• potential distraction of management 

• diversion of business resources from core operations 

• financial consequences including an increase in operating expenses and other dilutive effects on our earnings particularly in the current environment where we have seen escalating valuations of many technology companies 

• assumption of legal risks related to compliance with laws including privacy and anticorruption regulations 

• failure to realize synergies or other expected benefits 

• acquisition of it systems that expose us to cybersecurity risks 

• increased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired and 

• potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition as we complete any future acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships ther e is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and members of our senior management have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons the loss of the services of a 

significant number of our employees or any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent may be disruptive to our operations and overall business 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth increased usage of alternative working arrangements acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful in these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected with the restrictions on businesses intended to curb the spread of the covid19 virus nearly all of our employees worldwide have been working remotely since the first quarter of 2020 we expect this situation to continue through at least the second quarter of 2021 a longerterm continuation of these restrictions could among other things negatively impact employee morale and productivity inhibit our ability to hire and train new employees and impede our ability to support customers at the levels they expect as a result our business could suffer 

our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business 

over the past several years we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations improve operational efficiencies enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives in february 2021 we announced a significant reorganization to create two new business groups linked to our security and edge delivery technologies as well as establishing a unified global sales force we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives respond to market forces or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us including with respect to workforce reductions as well as decreased productivity due to employee distraction and unanticipated employee turnover substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts in the second quarter of 2018 we filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board or matb contesting adverse audit findings relating to our eligibility to claim certain tax benefits and exemptions in july 2020 the matb ruled in our favor however the decision is eligible for appeal by the massachusetts department of revenue if the ultimate outcome of the potential appeal and other audits are adverse to us our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability and we would need to take a financial charge although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken in all jurisdictions are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported operating results in us dollar terms 

revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be effective 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual reported results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for current expected credit losses intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue significant additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable however certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost furthermore opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business 

legal and regulatory risks 

evolving privacy regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations 

laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to privacy and data localization could pose risks to our revenues intellectual property and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business 

privacy laws are rapidly proliferating changing and evolving globally governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data laws such as the european union general data protection regulation or gdpr and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more laws are being considered that may affect how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers understand how our solutions are being used and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws any perception that our business practices our data collection activities or how our solutions operate represent an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism or boycotts class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to liability 

engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with data localization and privacy laws could require us to take on substantial expense and divert engineering resources from other projects we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr the ccpa or other data regulations or if the changes we implement to comply with such laws and regulations make our offerings less attractive 

our ability to leverage the data generated by our global network of servers is important to the value of many of the solutions we offer our operational efficiency and future product development opportunities our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with other firms compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

although we take steps intended to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or end user data we store and manage improper disclosure or misuse of personal data could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or end users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

other regulatory developments could negatively impact our business 

laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to among other things content liability security requirements law enforcement access to information data localization requirements and restrictions on social media or other content could pose risks to our revenues intellectual property and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business section 230 of the us communications decency act often referred to as section 230 gives websites that host usergenerated content broad protection from legal liability for content posted on their sites proposals to repeal or amend section 230 could expose us to greater legal liability in the conduct of our business our acceptable use policy prohibits customers from using our network to deliver illegal or inappropriate content if customers violate that policy we may nonetheless face reputational damage or lawsuits related to their content regulations have been enacted or proposed in a number of countries that limit the delivery of certain types of content into those countries these include restrictions adopted in india in 2020 prohibiting access to identified chinese applications which caused a reduction in revenue to us and proposed regulations in the us on delivery of certain chinese mobile applications enactment and expansion of such laws and regulations would negatively impact our revenues interpretations of laws or regulations that would subject us to regulatory supervision or in the alternative require us to exit a line of business or a country could lead to loss of significant revenues and have a negative impact on the quality of our solutions as noted with privacy compliance above engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with law enforcement access requirements content access restrictions or other regulations could require us to take on substantial expense and divert engineering resources from other projects these circumstances could harm our profitability 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we have become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims and related litigation we have also agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our solutions infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights as a result we have been and could again become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our solutions or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

• cease selling incorporating or using features functionalities products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 

• pay substantial damages and incur significant litigation expenses 

• obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or 

• redesign products or services 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection particularly in some regions outside the united states we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

litigation may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability breach of contract employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings in addition under our charter we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance there can be no assurance that the results of any litigation matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

global climate change and related natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular remain unknown changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services catastrophic natural disasters could negatively impact our office locations in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development our customers investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we may incur to make our network more energyefficient and comply with any new regulations could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

investmentrelated risks 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

• quarterly variations in operating results 

• announcements by our customers related to their businesses that could be viewed as impacting their usage of our solutions 

• market speculation about whether we are a takeover target or considering a strategic transaction 

• announcements by competitors 

• activism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders 

• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts 

• failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts 

• purchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors 

• general economic conditions and other macroeconomic factors 

• repurchases of shares of our common stock 

• successful cyberattacks affecting our network or systems 

• performance by other companies in our industry and 

• geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism military conflicts or global pandemics 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers we have introduced new billing models over the years including recently offering a zero overage plan that eliminates surcharges for certain traffic in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a “payasyougo” approach which could make it easier for customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us or leave altogether changes in billing models and committed revenue requirements could therefore create challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of the date of this report we had total principal amount of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025 and we had total principal amount of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2027 we also entered into a credit facility in may 2018 that provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances we would be able to borrow an additional 5000 million thereunder our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness the terms of the notes do not do so if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

because we currently do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

• our board of directors having the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director 

• stockholders needing to provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting and 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide solutions for securing delivering and optimizing content and business applications over the internet the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings increase media traffic on our network effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses 

revenue 

for most of our solutions our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue in addition to a base level of revenue we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of gaming social media and video platform offerings the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and geopolitical economic and other developments that impact our customers businesses seasonal variations that impact traffic on our network such as holiday shopping can cause revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter over the longer term our ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are key factors impacting our revenue growth 

we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

• increased sales of our security solutions have made a significant contribution to revenue growth we plan to continue to invest in this area with a focus on further enhancing our product portfolio and extending our gotomarket capabilities particularly in certain markets and through our channel partners 

• we have experienced increases in the amount of traffic delivered for customers that use our solutions for video gaming downloads and social media contributing to an increase in our revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 in addition as a result of the covid19 outbreak and resultant pandemicrelated shutdowns and restrictions in various locations around the world during some of 2020 the rate of growth in traffic in 2020 as compared to prior years accelerated significantly due to increased consumption of streaming media and games online and online commerce we expect this yearoveryear growth to moderate in 2021 assuming the restrictions experienced in 2020 do not continue 

• while we have increased committed recurring revenue from our solutions by upselling incremental solutions to our existing customers and adding new customers we have also experienced slower revenue growth in recent quarters in our web performance solutions we expect the trend of slower revenue growth in our web solutions to continue in 2021 as our customers particularly in the commerce and travel and hospitality industries continue to experience financial pressure especially in light of the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic on these customers operations 

• the prices paid by some of our customers have declined particularly in the context of contract renewals and large media consolidations reflecting the impact of competition and volume discounts our revenue would have been higher absent these price declines 

• revenue from our international operations has been growing at a faster pace than from our us operations particularly in terms of new customer acquisition and crossselling of incremental solutions because we publicly report in us dollars if the dollar strengthens our reported revenue results will be negatively impacted conversely a continuing weaker dollar would benefit our reported results 

• we have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter in particular we typically experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year for some of our solutions as a result of holiday season activity in addition we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to among other things the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers whether there are large live sporting or other events or situations like the covid19 pandemic that impact the amount of media traffic on our network and the frequency and timing of purchases of custom solutions or licensed software 

expenses 

our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

• our profitability improved in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to higher revenue and the effects of cost savings and efficiency initiatives we have undertaken in recent years as well as from lower travel and marketing expenses in 2020 due to pandemicrelated shutdowns and restrictions in order to maintain our current levels of profitability we will need to continue to undertake efforts intended to improve the efficiency of operations and ensure that our expense growth does not exceed our revenue growth 

• network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue historically we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internaluse software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels and serving more traffic from higher cost regions we will need to continue to effectively manage our bandwidth costs to maintain current levels of profitability 

• colocation costs are also a significant portion of our cost of revenue by improving our internaluse software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently we have been able to manage the growth of colocation costs we expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to continue to effectively manage our colocation costs to maintain current levels of profitability 

• we expect to continue to manage our headcount and payroll costs in the future to focus investments on certain areas of the business while maintaining efficient operations in others we expect to continue to hire employees in support of our strategic initiatives but do not expect overall headcount to increase significantly in 2021 

• depreciation expense related to our network equipment also contributes to our overall expense levels during the last three quarters of 2020 we accelerated our purchases of servers and other equipment used in our network to help meet the increased traffic demands arising during the covid19 pandemic and to make up for supply chain issues we experienced in the first quarter we expect to see higher depreciation expense in 2021 to reflect the deployment of this equipment we plan to continue to invest in our network in 2021 although not at the same levels we experienced in 2020 which will further increase our capital expenditures and resulting depreciation expense 

we currently report our revenue by division which is a customerfocused reporting view that reflects revenue from customers that are managed by the division we report our revenue in two divisions the web division and the media and carrier division as the purchasing patterns and required account expertise of customers change over time we may reassign a customer from one division to another in 2020 we reassigned some of our customers between the media and carrier division and the web division and revised historical results in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented 

in march 2021 we will reorganize into two groups the edge technology group or etg and the security technology group or stg the reorganization will align leaders of the two groups around our product offerings with support from a single global sales organization and is intended to position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions beginning in 2021 we will report revenue from the stg previously cloud security solutions revenue and the etg revenue from our remaining solutions separately 

nearly all of our employees are working remotely due to the covid19 pandemic and we are not requiring employees whose roles do not require inperson presence to perform their jobs to return to offices before january 1 2022 we have implemented a comprehensive evaluation process to determine whether offices in different locations should be open or closed our operations have not been significantly disrupted by the shift to remote working while we expect to incur expenses associated with enabling remote work and reconfiguring work spaces to help ensure the safety and well being of employees accessing our locations we do not currently believe those costs will materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes due in part to behavioral changes prompted by the covid19 pandemic and continued strong growth in sales of our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 was 10616 million compared to 8487 million for the year ended december 31 2019 which represents a 251 increase the increase in our revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes including from our large internet platform customers and continued strong growth in sales of our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 was 8487 million compared to 6587 million for the year ended december 31 2018 which represents a 288 increase 

the increase in web division revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased sales of both new and existing cloud security solutions to this customer base customers that have been experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the covid19 pandemic specifically those in the commerce retail and travel and hospitality verticals are primarily assigned to our web division accordingly web division revenue was negatively impacted during 2020 as a result of this pandemic it is difficult to predict the length of time and amount by which the web division will continue to be impacted by the pandemic given its uncertain nature 

the increase in media and carrier division revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery gaming and social media usage due in part to behavioral changes tied to the covid19 and higher sales of cloud security solutions the increase in media and carrier division revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery and gaming customers and higher sales of cloud security solutions 

revenue derived in the us and internationally during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the us revenue growth rate for 2020 was positively impacted by the increase in traffic on our network in 2020 including from our usbased large internet platform customers the us revenue growth rate for 2019 was negatively impacted by a reduction in prices paid by some of our customers partially offset by an increase in revenue from large internet platform companies as these companies are based in the us 

internationally during 2020 and 2019 we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asiapacific region changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by 12 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 and negatively impacted our revenue by 339 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 44 of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us compared to 41 for the year ended december 31 2019 and 38 for the year ended december 31 2018 no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increases in investments in our network to support current and anticipated future traffic growth which resulted in increases to amounts paid for network buildout and supporting services higher depreciation costs of our network equipment and higher expenses related to our colocation facilities bandwidth fees also increased during this period due to growth in the amount of traffic served on our network 

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increases in amortization of internaluse software as we continued to release internallydeveloped software onto our network related to new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services network buildout and supporting service costs due to investments in network expansion and bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of network equipment of 315 million for the year ended december 31 2019 due to software and hardware initiatives we implemented to manage our global network more efficiently resulting in an increase in the expected average useful lives of our network assets primarily servers from four to five years effective january 1 2019 

during 2021 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins including continuing to manage our bandwidth and colocation costs we anticipate depreciation of network equipment to increase in 2021 due to increased investments in our network to address expected traffic increases 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 were due to growth in payroll and related costs as a result of merit increases and headcount growth to support investments in new product development and 

network scaling these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internaluse software deployed on our network 

the increases in research and development expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 were due to increases in payroll and related costs including stockbased compensation as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling and as a result of employees joining us through acquisitions these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internaluse software deployed on our network 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we capitalized 357 million 337 million and 319 million respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life 

we expect research and development costs to increase in 2021 as we plan to maintain our focus on innovation however we do not expect these costs to increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to manage costs 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



during much of 2020 restrictions associated with the covid19 pandemic have resulted in the cancellation or postponement of inperson marketing events and led to a decline in travel expenses such as airfare lodging and other costs related to inperson customer events and meetings as a result we experienced a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019 

the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased spending for marketing programs and other expenses primarily for a customer conference that took place during 2019 that did not take place in 2018 partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation due to reduced headcount in the marketing organization 

we expect the decreased level of marketing and travel related expenditures to continue into 2021 as we continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic we also plan to continue to carefully manage costs in our efforts to refine and optimize our gotomarket efforts and manage operating margins 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to 

• an endowment contribution to the akamai foundation in 2020 which did not occur in 2019 to support the foundations increased initiatives for additional information see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

• expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2019 including moving into our new corporate headquarters in cambridge massachusetts which increased facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization in 2020 and 

• a reduction to license patent fees as a result of our litigation with limelight networks inc or limelight that did not recur in 2020 

the 2020 increases in general and administrative expenses were also partially offset by a decrease in amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services as well as a legal settlement charge in 2019 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the 2018 contribution to the akamai foundation a reduction in legal and stockholder matter costs and a decrease in other expenses due to a decrease in nonincome tax reserves these decreases were partially offset by cessation of payments to us under the terms of the litigation settlement agreement with limelight 

general and administrative expenses for 2020 and 2019 are broken out by category as follows in thousands 



global functions expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for administrative functions including finance purchasing order entry human resources legal information technology and executive personnel as well as thirdparty professional service fees infrastructure expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other 

employeerelated costs for our network infrastructure functions as well as facility rent expense depreciation and amortization of facility and itrelated assets software and softwarerelated costs business insurance and taxes our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning sourcing architecture evaluation and platform security other expense includes acquisitionrelated costs provision for doubtful accounts legal settlements nonroutine stockholder matter costs the endowment contribution to the akamai foundation transformation costs and the licensing of a patent 

during 2021 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating margins 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2020 as compared to 2019 as well as 2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of amortization of assets related to our recent acquisitions 

based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31 2020 future amortization is expected to be 474 million 438 million 363 million 284 million and 229 million for the years ending december 31 2021 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively 

restructuring charge 



the restructuring charge in 2020 was primarily the result of management actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 to better position us to become more agile in delivering our solutions the restructuring charge for this action relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action also included in 2020 is an 87 million impairment of lease related assets incurred to exit leased facilities related to the 2019 action 

the restructuring charge in 2019 was primarily the result of management actions that focused on investments with the potential to accelerate revenue growth the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action 

the restructuring charge in 2018 was primarily the result of management actions intended to rebalance investments to focus on longterm growth and scale the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action 

in addition to the actions described above we have also recognized restructuring charges for redundant employees facilities and contracts associated with completed acquisitions 

we expect to incur up to 70 million in 2021 for severance and related benefits related to the 2020 action we do not expect to incur any material additional charges related to previously completed acquisitions 

nonoperating income expense 



for the periods presented interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities the decrease to interest income in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of investing in marketable securities having lower rates of return due to lower interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase to interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our august 2019 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 

interest expense is related to our debt transactions which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the increase to interest expense for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the august 2019 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 or 2027 notes which bear regular interest of 0375 but have an effective interest rate of 31 due to the conversion feature the increase to interest expense for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the may 2018 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 which bear regular interest of 0125 but have an effective interest rate of 426 due to the conversion feature and the issuance of the 2027 notes 

other expense net for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions other expense net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events other expense net also includes a 72 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in 2020 

provision for income taxes 



the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2020 as compared to 2019 was mainly due to a decrease in intercompany sales of intellectual property a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits and an increase in foreign income taxed at lower rates these amounts were partially offset by an increase in profit before tax and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statues of limitations in 2019 

the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2019 as compared to 2018 was mainly due to an increase in profit before taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits these amounts were partially offset by the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the impact of the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by nondeductible stockbased compensation state taxes and the valuation allowance recorded against tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 

for the year ended december 31 2019 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations foreign income taxed at lower rates the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the benefit of the us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits nondeductible executive compensation an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2018 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation a decrease in the provisional amount of the onetime transition tax that was recorded in 2017 the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations 

loss from equity method investment 



during 2019 we began recognizing our share of earnings from our investment with mitsubishi ufj financial group in a joint venture global open network inc or gonet gonet intends to operate a new blockchainbased online payment network for the year ended december 31 2020 the losses recognized reflect our share of the losses incurred by gonet as well as an 110 million impairment charge to adjust our carrying value of our investment to fair value due to a modified business plan and continued negative projected cash flows we expect to record additional equity method losses in 2021 and beyond as gonet continues executing on the early stages of its business plan 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or gaap we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

• amortization of acquired intangible assets – we have incurred amortization of intangible assets included in our gaap financial statements related to various acquisitions we have made the amount of an acquisitions purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition therefore we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our nongaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre and postacquisition operating results 

• stockbased compensation and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation  – although stockbased compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant varying valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation from our nongaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies 

• acquisitionrelated costs – acquisitionrelated costs include transaction fees advisory fees due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities in addition subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amounts of contingent consideration and indemnification associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisitionrelated costs these amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions we exclude acquisitionrelated costs from our nongaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions and do not reflect our core operations 

• restructuring charges – we have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our gaap financial statements primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments we exclude these items from our nongaap financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses in addition these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business 

• amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense – in august 2019 we issued 1150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0375 in may 2018 we issued 1150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0125 in february 2014 we issued 690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0 the imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 310 426 and 320 respectively this is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under gaap thereby reducing the carrying values of the convertible debt instruments the debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt the interest expense excluded from our nongaap results is comprised of these noncash components and is excluded from managements assessment of our operating performance because management believes the noncash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance 

• gains and losses on investments – we have recorded gains and losses from the disposition changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments we believe excluding these amounts from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance 

• legal and stockholder matter costs – we have incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters and costs from professional service providers related to a nonroutine stockholder matter we believe excluding these amounts from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations 

• endowment of akamai foundation – we have incurred expenses to endow the akamai foundation a private corporate foundation dedicated to encouraging the next generation of technology innovators by supporting math and science education our first endowment was in 2018 to enable a permanent endowment for the akamai foundation to allow it to expand its reach in the fourth quarter of 2020 we supplemented the endowment to enable specific initiatives to increase diversity in the technology industry we believe excluding these amounts from nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as these infrequent expenses are not representative of our core business operations 

• transformation costs – we have incurred professional services fees associated with internal changes that are designed to improve operating margins and that are part of a discrete planned transformation program intended to significantly change the manner in which business is conducted we believe excluding these amounts from our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events and activities giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and ongoing operating performance 

• income and losses from equity method investment – we record income or losses on our share of earnings and losses from our equity method investment we exclude such income and losses because we do not direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of our core business operations 

• income tax effect of nongaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items – the nongaap adjustments described above are reported on a pretax basis the income tax effect of nongaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and nongaap income tax expense nongaap income tax expense is computed on nongaap pretax income gaap pretax income adjusted for nongaap adjustments and excludes certain discrete tax items such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances if any we believe that applying the nongaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income per diluted share to nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 shares in thousands 



1 shares used in nongaap diluted per calculations have been adjusted for the year ended december 31 2020 for the benefit of our note hedge transactions during 2020 our average stock price was in excess of 9510 which is the initial conversion price of our convertible senior notes due in 2025 see further discussion below 

2 may not foot due to rounding 

nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fullydiluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share unless our weighted average stock price is greater than 9510 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025 or 11618 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2027 there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges gains and losses on legal settlements costs from professional service providers related to a nonroutine stockholder matter costs incurred related to endowment contributions to the akamai foundation transformation costs foreign exchange gains and losses interest expense amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments gains and losses from equity method investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken generally our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2020 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency obligations totaled 25 billion factoring in our outstanding convertible senior notes of 23 billion our net cash at december 31 2020 was 1969 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable deferred revenue accounts payable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events the events related to the covid19 pandemic have not had a material impact to our 

liquidity in 2020 however we continue to monitor our customer base particularly those in industries most impacted by the pandemic and their ability to pay us for our services or to pay us in a timely manner due to financial stresses the outbreak may have caused them we believe that particularly in situations like these our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial stability and flexibility to enable us to continue to make investments at opportune times 

as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2787 million held in accounts outside the us the us tax cuts and jobs act establishes a territorial tax system in the us which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal us federal income tax impact beginning in 2018 as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2020 and timing of vendor payments the increase was partially offset by the timing of payments from customers 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2019 partially offset by the timing of cash collections from customers an increase of 288 million in cash paid for income taxes and timing of collections and payments of other working capital items 

cash used in investing activities 



the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by a decrease in purchases of marketable securities during 2019 we invested some of the proceeds from our august 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes in marketable securities which increased our purchases in that year and did not recur in 2020 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment during 2020 to support the increase in traffic we experienced on our network and expect to continue to experience in the future 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our august 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes cash paid for acquired companies in 2019 increased capital expenditures and cash invested in an equity method investment 

cash used in provided by financing activities 



the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to the net proceeds received from our august 2019 issuance of our convertible senior notes and related bond hedge and warrant transaction the increase was partially offset by the repayment of our convertible senior notes that were due in february 2019 and a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs 

the change in net cash used in or provided by financing activities during 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to our repayment of 690 million of aggregate principal of convertible notes in 2019 partially offset by a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs 

effective november 2018 the board of directors authorized a 11 billion repurchase program through december 2021 our goal for the share repurchase programs is to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant as of december 31 2020 we have 5719 million available for future purchases of shares under this repurchase program 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we repurchased 20 million 40 million and 102 million shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 9853 8290 and 7354 respectively 

convertible senior notes 

in august 2019 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we have used and expect to continue to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in may 2018 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our 6900 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019 in addition we have used and expect to continue to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we repaid the full 6900 million in principal amount of the notes in cash in february 2019 as the notes matured and no conversions occurred 

the terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

in may 2018 we entered into a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement or the credit agreement borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes the facility provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances the facility can be increased to up to 10 billion in aggregate principal amount 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 025 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0875 to 125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our 

consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the credit agreement we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0075 to 015 with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 

liquidity outlook 

based on our present business plan we expect our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our expected capital expenditures investments in information technology opportunistic business acquisitions anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2020 for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



1 excludes 136 million of obligations for operating leases that have not yet commenced see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2020 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 295 million including 77 million of accrued interest and penalties we believe that it is reasonably possible that 96 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2021 the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding 58 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until 2026 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2020 and 2019 was determined to be immaterial 

legal matters 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business we do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct rather they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

determination of the standalone selling price or ssp also requires the exercise of judgment by management ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately or the discounted list price per management’s approved price list in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available a costplusmargin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized 

we may also resell the licenses or services of third parties if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record allowance against our accounts receivable balance primarily for current expected credit losses increases and decreases in the allowance for current expected credit losses are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

estimates are used in determining our allowance for current expected credit losses using historical loss rates for the previous twelve months as well as expectations about the future where we have been able to develop forecasts to supports our estimates in addition the allowance for current expected credit losses considers outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis we assess collectibility based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for services previously provided we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in the creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2020 and 2019 and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained based on technical merit the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of marketbased restricted stock unit awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds money market funds and municipal securities the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of income within other expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and operating expenses conversely our revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2020 and 2019 no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2020 the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

our strategy 

the technology landscape is rapidly evolving driving businesses to enhance their digital capabilities to improve productivity transform customer experiences increase brand awareness and drive competitive advantage 

the network known as the internet of things or iot is now connecting billions of devices that transmit large volumes of data from and within offices hospitals manufacturing plants power grids roads schools and homes every second we believe that new technologies like blockchain are emerging that promise to surpass the ability of current methods to process transactions more quickly and deliver data and content more securely in addition organizations seeking streamlined operations digital transformation and improved cost management are increasing their reliance on servers and networks comprising the “cloud” based on the promise of agility and scale – a promise that has not always been realized 

at the same time there are challenges and risks that have the potential to disrupt progress in every industry compromise online experiences and in the most extreme cases destroy value that took decades to build security threats are growing more sinister and advanced enterprise applications are moving from behind the firewall to the cloud while employees increasingly demand remote access from a variety of devices – which we believe makes securing access harder to achieve with just traditional perimeter defenses more consumers are cutting the cord and consuming entertainment over the internet rather than through traditional cable and they are increasingly using mobile devices to view content and shop web pages are also vastly more complex than ever before with advertisements videos graphics and other thirdparty content causing speed and reliability to suffer

customers 

as of december 31 2019  our customers included many of the worlds leading corporations including adobe airbnb alibaba autodesk capital group carnival corporation the cocacola company concur crate  barrel ebay electronic arts epic games fedex fidelity investments general electric honda ikea japan airlines jetblue lufthansa maersk transportation  logistics marriott nbcuniversal panasonic panera bread paypal philips qualcomm rabobank riot games sony interactive entertainment spotify telefonica toshiba turner broadcasting ubisoft viacom and the washington post we also actively sell to government agencies as of december 31 2019  our publicsector customers included the federal aviation administration the us census bureau the us department of defense the us department of labor the us department of state and the us department of the treasury 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue for any of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  less than 10 of our total revenue in each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10 of our total revenue in 2020  

sales services and marketing 

we market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and services organization and through many channel partners including att deutsche telecom ibm microsoft orange business services and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers referral partners and sales agents by aligning with these partners we believe we are better able to market our solutions and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

our sales services and marketing professionals are based in locations across the americas europe the middle east and asia and focus on direct and channel sales sales operations professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2019  we had 3639 employees in these roles 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows strategic alliances ongoing customer communication programs training and sales support 

competition 

the market for our solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our offerings to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 • price 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by carriers to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a thirdparty provider like us our security solutions compete with those offered by both hardware and software providers many of which are more established security vendors than we are 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent edge platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2019  we owned or had exclusive rights to more than 416 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2020 and 2039 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be materially detrimental to our business in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual 

property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had 7724 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work 

additional information 

akamai was incorporated in delaware in 1998 and we have our corporate headquarters at 145 broadway cambridge massachusetts our internet website address is wwwakamaicom we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments thereto that we have filed or furnished with the securities and exchange commission or the commission as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission we are not however including the information contained on our website or information that may be accessed through links on our website as part of or incorporating such information by reference into this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

we may face slowing revenue growth which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price 

the revenue growth rate we have enjoyed in recent years may not continue in future periods and could decline our revenue depends on continued growth in demand for our solutions and our ability to maintain the prices we charge for them our traditional offerings particularly our media and web performance solutions are subject to increasing pricing pressure in certain verticals and geographies due to competition and business conditions affecting many of our customers this has increased the difficulty of accelerating revenue growth our ability to increase our revenue depends on many other factors including how well we can 

 

a slowing revenue growth rate could negatively impact our profitability and stock price 

if we are unable to continue to increase the amount of traffic we deliver over our network it will be difficult to maintain or improve our current level of profitability without impacting our operations 

maintaining or improving our profitability depends both on our ability to increase our revenue even with potential challenges discussed above and limit our expenses we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth however many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without incurring fees to exit certain obligations early in anticipation of higher traffic on our network we have increased capital expenditures recently and expect to continue doing so in the near term future as a result increasing the amount of traffic we deliver is key to profitable revenue growth numerous factors can impact traffic growth including 

 

if we are unable to increase revenue and limit expenses our results of operations would suffer if we are required to significantly reduce expenses to maintain or improve profitability such actions may negatively affect our ability to invest in our business for innovation systems improvement and other initiatives 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are differentiation of technology global presence quality of solutions customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength our competitors include some of our current partners and customers 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases broader product portfolios longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 



smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 

ultimately any type of increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if current and potential large customers shift to hardwarebased or other diy internal solutions our business will be negatively impacted 

we are reliant on large media and other customers to direct significant amounts of traffic to our network for a significant part of our revenues in the past some of those customers have determined that it is better for them to employ a “doityourself” or “diy” strategy by putting in place equipment software and other technology solutions for content and application delivery and security protection within their internal systems instead of using akamai solutions for some or all of their needs essentially this is another form of competition for us as the amount of money a customer spends with us increases the risk that they will seek alternative solutions such as diy or a multivendor policy likewise increases if additional large customers shift to this model traffic on our network and our contracted revenue commitments would decrease which would negatively impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not continue to develop new solutions that are attractive to enterprises our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 

innovation is important to our revenue growth and profitability we must develop new solutions that customers want to purchase in a rapidlychanging technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers and competitors are also developing new solutions the process of developing new solutions is complex lengthy and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue similarly trying to innovate through acquisition can be costly and with uncertain prospects for success if we choose to cut research and development expenses to increase our profitability investment in innovation could suffer and limit our development of new products failure to develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material detrimental effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we and the other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to our customers or partners becoming our competitors network suppliers no longer seeking to work with us and large technology companies that previously did not appear to show interest in the markets we seek to address entering into those markets as our competitors with this constantly changing environment we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes or our core strategies could become obsolete any of these developments could harm our business 

cybersecurity breaches and attacks on us as well as steps we need to take to prevent them could lead to significant costs and disruptions that harm our business financial results and reputation 

the akamai intelligent edge network transmits and stores both our and our customers information data and encryption keys customer information and data may in turn include individual data of and about their individual endusers maintaining the security of the information we hold and of our solutions network and internal it systems which include hundreds of thousands of servers is a critical issue for us and our customers internetbased attacks on our customers and our own network are frequent rapidly evolving and take a variety of forms including ddos attacks infrastructure attacks botnets malicious 

file uploads crosssite scripting credential abuse ransomware bugs viruses worms and malicious software programs malicious actors also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactics in addition unauthorized parties may attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our internaluse information systems cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them 

moreover the complexities in managing the security profile of a distributed network with vast scale and geographic reach that evolves to incorporate new capabilities expose us to both known and unknown vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities resident in either software or configurations may persist for extended periods of time similar security risks exist with respect to acquired companies our business partners and the thirdparty vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions as a result we are subject to risks that the activities of our business partners and thirdparty vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems 

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems and cloudbased services we must continuously engineer more secure solutions enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services this is frequently costly with a negative impact on nearterm profitability we may need to increase our spending in the future these costs could reduce our operating margin 

breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide solutions to our customers and protect their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information thereby harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets expose us to lawsuits fines or other penalties under privacy laws and other regulations require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business any of these occurrences could have a material detrimental effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

evolving privacy content and other regulations could negatively impact our profitability and business operations 

laws and regulations that apply to the internet related to privacy security requirements data localization and restrictions on social media or other content could pose risks to our revenues intellectual property and customer relationships as well as increase expenses or create other disadvantages to our business interpretations of laws or regulations that would subject us to regulatory supervision or in the alternative require us to exit a line of business or a country could lead to loss of significant revenues and have a negative impact on the quality of our solutions 

privacy laws are rapidly proliferating changing and evolving globally governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data new laws such as the european union general data protection regulation or gdpr and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more laws are being considered that may affect how we use data generated from our network as well as our ability to reach current and prospective customers understand how our solutions are being used and respond to customer requests allowed under the laws any perception that our business practices our data collection activities or how our solutions operate represent an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism or boycotts class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to liability compliance with gdpr and other laws may be administratively difficult and expensive 

engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with data localization privacy law enforcement access requirements or other regulations could require us to take on substantial expense and the divert engineering resources from other projects we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr the ccpa or other data regulations or if the changes we implement to comply with such laws and regulations make our offerings less attractive 

our ability to leverage the data generated by our global network of servers is important to the value of many of the solutions we offer our operational efficiency and future product development opportunities our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms compliance with data regulations might limit our 

ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

although we take steps intended to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or end user data we store and manage improper disclosure or misuse of personal data could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to end customers or end users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business 

a significant portion of our revenue growth in recent quarters has been attributable to revenue gains outside the united states our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks in addition to the regulatory risks discussed above that may increase our costs make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

to continue to grow our revenues generated outside the united states we will likely need to increase our reliance on resellers systems integrators and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our solutions our historical reliance on an internal sales force and other factors our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

geopolitical events such as the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as brexit may increase the likelihood of certain of these risks materializing or heighten their impact on us in affected regions in particular it is possible that the level of economic activity in the united kingdom and the rest of europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities including those related to tax trade security and employee relations as a result of brexit such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in affected regions trade disputes unrest and other political activity as well as public health issues for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus safety issues natural disasters or general economic or political factors that disrupt our customers businesses or our own operations could negatively impact our revenue and ability to offer services in impacted countries 

we entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the us securities and exchange commission or the commission in june 2016 in connection with resolution of an investigation relating to sales practices in a country outside the us in the event we violate the terms of this nonprosecution agreement we could be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the commission or the department of justice although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the nonprosecution agreement and relevant laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws any such violations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to 

offer our solutions in one or more countries they could also materially affect our brand or reputation our global operations any international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business overall and our financial results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be effective 

defects or disruptions in our products and it systems could require us to increase spending on upgrading systems diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our solutions are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our platform that have given rise to service incidents or otherwise impacted our operations we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future while we have robust quality control processes in place there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently address multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our solutions or systems or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems we could experience loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and be exposed to legal actions by our customers 

our business relies on our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures as a result these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing revenue recognition and financial forecasting we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 



 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition as we complete acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth increased usage of alternative working arrangements acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful in these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business 

over the past several years we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations improve operational efficiencies enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives respond to market forces or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us including with respect to workforce reductions as well as decreased productivity due to employee distraction and unanticipated employee turnover substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and members of our senior management have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent may be disruptive to our operations and overall business 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we have become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims and related litigation we have also agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our solutions infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights as a result we have been and could again become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our solutions or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 



 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable however certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost furthermore opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business 

our business strategy depends on the ability to source adequate transmission capacity and the servers we need to operate our network failure to have access to those resources could lead to loss of revenue and service disruptions 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers particularly those under cyberattack failure to put in place the capacity we require to operate our business effectively could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers the akamai intelligent edge platform relies on hundreds of thousands of servers deployed around the world disruptions in our supply chain could prevent us from purchasing servers at attractive prices or at all for example it may be difficult to purchase servers and other equipment that are manufactured in areas that face disruptions to operations due to unrest or other political activity public health issues for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the novel coronavirus safety issues natural disasters or general economic conditions failure to have adequate server deployment could harm the quality of our services which could lead to the loss of customers and revenue 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers we have introduced new billing models over the years including recently offering a zero overage plan that eliminates surcharges for certain traffic in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach which could make it easier for customers to reduce the amount of business they do with us or leave altogether changes in billing models and committed revenue requirements could therefore create challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue significant additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts in the second quarter of 2018 we filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board contesting adverse audit findings relating to our eligibility to claim certain tax benefits and exemptions the appeal hearing was held in late 2019 if the outcome of this appeal and other audits are adverse to us our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability and we would need to take a financial charge although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken in all jurisdictions are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of the date of this report we had total par value of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2027 and we had total par value of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025 we also entered into a credit facility in may 2018 that provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances we would be able to borrow an additional 5000 million thereunder our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness the terms of the notes do not do so if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

litigation may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability breach of contract employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings in addition under our charter we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance there can be no assurance that the results of any litigation matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

global climate change and related natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular remain unknown changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services catastrophic natural disasters could negatively impact our office locations in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development our customers investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we may incur to make our network more energyefficient and comply with any new regulations could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

because we currently do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide solutions for securing delivering and optimizing content and business applications over the internet the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our security and performance offerings increase media traffic on our network effectively managing the prices we charge for our solutions develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses 

revenue 

for most of our solutions our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue in addition to a base level of revenue we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of gaming social media and video platform offerings the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business the ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are also key factors impacting our revenue growth 

we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expenses 

our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

 

 

 

 

 

we report our revenue in two divisions the web division and the media and carrier division revenue by division is a customerfocused reporting view that reflects revenue from customers that are managed by the division as the purchasing patterns and required account expertise of customers change over time we may reassign a customer from one division to another in 2019 we reassigned some of our customers from the media and carrier division to the web division and revised historical results in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes including from our large internet platform customers and continued strong growth in sales of our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 was 8487 million  compared to 6587 million for the year ended december 31 2018  which represents a 288 increase the increase in our revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes increased sales of our new product offerings and continued strong growth in our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 was 6587 million  compared to 4876 million for the year ended december 31 2017  which represents a 351 increase 

the increase in web division revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased sales of both new and existing cloud security solutions to this customer base the increase in web division revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to increased purchases of new solutions and upgrades to existing services by this customer base increased sales of our cloud security solutions to web division customers in particular our kona site defender prolexic and managed security solutions as well as our new bot manager offering were a principal contributor to our overall revenue growth in 2018 

the increase in media and carrier division revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018  as well as 2018 as compared to 2017  was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery and gaming customers and sales of cloud security solutions to this customer base 

revenue derived in the us and internationally during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the us growth rate for 2019 was negatively impacted by a reduction in prices paid by some of our customers partially offset by an increase in revenue from our large internet platform customers as these customers are based in the us for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 41 of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us compared to 38 for the year ended december 31 2018  and 34 for the year ended december 31 2017  no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods 

internationally during 2019 and 2018  we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asiapacific region changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by 339 million in 2019 as compared to 2018  and positively impacted our revenue by 112 million in 2018 as compared to 2017  

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increases in 

 

these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of network equipment of 315 million for the year ended december 31 2019 due to software and hardware initiatives we implemented to manage our global network more efficiently resulting in an increase in the expected average useful life of our network assets primarily servers from four to five years effective january 1 2019 

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in amortization of internaluse software as we continued to release internallydeveloped software onto our network related to new product launches and significant enhancements to our existing services throughout 2017 and 2018 payroll and related costs as well as stockbased compensation due to increased hiring in our services team in 2017 to support revenue growth and amounts paid for network buildout and supporting services related to installation fees and investments in our network these increases were partially offset by decreases in our bandwidth and colocation fees as we have been able to more effectively manage our network and reduce our costs 

during 2020 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins including continuing to manage our bandwidth and colocation costs we do anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs to increase in 2020 as we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018  as well as 2018 as compared to 2017  were due to increases in payroll and related costs including stockbased compensation as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling and as a result of employees joining us through acquisitions these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internaluse software deployed on our network 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  we capitalized 337 million  319 million and 268 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life 

we expect research and development costs to increase in 2020 as we maintain our focus on innovation however we do not expect these costs to increase as a percentage of revenue 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased spending for marketing programs and other expenses primarily for a customer conference that took place during 2019 that did not take place in 2018 partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation due to reduced headcount in the marketing organization the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to growth in payroll and related costs from headcount increases in 2017 to support our divisions gotomarket strategies in pursuit of growth opportunities 

during 2020 we do not expect significant increases in sales and marketing expenses as we plan to continue to carefully manage costs in an our efforts to refine and optimize our gotomarket efforts and improve operating margins 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  



the decrease in general and administrative expenses for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to 

 

these decreases were partially offset by cessation of payments to us under the terms of a litigation settlement agreement with limelight networks inc or limelight 

our general and administrative expenses increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to the onetime endowment contribution to the akamai foundation legal and stockholder matter costs related to a settlement charge from our litigation with limelight amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services provided in connection with a nonroutine stockholder matter and higher stockbased compensation expense primarily due to performancebased awards that experienced higher achievement in 2018 as compared to 2017 

general and administrative expenses for 2019 and 2018 are broken out by category as follows in thousands 



global functions expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for administrative functions including finance purchasing order entry human resources legal information technology and executive personnel as well as thirdparty professional service fees infrastructure expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for our network infrastructure functions as well as facility rent expense depreciation and amortization of facility and itrelated assets software and softwarerelated costs business insurance and taxes our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning sourcing architecture evaluation and platform security other expense includes acquisitionrelated costs provision for doubtful accounts legal settlements nonroutine stockholder matter costs the endowment of the akamai foundation transformation costs and the licensing of a patent 

during 2020 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins and in particular assessing opportunities to reduce thirdparty spending and increase automation of manual tasks 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2019 as compared to 2018  as well as 2018 as compared to 2017  was the result of amortization of assets related to our recent acquisitions 

based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31 2019  future amortization is expected to be approximately 410 million  362 million  310 million  239 million and 166 million for the years ending december 31 2020  2021  2022  2023 and 2024  respectively 

restructuring charge 



the restructuring charge in 2019 was primarily the result of management actions to focus on investments with the potential to accelerate revenue growth the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action 

the restructuring charge in 2018 was primarily the result of management actions intended to rebalance investments to focus on longterm growth and scale the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action 

the restructuring charge in 2017 was primarily the result of management actions intended to shift focus to more critical areas of the business and away from products that have not seen expected commercial success the restructuring was also intended to facilitate cost efficiencies and savings the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount and facility reductions and certain capitalized internaluse software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and implemented due to this action 

in addition to the actions described above we have also recognized restructuring charges for redundant employees facilities and contracts associated with completed acquisitions 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of 40 million to 70 million in 2020 as a result of the action committed to in the fourth quarter of 2019 

nonoperating income expense 



for the periods presented interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities the increase to interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of increased cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our august 2019 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 the increase to interest income in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our may 2018 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 

interest expense is related to our debt transactions which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the increase to interest expense for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the august 2019 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 which bear regular interest of 0375 but have an effective interest rate of 31 due to the conversion feature the increase to interest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the may 2018 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 which bear regular interest of 0125 but have an effective interest rate of 426 due to the conversion feature 

other expense income net for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions other expense income net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events other expense income net also includes gains and losses from certain equity investments 

provision for income taxes 



the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2019 as compared to 2018 was mainly due to an increase in profit before taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state credits these amounts were partially offset by the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates and the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 as compared to 2017 was mainly due to the reduction in the us federal statutory tax rate from 350 to 210 as part of the us tax cuts and jobs act or tcja that was enacted in december 2017 an increase in the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the net impact of the tcja recorded in 2017 these amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and an increase in nondeductible executive compensation 

for the year ended december 31 2019 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations foreign income taxed at lower rates the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the benefit of the us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets related to state tax credits nondeductible executive compensation an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2018 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation a decrease in the provisional amount of the onetime transition tax that was recorded in 2017 the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes of limitations and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the remeasurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization due to the tcja which was enacted in december 2017 the impact of the release of the acquisitionrelated reserve due to the expiration of the local statute of limitations and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these amounts were partially offset by a provisional charge for the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings taken as part of the tcja the effects of stockbased compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

refer to note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations 

loss from equity method investment 



during 2019 we started recognizing our share of earnings from our previously announced investment with mitsubishi ufj financial group or mufg our investment with mufg established a joint venture gonet to offer a new blockchainbased online payment network we recorded a loss of 11 million dollars which reflects our share of the losses incurred by gonet we expect to record additional losses in 2020 and beyond as gonet continues executing on the early stages of its business plan 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or gaap we provide additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income per diluted share to nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 shares in thousands 



1 may not foot due to rounding 

nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fullydiluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than 9510 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025 or 11618 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2027 there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges gains and losses on legal settlements costs from professional service providers related to a nonroutine stockholder matter costs incurred related to the endowment of the akamai foundation transformation costs foreign exchange gains and losses interest expense amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments gains and losses from equity method investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken generally our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2019  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency obligations totaled 24 billion  factoring in our outstanding convertible senior notes of 23 billion our net cash at december 31 2019 was 724 million  we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable deferred revenue accounts payable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive 

differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business 

as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 2554 million held in accounts outside the us the tcja establishes a territorial tax system in the us which provides companies with the potential ability to repatriate earnings with minimal us federal income tax impact beginning in 2018 as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2019 partially offset by the timing of cash collections from customers an increase of 288 million in cash paid for income taxes and timing of collections and payments of other working capital items 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased profitability in 2018 lower cash paid for income taxes due to a lower us federal statutory tax rate due to the application of the tcja during 2018 and the timing of collections and payments of other working capital items the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by a onetime contribution to the akamai foundation of 500 million as well as higher annual bonus payouts in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017 due to increased headcount from hiring in 2017 

cash used in investing activities 



the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in purchases of marketable securities with the proceeds from our august 2019 issuance of convertible senior notes cash paid for acquired companies in 2019 increased capital expenditures and cash invested in an equity method investment 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by marketable securities activities in 2017 we did not reinvest all proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities which created a cash inflow in that year the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by the cash paid in 2017 for the acquisitions of nominum inc and soasta inc 

cash used in provided by financing activities 



the change in net cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to our repayment of 690 million of aggregate principal of convertible notes in 2019 partially offset by a decrease in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs 

the change in net cash used in or provided by financing activities during 2018 as compared to 2017 was the result of our issuance of convertible senior notes issued in may 2018 and related note hedge and warrant transactions the increase was partially offset by an increase in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs 

in february 2016 the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program that was effective from february 2016 through december 2018 in march 2018 the board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization by 4167 million  such that the amount that was authorized and available for repurchase in 2018 was 7500 million  subsequently effective november 2018 the board of directors authorized an additional 11 billion repurchase program through december 2021 our goal for the share repurchase programs is to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant 

during 2019  2018 and 2017  we repurchased 40 million  102 million and 69 million shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 8290  7354 and 5259  respectively these repurchases have contributed to a decrease to shares outstanding over the past three years 

convertible senior notes 

in august 2019 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2027 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in may 2018 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our 6900 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019 in addition we have used and expect to continue to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the notes were classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 we repaid the full 6900 million in principal amount of the notes in cash in february 2019 as the notes matured and no conversions occurred 

the terms of the notes and the hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

revolving credit facility 

in may 2018 we entered into a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement or the credit agreement borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes the facility provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances the facility can be increased to up to 10 billion in aggregate principal amount 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 025 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0875 to 125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the credit agreement we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0075 to 015 with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2019  

liquidity outlook 

based on our present business plan we expect our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our expected capital expenditures investments in information technology and facility expansion opportunistic business acquisitions anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2019  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



1 excludes 137 million of obligations for operating leases that have not yet commenced see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2019  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  326 million  including  78 million of accrued interest and penalties we believe that it is reasonably possible that 28 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2020 the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding 74 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until 2026  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2019 and 2018 was determined to be immaterial 

legal matters 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business we do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct rather they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

determination of the standalone selling price or ssp also requires the exercise of judgment by management ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately or the discounted list price per management’s approved price list in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available a costplusmargin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized 

we may also resell the licenses or services of third parties if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves primarily consist of allowances for doubtful accounts increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

estimates are used in determining our reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is 

estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2019 and 2018  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is morelikelythannot that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained based on technical merit the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of marketbased restricted stock unit awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance 

conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds and money market funds the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of income within other expense income net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and operating expenses conversely our revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2019 and 2018  no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2019  the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

sales service and marketing 

we market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and service organization and through many channel partners including att deutsche telecom ibm orange business services and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers referral partners and sales agents by aligning with these partners we believe we are better able to market our solutions and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry

competition 

the market for our solutions is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our offerings to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 • price 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a thirdparty provider like us 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent edge platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2018  we owned or had exclusive rights to more than 375 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2019 and 2037 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be materially detrimental to our business in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had 7519  fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work 

additional information 

akamai was incorporated in delaware in 1998 and we have our corporate headquarters at 150 broadway cambridge massachusetts our internet website address is wwwakamaicom we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments thereto that we have filed or furnished with the securities and exchange commission or the commission as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission we are not however including the information contained on our website or information that may be accessed through links on our website as part of or incorporating such information by reference into this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a    risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

we may face slowing revenue growth which could negatively impact our profitability and stock price 

in future periods our revenue growth may not continue in particular our percentage revenue growth rate in 2019 is likely to be lower than in recent years our revenue depends on the continued growth of demand for our solutions and our ability to maintain the prices we charge for our solutions our traditional offerings particularly our media and web performance services are subject to increasing pricing pressure in certain verticals due to competition and business conditions affecting those customers inability to maintain prices negatively impacts our profitability our revenue results may also fluctuate for many other reasons including the following 

  

 

we may be unable to maintain or improve our current level of profitability 

our ability to maintain or improve our profitability is contingent on our ability to increase our revenue and limit our expenses we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth however many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without incurring fees to exit certain obligations early as a result leveraging the akamai intelligent edge platform by increasing the amount of traffic we deliver is key to profitable revenue growth numerous factors can impact traffic growth including 

 

if we are unable to increase revenue and limit expenses our results of operations would suffer 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product and service offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are differentiation of technology global presence customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength our competitors include some of our current partners and customers 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases broader product portfolios longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 

existing and potential customers may not purchase our solutions or may limit their use of them because they 

 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not continue to develop new solutions that are attractive to enterprises our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 

it is important to our revenue growth and profitability that we enter into new business areas that present significant valuegenerating investment opportunities we must do so in a rapidlychanging technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers where competitors may develop products and services that are or may be viewed as better than ours and where it can be costly to acquire other companies the process of developing new solutions is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue there is often a lengthy period between commencing development initiatives and bringing new or improved solutions to market during this time technology preferences customer demand and the market for our solutions or those introduced by our competitors may move in directions that we had not anticipated when we decided to pursue such initiatives furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning timing or execution technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources 

failure to invest in areas that can potentially provide a positive return or to adequately develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us and an inability to keep pace with rapid technological and market changes could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

cybersecurity breaches and attacks on our platform could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business financial results and reputation 

in the regular course of business we transmit and store our customers information data and encryption keys as well as our own customer information and data may in turn include individual data of and about their endusers maintaining the security and availability of our solutions network and internal it systems and the security of information we hold is a critical issue for us and our customers internetbased attacks on our customers and our own network are frequent and take a variety of forms including ddos attacks infrastructure attacks botnets malicious file uploads crosssite scripting credential abuse ransomware bugs viruses worms and malicious software programs malicious actors can attempt to fraudulently induce employees or suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactics in addition unauthorized parties may attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems 

cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in an environment over long periods of time cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide solutions to our customers and protect their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information thereby harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets expose us to fines or other penalties require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems and our cloudbased services we must continuously engineer more secure solutions enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our solutions data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of our solutions or to use competing products or services 

similar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the thirdparty vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions as a result we are subject to risks that the activities of our business partners and thirdparty vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not 

successful it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition as we complete acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete are constantly evolving which makes our future business strategies practices and results difficult to predict 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete have grown significantly over the life of our company and continue to evolve rapidly in response to new technological advances changing business models and other factors we and the other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to 

 

the internet itself is constantly evolving there could develop an inflection point above which global usage of the internet increases to a level that causes our current approaches to the delivery of content and applications to no longer be sustainable at current levels of profitability or at all 

with this constantly changing environment our future business strategies practices and results may be difficult to predict and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes any of these developments could harm our business 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth increased usage of alternative working arrangements acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful in these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our it and operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures as a result these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business 

over the past several years we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations improve operational efficiencies enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies 

optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives respond to market forces or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us including with respect to workforce reductions as well as decreased productivity due to employee distraction and unanticipated employee turnover substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones in making employment decisions particularly in our industry job candidates and current personnel often consider the value of stockbased compensation in recent years we have increasingly linked compensation levels to corporate performance metrics declines in the price of our stock or failure to achieve annual revenue and profitability metrics could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees 

none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which if they occur may be disruptive to our operations and detrimental to our future outlook the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our solutions 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our solutions beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our solutions in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a minimum revenue commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would create additional challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

defects or disruptions in our solutions could diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our solutions are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our platform that have given rise to service incidents or otherwise impacted our operations we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future while we have robust quality control processes in place there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently address multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our solutions or systems or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems we could experience loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and be exposed to legal actions by our customers 

we may experience insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in disruptions to our services and loss of revenue 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers particularly those under cyberattack the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business natural disasters networks imposing traffic limits or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations in some regions network providers may choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices this risk is heightened where market power is concentrated with one or a few major networks we also may be unable to move quickly enough to augment capacity to reflect growing traffic or security demands failure to put in place the capacity we require to operate our business effectively could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers 

we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our operations internationally as a result we are increasingly subject to risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

geopolitical events such as the united kingdoms pending withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as brexit may increase the likelihood of certain of these risks materializing or heighten their impact on us in affected regions in particular it is possible that the level of economic activity in the united kingdom and the rest of europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities including those related to tax trade security and employee relations as a result of brexit such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in affected regions 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others 

 

we entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the us securities and exchange commission or the commission in june 2016 in connection with the previouslydisclosed investigation relating to sales practices in a country outside the us in the event we violate the terms of this nonprosecution agreement we could be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the commission or the department of justice although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the nonprosecution agreement and relevant laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws any such violations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries they could also materially affect our brand or reputation our global operations any international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business overall and our financial results 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could negatively impact our business it is unclear whether potential changes to regulations previously adopted by the us federal communications commission that govern certain aspects of the operation of the internet such as content blocking and throttling and paid prioritization will be adopted and if adopted how they would apply to content delivery network providers like us it is also uncertain how future regulatory and legislative initiatives or changes will impact our business 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could expose us to increased liability 

privacy laws are rapidly proliferating changing and evolving globally governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data new laws such as the european union general data protection regulation or gdpr and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our solultions are being used and to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and how we use data generated from our network any perception that our business practices our data collection activities or how our splutions operate represent an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism or boycotts class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to liability compliance with gdpr and other laws may be administratively difficult and expensive 

we also have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning our collection use and disclosure of customer and user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims including those that may arise under international laws in many cases we have agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our solutions infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our solutions or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or channel or strategic partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable however certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost furthermore opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business 

we may be unsuccessful at developing and maintaining strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenue which could significantly limit our longterm growth 

achieving future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators product makers and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenue if we become reliant on a small number of large partners any termination of our relationship with one of them could have an adverse impact on our financial condition the need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the us we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our solutions our historical reliance on an internal sales force and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and solutions and ensuring that they are compliant with our ethical expectations requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channels those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue significant additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts in the second quarter of 2018 we filed an appeal with the massachusetts appellate tax board contesting adverse audit findings relating to our eligibility to claim certain tax benefits and exemptions if the outcome of this appeal and other audits are adverse to us our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability and we would need to take a financial charge although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken in all jurisdictions are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will be required to expend significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of the date of this report we had total par value of 11500 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2025 we also entered into a credit facility in may 2018 that provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances we would be able to borrow an additional 5000 million thereunder our ability to repay any amounts we borrow under our credit facility refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the applicable indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through future borrowing under the credit facility or 

the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business although the terms of our credit facility include certain financial ratios that potentially limit our future indebtedness the terms of the notes do not do so if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from international operations growing to 380 of overall revenues in 2018 as compared to 342 in 2017 revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be effective 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

actions of activist stockholders could be distracting to us cause us to incur significant expenses and impact the trading value of our common stock 

responding to actions by activist stockholders could be distracting to our board of directors our executives and our other employees such activities may also require us to incur significant legal and other advisor fees and public relations costs perceived uncertainty as to our future direction could affect customer and investor sentiment resulting in longer sales cycles employee retention and hiring challenges and volatility in the price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

litigation may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability breach of contract employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings in addition under our charter we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 

furthermore because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance there can be no assurance that the results of any litigation matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

facilities transitions could be disruptive to our operations and may result in unanticipated expense and adverse effects to our cash position and cash flows 

we plan to move into our new headquarters building in cambridge massachusetts in late 2019 this location represents our largest office in terms of square footage and employee headcount relocating our operations may be costly and could be disruptive and adversely affect productivity in the short term we could also face unanticipated expenses associated with the transition that could adversely impact our cash position and cash flows 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenue additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a deceleration in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other solutions could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses 

global climate change and natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development our customers investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

because we currently do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide solutions for delivering optimizing and securing content and business applications over the internet the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our performance and security offerings increase media traffic on our network develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses 

revenue 

for most of our solutions our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue in addition to a base level of revenue we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our solutions is more variable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of gaming social media and video platform offerings the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business the ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our solutions are also key factors impacting our revenue growth 

we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

 

 

 

 

 

expenses 

our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

 

 

 

 

 

we retrospectively adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition on january 1 2018 accordingly prior period results have been revised for the adoption of the new standard the changes to our revenue recognition approach under this new standard primarily impact the timing of recognizing revenue from a small number of licensed software customers there is little impact to revenue from our core web and media solutions as a result of the change we also began capitalizing certain commission and incentive payments the revisions as a result of adopting the new standard did not have a material impact on our annual revenue or results of operations but did cause quarteroverquarter fluctuations 

we report our revenue by division which is a customerfocused reporting view that reflects revenue from customers that are managed by the division as of january 1 2018 we now report our revenue in two divisions compared to the three divisions reported in 2017 the media division and enterprise and carrier division were combined to form the new media and carrier division as the purchasing patterns and required account expertise of customers change over time we may reassign a customer from one division to another in 2018 we reassigned some of our customers from the media and carrier division to the web division and revised historical results in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of higher media traffic volumes increased sales of our new product offerings and continued strong growth in our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 was 6579 million compared to 4855 million for the year ended december 31 2017 which represents a 355 increase the increase in our revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily the result of continued strong growth from our cloud security solutions and from new product introductions overall however the revenue growth rates for 2017 were negatively impacted by the doityourself efforts of our internet platform customers cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 was 4855 million compared to 3690 million for the year ended december 31 2016 which represents a 316 increase 

the increase in web division revenue for 2018  as compared to 2017  was due to increased purchases of new solutions and upgrades to existing services by this customer base increased sales of our cloud security solutions to web division customers in particular our kona site defender and prolexic solutions as well as our new bot manager offering were a principal contributor to our overall revenue growth the increase in web division revenue in 2017  as compared to 2016  was due to increased demand across most of our customer base particularly for our cloud security solutions 

the increase in media and carrier division revenue for 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily the result of increased customer traffic volumes from video delivery and gaming customers and sales of cloud security solutions to this customer base the increase in media and carrier division revenue was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our internet platform customers to 1748 million in 2018 as compared to 2033 million in 2017 excluding these customers revenue increased within the media and carrier division by 117 for 2018 as compared to 2017 the decrease in media and carrier division revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily the result of decreased traffic from our internet platform customers excluding these customers revenue increased within the media and carrier division by 26 for 2017 as compared to 2016 

revenue derived in the us and internationally during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the reduced revenue from our internet platform customers negatively impacted our us revenue growth rates for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  as these customers are based in the us for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 38  of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us compared to 34  for the year ended december 31 2017  and 31 for the year ended december 31 2016  no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods 

during 2018  and 2017  we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asiapacific region changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by 112 million  in 2018  as compared to 2017  and negatively impacted our revenue by 04 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily due to increases in 

 

these increases were partially offset by decreases in our bandwidth and colocation fees as we have been able to more effectively manage our network and reduce our costs 

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to increases in 

 

we have longterm purchase commitments for colocation services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network and internet service providers our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding our bandwidth usage and colocation services purchase commitments 

during 2019 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins including continuing to manage our bandwidth and colocation costs we do anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs will increase in 2019 as we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers however these costs are not expected to increase as a percentage of revenue we also expect to change the estimated useful lives of our network servers from four years to five years due to software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently we expect the useful lives our of network assets to be extended this change is expected to decrease depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2019 as compared to 2018 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2018  as compared to 2017  and 2017  as compared to 2016  were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth in 2017 to support investments in new product development and network scaling and as a result of employees acquired through acquisitions these increases were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internaluse software deployed on our network 

stockbased compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016 increased due to increased headcount and market adjustments of award sizes to existing employees due to competition for certain engineering talent 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31   2018 2017 and 2016  we capitalized 319 million  268 million  and 214 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years but can be up to seven years based on the software developed and its expected useful life 

we expect research and development costs to increase in 2019 as we maintain our focus on innovation however we do not expect these costs to increase as a percentage of revenue 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2018  as compared to 2017  and 2017 as compared to 2016 were primarily due to growth in payroll and related costs from headcount increases in 2017 to support our divisions gotomarket strategies in pursuit of growth opportunities our marketing programs and related costs in 2017 as compared to 2016 also increased in support of our gotomarket strategies and ongoing geographic expansion 

during 2019 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins while we continue to refine and optimize our gotomarket efforts 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  



the increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily due to increases in 

 

these increases were partially offset by a decrease to acquisitionrelated costs due to the release of an indemnification receivable in 2017 related to a prior acquisition and a decrease to payroll and related costs as a result of our efficiency efforts 

the increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to increases in 

 

general and administrative expenses for 2018  and 2017  are broken out by category as follows in thousands 



global functions expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for administrative functions including finance purchasing order entry human resources legal information technology and executive personnel as well as thirdparty professional service fees infrastructure expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for our network infrastructure functions as well as facility rent expense depreciation and amortization of facility and itrelated assets software and softwarerelated costs business insurance and taxes our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning sourcing architecture evaluation and platform security other expense includes acquisitionrelated costs provision for doubtful accounts legal settlements nonroutine stockholder matter costs the endowment of the akamai foundation transformation costs and the license of a patent 

the increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to 2017 was the result of a onetime endowment to the akamai foundation costs related to the settlement of litigation with limelight and amounts paid to professional service providers for advisory services in connection with a nonroutine stockholder matter 

the increase in infrastructure general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization due to expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2016 and 2017 to support investments in engineering gotomarket capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives particularly expansion of our facility footprint the increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the release of an indemnification receivable related to a prior acquisition 

during 2019 we plan to continue to focus our efforts on expanding our operating margins and in particular assessing areas of thirdparty spending and the automation of manual tasks 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2018  as compared to 2017  and 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of amortization of assets related to our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions 

based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31 2018  future amortization is expected to be approximately 366 million  339 million  280 million  224 million  and 171 million  for the years ending december 31 2019  2020  2021  2022  and 2023  respectively 

restructuring charge 



the restructuring charge in 2018 was primarily the result of management actions intended to rebalance investments to ensure longterm growth and scale the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount reductions and software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be implemented due to this action 

the restructuring charge in 2017 was primarily the result of management actions intended to shift focus to more critical areas of the business and away from products that have not seen expected commercial success the restructuring was also intended to facilitate cost efficiencies and savings the restructuring charge relates to certain headcount and facility reductions and certain capitalized internaluse software charges for software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and implemented due to this action 

the restructuring charge in 2016 was primarily the result of changes to our organizational structure to reorganize and consolidate our products and development groups and global sales services and marketing teams into divisions centered on our solutions the restructuring charge relates to severance expenses for impacted employees and charges for internaluse software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to changing priorities as part of the reorganization 

in addition to the actions described above we have also recognized restructuring charges for redundant employees facilities and contracts associated with completed acquisitions in each of the three years presented 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of up to 120 million in 2019 as a result of the action committed to in the fourth quarter of 2018 these charges will include severance and related expenses for terminations in the first quarter of 2019 

nonoperating income expense 



for the periods presented interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities the increase to interest income in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily the result of increased cash cash 

equivalents and marketable securities balances as a result of our may 2018 issuance of 11500 million in par value of 

convertible senior notes due 2025 

interest expense is related to our debt transactions which are described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the increase to interest expense for 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the may 2018 issuance of 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 which bear regular interest of 0125 but have an effective interest rate of 426 due to the conversion feature 

other expense income net for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions other expense income net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events other expense income net also includes gains and losses from certain equity investments 

provision for income taxes 



for the year ended december 31 2018 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to foreign income taxed at lower rates the effects of stockbased compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for sharebased payments a decrease in the provisional amount of the onetime transition tax that was recorded in 2017 the release of certain tax reserves related to the expiration of local statutes and the benefit of us federal state and foreign research and development credits these benefits were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us the remeasurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization due to the us tax cuts and jobs act or tcja which was enacted in december 2017 the impacts of the release of the acquisitionrelated reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and us federal state and foreign research and development credits these benefits were partially offset by a provisional charge for the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings taken as part of the tcja the effects of stockbased compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2017 the net impact of the tcja described above was a provisional net tax expense of 260 million which is comprised of a onetime transition tax expense of 434 million on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 offset by a 174 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower corporate income tax rate as of december 31 2018 we have finalized the 

accounting for all of the tax effects of the tcja and recorded a reduction of the transition tax expense of 55 million and an increase to the tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of 24 million 

for the year ended december 31 2016 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us the domestic production activities deduction and us federal state and foreign research and development credits partially offset by the effects of stockbased compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 as compared to 2017 was mainly due to the reduction in the us federal statutory tax rate from 350 to 210 as part of the tcja that was enacted in december 2017 an increase in the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and the net impact of the tcja recorded in 2017 these amounts were partially offset by an intercompany sale of intellectual property and an increase in nondeductible executive compensation 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in profit before tax the remeasurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization as a result of the tcja the impacts of the release of an acquisitionrelated reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and an increase in us federal state and foreign research and development credits these benefits were partially offset by a decrease in the domestic production activities deduction and a provisional charge for the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as a result of the tcja 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards tax law changes and settlements of tax audits and assessments our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate in the next 12 months and for the potential impact that current litigation related to an adverse audit finding could have on our results of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decisionmaking for planning and forecasting purposes to set executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that facilitates meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they assist in the comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income per diluted share to nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  shares in thousands 



1 may not foot due to rounding 

nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fullydiluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than 8956 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2019 and unless or until our weighted average stock price is greater than 9510 the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes due 2025 there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business gains and losses on legal settlements costs incurred with respect to our internal fcpa investigation foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt amortization of debt discount and issuance costs amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken generally our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2018  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of commercial paper and corporate bonds totaled 21 billion  factoring in our convertible senior notes of 18 billion our net cash at december 31 2018  was 2612 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as accounts receivable deferred revenues accounts payable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business 

as of december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 3517 million  held in accounts outside the us as a result of the tcja we have recorded a tax expense of 394 million related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2018  we made an election to pay the transition tax in installments over an eightyear period we have sufficient cash in the us to pay this tax obligation and do not need to rely on cash outside the us for payment the tcja also provides for a territorial tax system in the us which may provide companies with the ability to repatriate earnings with minimal us federal income tax impact as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us for additional information including information on the impact of the tcja see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily due to increased profitability in 2018 lower cash paid for income taxes due to a lower us federal statutory tax rate due to the tcja during 2018  and the timing of collections and payments of other working capital items the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the 2018  as compared to 2017  was partially offset by a onetime contribution to the akamai foundation of 500 million as well as higher annual bonus payouts in the first quarter of 2018 due to increased headcount from hiring in 2017 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to lower profitability as a result of the restructuring charge in 2017 and higher expenses as a result of our 2017 acquisitions payroll and related costs including annual bonus and commissions payouts were higher in 2017  as compared to 2016  due to increased headcount and higher bonus and commission attainment levels 

cash used in investing activities 



the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018  as compared to 2017  was driven by marketable securities activities in 2017 we did not reinvest all proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities which created a cash inflow in that year the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018  as compared to 2017  was partially offset by the cash paid in 2017 for the acquisitions of nominum inc and soasta inc 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017  as compared to 2016  was driven by a decrease in marketable securities activities this was offset by the funding our 2017  acquisitions of nominum and soasta we also increased our purchases of property and equipment in 2017  as compared to 2016  to support both network and facility expansion 

subsequent to december 31 2018 we acquired janrain inc a provider of customer identity access management solutions for 1250 million the allcash transaction closed in january 2019 

cash provided by used in financing activities 



the increase in cash provided by financing activities during 2018  as compared to 2017  was the result of our convertible senior notes issued in may 2018 and related note hedge and warrant transactions the increase was partially offset by an increase in shares repurchased under our repurchase programs 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to an increase in employee taxes paid related to net share settlement of stockbased awards 

in october 2013 the board of directors authorized a 7500 million  share repurchase program effective from october 2013 through december 2016 in february 2016 the board of directors authorized a 10 billion  share repurchase program that superseded the october 2013 repurchase program and was effective from february 2016 through december 2018 in march 2018 the company announced that its board of directors had increased its share repurchase authorization by 4167 million  such that the amount that was authorized and available for repurchase in 2018 was 7500 million  subsequently effective november 2018 the board of directors authorized an additional 11 billion repurchase program through december 2021 our goal for the share repurchase programs are to offset the dilution created by its employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant 

during 2018  2017  and 2016  we repurchased 102 million  69 million  and 70 million  shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 7354  5259  and 5328  respectively these repurchases have contributed to a decrease to weighted average shares over at least the past three years 

convertible senior notes 

in may 2018 we issued 11500 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2025 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity all of our 6900 million outstanding aggregate principle amount of convertible senior notes due in 2019 in addition we intend to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the notes were classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 we repaid the full 6900 million in cash in february 2019 as the notes matured and no conversions occurred 

revolving credit facility 

in may 2018 we entered into a 5000 million fiveyear revolving credit agreement or the credit agreement borrowings under the facility may be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes the facility provides for an initial 5000 million in revolving loans under specified circumstances the facility can be increased to up to 10 billion in aggregate principal amount 

borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a base rate plus a spread of 000 to 025 or an adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 0875 to 125 in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement regardless of what amounts if any are outstanding under the credit agreement we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0075 to 015 with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio specified in the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default principal covenants include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of december 31 2018  

liquidity outlook 

based on our present business plan we expect our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations to be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our expected capital expenditures investments in information technology and facility expansion opportunistic business acquisitions anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2018  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  678 million  including  118 million  of accrued interest and penalties we believe that it is 

reasonably possible that 332 million  of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2019 the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding 78 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until 2026  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2018  and 2017  was determined to be immaterial 

legal matters 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business we do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers sometimes include promises to transfer multiple services to a customer determining whether services are distinct performance obligations often requires the exercise of judgment by management advanced features that enhance a main product or service and are highly interrelated are generally not considered distinct rather they are combined with the service they relate to into one performance obligation different determinations related to combining services into performance obligations could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

determination of the standalone selling price or ssp also requires the exercise of judgment by management ssp is based on observable inputs such as the price we charge for the service when sold separately or the discounted list price per management’s approved price list in cases where services are not sold separately or price list rates are not available a costplusmargin approach or adjusted market approach is used to determine ssp changes to ssp could result in differences in the allocation of transaction price among performance obligations which could result in differences in the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a period 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell services or license technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time that we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises consideration payable to a customer is reviewed as part of the transaction price if the payment to the customer does not represent payment for a distinct service revenue is recognized only up to the net amount of consideration after customer payment obligations are considered different determinations on whether a payment represents a distinct service could result in differences in the amount of revenue recognized 

we may also resell the licenses or services of third parties if we are acting as an agent in an arrangement with a customer to provide third party services the transaction price reflects only the net amount to which we will be entitled after accounting for payments made to the third party responsible for satisfying the performance obligation different determinations on whether we are acting as an agent or a principal could change the amount of revenue recognized 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves primarily consist of allowances for doubtful accounts increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

estimates are used in determining our reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and 

extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2018 and 2017  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained based on technical 

merit the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of marketbased restricted stock unit awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds and money market funds the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of income within other expense income net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and operating expenses conversely our revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2018 and 2017  no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2018  the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2018  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15 e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2018  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f promulgated under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

 

to assist management we have established an internal audit function to verify and monitor our internal controls and procedures because of its inherent limitations however internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control — integrated framework 2013  

based on our assessment management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2018  our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level 

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

sales service and marketing 

we market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and service organization and through many channel partners including att deutsche telecom ibm orange business services and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers referral partners and sales agents by aligning with these partners we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

our sales service and marketing professionals are based in locations across the americas europe the middle east and asia and focus on direct and channel sales sales operations professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2017  we had 3594  employees in this organization 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows strategic alliances ongoing customer communication programs training and sales support 

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2017  we owned or had exclusive rights to more than 330 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2018 and 2036 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had 7650  fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work 

additional information 

akamai was incorporated in delaware in 1998 and we have our corporate headquarters at 150 broadway cambridge massachusetts our internet website address is wwwakamaicom we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments thereto that we have filed or furnished with the securities and exchange commission or the commission as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission we are not however including the information contained on our website or information that may be accessed through links on our website as part of or incorporating such information by reference into this annual report on form 10k 




 item 1a    risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

if we do not continue to innovate make sound investments that bring positive returns and develop profitable products and solutions that are attractive to existing and potential customers our operating results may suffer 

we have been in business for nearly two decades and consider ourselves pioneers in the development of content and application delivery and security solutions as the information technology industry evolves however it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage in business areas where we have historically placed our focus in particular our traditional offerings particularly our media and website delivery services could face more intense competition as competitors or even current or former customers seek to replicate them such that we must lower the prices we charge reducing the profitability of such offerings or risk losing such business 

it is therefore also important to our revenue growth and profitability that we enter into new business areas that present significant valuegenerating investment opportunities this requires investing in business areas that can potentially provide positive returns and developing or acquiring innovative highmargin solutions including in areas such as enterprise security and digital performance management we must do so in a rapidlychanging technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers where competitors may develop products and services that are or may be viewed as better than ours and where it can be costly to acquire other companies the process of developing new solutions is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept and we may choose to invest in business areas for which a viable market for our products does not ultimately develop this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue there is often a lengthy period between commencing development initiatives and bringing new or improved solutions to market during this time technology preferences customer demand and the market for our solutions or those introduced by our competitors may move in directions that we had not anticipated when we decided to pursue such initiatives furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning timing or execution technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources 

failure to invest in areas that can potentially provide a positive return or to adequately develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us and inability to keep pace with rapid technological and market changes could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

slower traffic growth on our network and numerous other factors could cause our revenue growth rate to slow and profitability to decline 

during the past twenty years we have diversified our business from a mediadominated cdn by becoming a leading supplier of web and security products and services for a broad range of customers in myriad industries nevertheless increasing traffic on our network remains key to our revenue growth and profitability numerous factors can impact traffic growth including 



 

we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth in addition many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early if we experience slower traffic growth on our network than we expect or than we have experienced in recent years our revenue growth rate will slow and we may not be able to maintain our current level of profitability in 2018 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

our profitability may also decline in future periods as a result of a number of other factors unrelated to traffic growth including 

 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product and service offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are excellence of technology global presence customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength competitors include some of our current partners and customers 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases broader product portfolios longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 • adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly 

• take advantage of acquisition investment and other opportunities more readily 

 • dedicate greater resources to the research and development of their products and services 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 • develop new business models that are disruptive to us and 

 

existing and potential customers may not purchase our services or may limit their use of them because they 

 • enter into relationships directly with network providers instead of relying on an overlay network like ours or 

• implement multivendor policies to reduce reliance on external providers like us 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations renewals at lower rates or other less favorable terms 

it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers sellng more highmargin services features and functionalities to existing customers and increasing traffic usage by all customers some customers may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths historically a significant percentage of our renewals particularly with larger customers has led to unit price declines as competition has increased and the market for certain parts of our business has matured our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors including competitive pressures customer dissatisfaction with our services customers inability to continue their operations and spending levels the impact of multivendor policies customers implementing or increasing their use of inhouse technology solutions and general economic conditions in addition our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would negatively impact revenue 

security breaches and attacks on our platform could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet we transmit and store our customers information data and encryption keys as well as our own customer information and data may in turn include individual data of and about their customers maintaining the security and availability of our services network and internal it systems and the security of information we hold is a critical issue for us and our customers attacks on our customers and our own network are frequent and take a variety of forms including ddos attacks infrastructure attacks botnets malicious file uploads crosssite scripting credential abuse ransomware bugs viruses worms and malicious software programs malicious actors can attempt to fraudulently induce employees or suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactics in addition unauthorized parties may attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems 

in recent years internetbased attacks have increased in size sophistication and complexity increasing exposure for our customers and us in addition as we expand our emphasis on selling securityrelated solutions we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure intended to destabilize overwhelm or shut down our platform the costs to us to avoid or alleviate cyber or other security problems and vulnerabilities are significant however our efforts to address these problems may not be successful any significant breach of our security measures could 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation lead to customer credits loss of customers higher expenses and possibly impede our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers a successful assault on our infrastructure would be damaging to our reputation and could adversely affect our financial condition 

similar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the thirdparty vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions as a result we are subject to the risk that the activities of our business partners and thirdparty vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly impact our systems 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in disruptions to our services and loss of revenue 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers particularly those under cyberattack the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business natural disasters networks imposing traffic limits or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations in some regions network providers may choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices this risk is heightened where market power is concentrated with one or a few major networks we also may be unable to move quickly enough to augment capacity to reflect growing traffic or security demands failure to put in place the capacity we require could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition as we complete acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete are constantly evolving which makes our future business strategies practices and results difficult to predict 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete have grown significantly over the life of our company and continue to evolve rapidly in response to new technological advances changing business models and other factors we and the other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to 

 

the internet itself is constantly evolving there could develop an inflection point above which global usage of the internet increases to a level that causes our current approaches to the delivery of content and applications to no longer be sustainable at current levels of profitability or at all we also need to continue to manage successfully the transition from the ipv4 protocol to ipv6 

with this constantly changing environment our future business strategies practices and results may be difficult to predict and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes any of these developments could harm our business 

our operating results can be impacted by the actions and business life cycles of a small number of large customers 

historically our operating results have been subject to fluctuations due to our dependence on several large customers particularly media companies for a significant portion of our revenues the amount of traffic we deliver on behalf of those customers can vary significantly based on decisions they make about their businesses including whether to start or delay new business initiatives build out their own networks to handle delivery or implement or maintain multiple vendor strategies these approaches can change rapidly and unpredictably while we believe that we will be less reliant on individual customers in the future we are likely to continue to face some uncertainty in forecasting our revenues as they relate to these customers from quarter to quarter or over longer periods we could also experience inconsistent revenue growth patterns and earnings as a result of the behavior of these customers 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful in these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our it and operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures as a result these systems could generate errors that impact traffic measurement or invoicing we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems traffic measurement systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business 

over the past several years we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations improve operational efficiencies enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business disruptions in operations may occur as a result of taking these actions taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us including with respect to workforce reductions as well as decreased productivity and unanticipated employee turnover substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones in making employment decisions particularly in our industry job candidates and current personnel often 

consider the value of stockbased compensation in recent years we have increasingly linked compensation levels to corporate performance metrics declines in the price of our stock or failure to achieve annual revenue and profitability metrics could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees 

none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations and detrimental to our future outlook the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our services beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our services in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a minimum revenue commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would create additional challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

actions of activist stockholders could be distracting to us cause us to incur significant expenses and impact the trading value of our common stock 

  

responding to actions by activist stockholders could be distracting to our board of directors executives and our other employees such activities may also require us to incur significant legal and other advisor fees and public relations costs perceived uncertainty as to our future direction could affect customer and investor sentiment resulting in longer sales cycles employee retention and hiring challenges and volatility in the price of our common stock 

we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our operations internationally as a result we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

geopolitical events such as the united kingdoms pending withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as brexit may increase the likelihood of certain of these risks materializing or heighten their impact on us in affected regions in particular it is possible that the level of economic activity in the united kingdom and the rest of europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities including those related to tax trade security and employee relations as a result of brexit such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in affected regions 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others 

 

we entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the commission in june 2016 in connection with the previouslydisclosed investigation relating to sales practices in a country outside the us in the event we violate the terms of this nonprosecution agreement we could be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the commission or the department of justice although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the nonprosecution agreement and relevant laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws any such violations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries they could also materially affect our brand our global operations any international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business overall and our financial results 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our services and platform that have given rise to service incidents or otherwise impacted our operations we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future while we have robust quality control processes in the place there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our services or systems or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services or systems we could experience loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and legal actions by our customers 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could negatively impact our business it is unclear whether potential changes to regulations previously adopted by the us federal communications commission that govern certain aspects of the operation of the internet such as content blocking and throttling and paid prioritization will be adopted and if adopted how they would apply to content delivery network providers like us it is also uncertain how future regulatory and legislative initiatives or changes will impact our business 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could expose us to increased liability 

privacy laws including the european union general data protection regulation or gdpr are rapidly changing and evolving globally governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data new laws and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that like the gdpr may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our products and services are being used and to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and how we use data generated from our network any perception that our business practices data collection activities or how our services operate represent an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism or boycotts class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability compliance with gdpr may be administratively difficult and expensive 

over the past several years the regulatory landscape governing the transfer of covered personal data from europe to the united states has seen sweeping changes currently we have in place useuropean union and us swiss privacy shield frameworks to legally transfer covered personal data from europe to the united states but their legitimacy may continue to be subject to challenge and review any changing or new requirements or rulings by the european commission or eu member jurisdictions may impact our services or subject us to sanctions including fines and a prohibition on data transfers by eu data protection regulators furthermore any continued or new judicial challenges or reviews may result in new modified or inconsistent standards or requirements for the transfer of personal data which could result in increased regulation cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers these developments could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning our collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims including those that may arise under international laws in many cases we have agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our services infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our services or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or channel or strategic partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable however certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost furthermore opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business 

we may be unsuccessful at developing and maintaining strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenue which could significantly limit our longterm growth 

achieving future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators product makers and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenue if we become reliant on a small number of large partners any termination of our relationship with one of them could have an adverse impact on our financial condition the need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the us we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services and ensuring that they are compliant with our ethical expectations requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channels those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our 

estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation in particular we do not yet know the full effect that the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and subsequent related regulations will have on our business and tax exposure assessment we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts if the outcome of such audit or other audits were to be adverse to us our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of december 31 2017  we had total par value of 6900 million of convertible senior notes outstanding due in 2019 our ability to refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business in addition the terms of the notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from international operations revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated 

us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be effective 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

litigation may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings in addition under our charter we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 

we are currently involved in litigation with one of our competitors limelight networks inc or limelight involving claims for patent infringement limelight has asserted that it is entitled to significant damages while we challenge the basis of the underlying claims and amount of such assertions if such action were to be decided against our favor and a court were to award limelight significant damages our business and financial condition would be adversely impacted 

furthermore because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance there can be no assurance that the results of the limelight litigation or any of these other matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenue additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a deceleration in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses 

global climate change and natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources while we have invested in projects to support renewable energy development our customers investors and other stakeholders may require us to take more steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

because we currently do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 • our board of directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

against limelight alleging that limelight has infringed akamai content delivery patents and we are seeking monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to the infringing technology used by limelight a trial date on limelights patents has been set for april 2018 we currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide cloud services for delivering optimizing and securing content and business applications over the internet the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our performance and security offerings increase media traffic on our network develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses 

revenue 

for most of our solutions our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue in addition to a base level of revenue we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our services is more variable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of social media and video platform capabilities the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business the ability to expand our product portfolio and to effectively manage the prices we charge for our services are also key factors impacting our revenue growth 

we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

 

 

 

 



expenses 

our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

 

 

 

 

 

in recent years we have used strategic acquisitions to complement and augment existing technological capabilities during each of 2017  2016  and 2015  we completed various acquisitions that while immaterial to our financial results as a whole during those years have contributed to increases in our revenue and level of expenses 

  

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue from 2016  to 2017  was primarily the result of continued strong growth from our cloud security solutions which grew 32 yearoveryear and from new product introductions overall however the revenue growth rates for 2017  and 2016  have been negatively impacted by the doityourself efforts of our internet platform customers some of which have developed internal infrastructure to deliver more of their media content themselves rather than rely on our media services revenue from these six customers in the aggregate declined from 2505 million in 2016 to 2029 million in 2017 

  

the increase in our revenue from 2015  to 2016  was driven by higher demand for our services across all of our solutions and geographies with particularly strong growth from our cloud security solutions the impact of the revenue decline from our internet platform customers was particularly acute in 2016 declining to 2505 million as compared to 3793 million in 2015 

we expect our revenue to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a result of increased customer traffic delivered on our network sales of incremental services to our existing customers and sales to new customers 

the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from our divisions in thousands it is a customerfocused reporting view that reflects revenue we received from customers that are managed by the indicated division for example media division revenue represents all revenue received from customers that are predominately purchasing solutions from our media verticals ott video services gaming social media etc including revenue from nonmedia solutions that those customers purchase during 2017 the divisional categorization of certain customers was adjusted based on how those customer relationships were being managed the historical presentation of divisional revenue was revised in order to reflect the most recent categorization and to provide a comparable view for all periods presented during 2018 we plan to consolidate and manage our customers in two divisions the web division and the media and carrier division 



the increase in web division revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  was due to increased purchases of new solutions and upgrades to existing services by this customer base increased sales of our cloud security solutions to web division customers in particular our kona site defender and prolexic solutions as well as our new bot manager offering were a principal contributor to our overall revenue growth the increase in web division revenue in 2016  as compared to 2015  was due to increased demand across most of our customer base particularly for our cloud security solutions 

the declines in the yearoveryear revenue growth rate in media division revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  and 2016  as compared to 2015  were primarily the result of decreased traffic from our internet platform customers the yearoveryear revenue growth rate for other media division customers was 4 and 14 for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from our solution categories which is a productfocused view that reflects revenue by solution purchased in thousands 



the increases in performance and security solutions revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  and 2016  as compared to 2015  were due to new product introductions and increased demand across all major product lines with especially strong growth in our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  was 4815 million  as compared to 3649 million  and 2544 million  for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively 

the declines in media delivery solutions revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  and 2016  as compared to 2015  were primarily the result of decreased traffic from our internet platform customers resulting from their doityourself efforts in delivering their content during 2017 as compared to 2016 revenue from our media delivery solutions for other customers remained flat 

the increases in services and support solutions revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  and 2016  as compared to 2015  were due to strong attachment rates for our professional services for new customers as well as purchases of upgrades to professional services by our existing customers 

the following table quantifies revenue derived in the us and internationally in thousands 



the reduced revenue from our internet platform customers negatively impacted our us revenue growth rates for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016 as these customers are based in the us for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 34  of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us compared to 31  for the year ended december 31 2016  and 27 for the year ended december 31 2015  no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods 

during 2017  and 2016 we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asia pacific region changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by 04 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  and by 10 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to increases in 

 

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to increases in 

 

we have longterm purchase commitments for colocation services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network and internet service providers our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding our bandwidth usage and colocation services purchase commitments 

we believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2018  as compared to 2017  due to higher bandwidth expenses associated with increased customer traffic on our network and the costs we expect to incur to increase our networks capacity and resiliency with the goal of combating potential attacks on our platform additionally during 2018  we anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs to increase as compared to 2017  along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our professional services personnel and related expenses however we do not anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as a percentage of revenue during 2018 as compared to 2017 we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2017  as compared to 2016  and 2016 as compared to 2015 were due to increases in 

 

the increases in research and development expenses for the periods presented above were partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs due to continued investment in internaluse software deployed on our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31   2017 2016 and 2015  we capitalized 268 million  214 million  and 167 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years 

we believe that research and development expenses during 2018  will increase as compared to 2017  as a result of the increases in headcount we experienced throughout 2017 we expect the increases to payroll and related costs in 2018 as compared to 2017 to be at a slower pace than we experienced in 2017 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to increases in 

 

the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to a decrease in performancebased commissions earned and reduced spending on marketing programs and related costs as we moderated discretionary spending to align with our revenue growth rates 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase during 2018  as compared to 2017  due to increased payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth during 2017  and expected hiring in 2018 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  



the increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in 

 

the increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in 

 capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives particularly expansion of our facility footprint which 

increased facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization and 

 performancebased stockbased compensation awards from period to period 

general and administrative expenses for 2017 and 2016 are broken out by category as follows in thousands 



global functions expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for administrative functions including finance purchasing order entry human resources legal information technology and executive personnel as well as thirdparty professional service fees infrastructure expense includes payroll stockbased compensation and other employeerelated costs for our network infrastructure functions as well as facility rent expense depreciation and amortization of facility and itrelated assets software and softwarerelated costs business insurance and taxes our network infrastructure function is responsible for network planning sourcing architecture evaluation and platform security other expenses includes acquisitionrelated costs provision for doubtful accounts and the license of a patent  

during 2018  we expect payroll and related costs of our general and administrative functions to increase as compared to 2017  as a result of headcount growth in 2017 we do not expect other areas of general and administrative expenses to experience the same level of increases as past years and we expect acquisitionrelated costs to decrease as a result of the release of an indemnification receivable in 2017 that will not recur in 2018 that related to a prior acquisition 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2017  as compared to 2016  was the result of amortization of assets related to our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2016  as compared to 2015  was attributable to the finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years partially offset by intangible assets we acquired in 2015 and 2016 

based on acquired intangible assets as of december 31 2017  future amortization is expected to be approximately 333 million  365 million  338 million  279 million  and 224 million  for the years ending december 31 2018  2019  2020  2021  and 2022  respectively 

restructuring charges 



the increase in restructuring charges in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of certain restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 management committed to an action to restructure certain parts of the business primarily mediarelated with the intent of shifting focus to more critical areas and away from products that have not seen expected commercial success the restructuring is also intended to facilitate other cost efficiencies and savings certain capitalized internaluse software charges have been realized for software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to this action in addition as part of cost efficiencies and savings certain headcount and facility reductions were made the restructuring charges in 2017  also consisted of severance expenses associated with the acquisitions of soasta and nominum 

the restructuring charges in 2016  were primarily the result of changes to our organizational structure to reorganize and consolidate our products and development groups and global sales services and marketing teams into divisions centered on our solutions the restructuring charges relate to severance expenses for impacted employees and charges for internaluse software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to changing priorities as part of the reorganization 

the restructuring charges in 2015  consisted of severance expenses for redundant employees associated with acquisitions completed during those years 

we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of up to 150 million in 2018 as a result of the action committed to in the fourth quarter of 2017 and continued in the first quarter of 2018 these charges will include severance and related expenses for terminations of approximately 300 employees in the first quarter of 2018 and charges related to facility closures we plan to implement in 2018 

nonoperating income expense 



for the periods presented interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest expense consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 

other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions the fluctuation in other income expense net for 2016 as compared to 2015  also includes the impact of gains recognized on the disposition of certain cost method investments other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events 

provision for income taxes 



for the year ended december 31 2017  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us the remeasurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization due to the us tax cuts and jobs act or tcja which was enacted in december 2017 the impacts of the release of an acquisitionrelated reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and us federal state and foreign research and development credits these benefits were partially offset by a provisional charge for the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings taken as part of the tcja the effects of stockbased compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2017 the net impact of the tcja described above was a provisional net tax expense of 260 million  which is comprised of a onetime transition tax expense of 434 million  on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 offset by a 174 million  tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the lower corporate income tax rate 

for the year ended december 31 2016 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us the domestic production activities deduction and us federal state and foreign research and development credits partially 

offset by the effects of stockbased compensation in accordance with authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2015 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation in intercompany arrangements us federal state and foreign research and development credits the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us these benefits were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2017 as compared to 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in profit before tax the remeasurement of deferred taxes at lower tax rates expected to be in place upon realization as a result of the tcja the impacts of the release of an acquisitionrelated reserve due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations and an increase in us federal state and foreign research and development credits these benefits were partially offset by a decrease in the domestic production activities deduction and a provisional charge for the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as a result of the tjca 

the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation on intercompany arrangements that occurred in 2015 a decrease in us federal and state research and development credits and a change in the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions this increase in the provision for income taxes was partially offset by an increase in the domestic production activities deduction 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decisionmaking for planning and forecasting purposes to set executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that facilitates meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they assist in the comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 



on the stock price at the time of grant varying valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation from our nongaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income per diluted share to nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  shares in thousands 



1 may not foot due to rounding 

nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fullydiluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than 8956 the initial conversion price there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business gains and losses on legal settlements costs incurred with respect to our internal fcpa investigation foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt amortization of debt discount and issuance costs amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken generally our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2017  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency securities totaled 13 billion  factoring in our convertible senior notes of 6900 million our net cash at december 31 2017  was 5895 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenues accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 2124 million  held in accounts outside the us as a result of the tcja we have recorded a provisional tax expense of 434 million related to the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017  the tcja also provides for a territorial tax system in the us which may provide companies with the ability to repatriate earnings with minimal us federal income tax impact beginning in 2018 we have sufficient cash in the us to pay this tax obligation and do not need to rely on cash outside the us for payment as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us for additional information including information on the impact of the tcja see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

cash provided by operating activities 



the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to lower profitability as a result of the restructuring charge in 2017 and increased level of expenses as a result of our 2017 acquisitions payroll and related costs including annual bonus and commissions payouts were higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to increased headcount and higher bonus and commission attainment levels 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to higher cash collection from customers due to increased revenue and lower commissions and annual bonus payments due to lower attainment levels these increases to cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by higher cash payments for taxes during 2016  as compared to 2015  

cash used in investing activities 



the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017  as compared to 2016  was driven by a decrease in marketable securities activity this was offset by the funding our 2017 acquisitions of nominum and soasta we also increased our purchases of property and equipment in 2017 as compared to 2016 to support both network and facility expansion 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2016  as compared to 2015  was driven by net marketable securities activity which was a net outflow for the year our excess cash as well as the proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities were reinvested as compared to 2015  where we did not reinvest a portion of our proceeds in order to fund acquisitions this outflow was partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment during 2016  as compared 2015  as we moderated investment in our network additionally acquisitions during 2016  were of a smaller magnitude than those during 2015  

cash used in financing activities 



the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to an increase in employee taxes paid related to net share settlement of stockbased awards the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily the result of increased share repurchases 

in october 2013 the board of directors authorized a 7500 million share repurchase program effective from october 16 2013 through december 31 2016 in february 2016 the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program that superseded the october 2013 repurchase program and became effective in february 2016 through december 31 2018 the companys goals for the share repurchase program are to offset the dilution created by its employee equity compensation programs and to provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant 

during 2017 2016 and 2015 we repurchased 69 million  70 million  and 45 million  shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 5259  5328  and 6705  respectively these repurchases have contributed to a decrease in weighted average shares over at least the past three years 

convertible senior notes 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we have used and intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

the convertible senior notes are due in february 2019 and are classified as a longterm liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 we are currently assessing our options with respect to repayment of the notes 

liquidity outlook 

we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our expected capital expenditures investments in information technology and facility expansion opportunistic business acquisitions anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2017  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2017  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  907 million  including  107 million  of accrued interest and penalties we believe that it is reasonably possible that 33 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2018 the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding 64 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until 2028  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2017  and 2016  was determined to be immaterial 

legal matters 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business we do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in november 2015 limelight filed a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia against akamai and xo communications llc or xo alleging patent infringement by the two companies the complaint seeks to recover from akamai and xo significant monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to infringing technology used by the companies we have agreed to indemnify xo for damages it incurs in this matter we have made counterclaims in the action against limelight alleging that limelight has infringed akamai content delivery patents and we are seeking monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to the infringing technology used by limelight a trial date on limelights patents has been set for april 2018 we currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our business 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenue from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for contracts with a monthly commitment we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the purchased services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services – the delivery of content applications and software over the internet – as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services these elements have value to our customers on a standalone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor generally there is no right of return relative to these services 

we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements all standalone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average standalone selling price for those services for our core services the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately 

for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe third party evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we estimate besp based upon a managementapproved price list and preestablished discount levels for each solution that take into consideration volume geography and industry lines we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2017 and 2016  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets 

and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our consolidated financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained based on technical merit the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

the tcja made significant changes to the us internal revenue code including a corporate income tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 the implementation of a modified territorial tax system a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 and the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction among other items the securities and exchange commission or the commission issued guidance for the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja that allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date 

we have recognized the provisional impacts related to the onetime transition tax and the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the ultimate impact could materially differ from the provisional amounts we have recorded due to additional analysis changes in assumptions or interpretations we have made additional guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the tcja for the onetime transition tax further information is required to finalize the estimated amount of accumulated foreign earnings as well as to validate the amount of earnings represented by the   aggregate foreign cash position as defined in the tcja for the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and   liabilities further analysis will be required to refine our calculations and related account balances we expect to complete the analysis within the measurement period and any subsequent adjustment to the provisional amounts will be recognized as a current tax provision or benefit in the quarter of 2018 in which the analysis is completed 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of marketbased restricted stock awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds and money market funds the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of income within other income expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and operating expenses conversely our revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2017 and 2016  no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2017  the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2016  we owned or had exclusive rights to more than 265 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2017 and 2034 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had 6490  fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work

 item 1a    risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

if we do not continue to innovate and develop solutions and technologies that are useful for our customers or that improve our operating efficiencies our operating results may suffer 

we have been in business for nearly two decades and consider ourselves pioneers in the development of content and application delivery solutions as the information technology industry evolves however it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage in particular our traditional offerings risk becoming commoditized as competitors or even current or former customers seek to replicate them such that we must lower the prices we charge reducing the profitability of such offerings or risk losing such business we believe therefore that developing or acquiring innovative highmargin solutions is key to our revenue growth and profitability we must do so in a rapidlychanging technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers where competitors may develop products and services that are or may be viewed as better than ours and where it can be costly to acquire other companies the process of developing new solutions is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue there is often a lengthy period between commencing development initiatives and bringing new or improved solutions to market during this time the technology preferences customer demand and market for our solutions or those introduced by our competitors may move in directions that we had not anticipated furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning timing or execution technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources failure to adequately develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and to keep pace with rapid technological and market changes could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

slower traffic growth on our network and numerous other factors could cause our revenue growth rate to slow and profitability to decline 

increasing traffic on our network is key to our revenue growth and profitability numerous factors can impact traffic growth including 

 

we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with colocation and bandwidth providers so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early if we experience slower traffic growth on our network than we expect or than we have experienced in recent years our revenue growth rate will slow and we may not be able to maintain our current level of profitability in 2017 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

our profitability may also decline in future periods as a result of a number of other factors unrelated to traffic growth including 

 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete are constantly evolving which makes our future business strategies practices and results difficult to predict 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete have grown significantly over the life of our company and continue to evolve rapidly in response to new technological advances changing business models and other factors we and the other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to 

 

the internet itself is constantly evolving there could develop an inflection point above which global usage of the internet increases to a level that causes our current approaches to the delivery of content and applications to no longer be sustainable at current levels of profitability or at all we also need to continue to manage successfully the transition from the ipv4 protocol to ipv6 

with this constantly changing environment our future business strategies practices and results may be difficult to predict and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes any of these developments could harm our business 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product and service offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are excellence of technology global presence customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength competitors include some of our current partners and customers 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 • adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly 

• take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily 

 • dedicate greater resources to the research and development of their products and services 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 • develop new business models that are disruptive to us and 

 

existing and potential customers may not purchase our services or may limit their use of them because they 

 • enter into relationships directly with network providers instead of relying on an overlay network like ours or 

• implement multivendor policies to reduce reliance on external providers like us 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations renewals at lower rates or other less favorable terms 

it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers and increasing the number of highmargin services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase we cannot predict our renewal rates some customers may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths historically a significant percentage of our renewals particularly with larger customers has led to unit price declines as competition has increased and the market for certain parts of our business has matured our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors including competitive pressures customer dissatisfaction with our services customers inability to continue their operations and spending levels the impact of multivendor policies customers implementing or increasing their use of inhouse technology solutions and general economic conditions in addition our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would negatively impact revenue 

security breaches and attacks on our platform could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet we transmit and store our customers information and data as well as our own maintaining the security and availability of our services network and internal it systems and the security of information we hold is a critical issue for us and our customers attacks on our customers and our own network take a variety of forms including distributed denial of service ddos attacks infrastructure attacks botnets malicious file uploads crosssite scripting credential abuse bugs viruses worms and malicious software programs malicious actors use attempts to fraudulently induce employees or suppliers to disclose sensitive information through illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactics in addition unauthorized parties may attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems 

in recent years internetbased attacks have increased in size sophistication and complexity increasing the exposure to our customers and us in addition as we expand our emphasis on selling securityrelated solutions we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure intended to destabilize overwhelm or shut down our platform the costs to us to avoid or alleviate cyber or other security problems and vulnerabilities are significant however our efforts to address these problems may not be successful any significant breach of our security measures could 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation lead to customer credits loss of customers higher expenses and possibly impede our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers a successful assault on our infrastructure would be damaging to our reputation and could adversely affect our financial condition 

similar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the thirdparty vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions as a result we are subject to the risk that the activities of our business partners and thirdparty vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in disruptions to our services and loss of revenue 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers particularly those under cyberattack the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business natural disasters networks imposing traffic limits or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations in some regions network providers may choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices this risk is heightened where market power is concentrated with one or a few major networks we also may be unable to move quickly enough to augment capacity to reflect growing traffic or security demands failure to put in place the capacity we require could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue in addition customers have increasingly elected to transmit their content over our ssl network which is more costly for us to operate and could require significant additional investment for us these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our profitability 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we expect to pursue acquisitions and other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we use a significant portion of our available cash to pay for acquisitions that are not successful it could harm our balance sheet and limit our flexibility to pursue other opportunities without having enjoyed the intended benefits of the acquisition as we complete acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

our operating results can be impacted by the actions and business life cycles of a small number of large customers 

historically our operating results have been subject to fluctuations due to our dependence on several large customers particularly media companies for a significant portion of our revenues the amount of traffic we deliver on behalf of those customers can vary significantly based on decisions they make about their businesses including whether to start or delay new business initiatives build out their own networks to handle delivery or implement or maintain multiple vendor strategies these approaches can change rapidly and unpredictably while we believe that we will be less reliant on individual customers in the future we are likely to continue to face some uncertainty in forecasting our revenues as they relate to these customers from quarter to quarter or over longer periods we could also experience inconsistent revenue growth patterns and earnings as a result of the behavior of these customers 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified personnel properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful in these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our it and operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to manage our technical support infrastructure effectively and improve our sales efficiency we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected if the third parties we rely on for hosted data solutions for our internal network and information systems are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services we utilize the integrity and availability of our internal information could be compromised causing the loss of confidential or proprietary information damage to our reputation and economic loss 

our restructuring and reorganization activities may be disruptive to our operations and harm our business 

over the past several years we have implemented internal restructurings and reorganizations designed to reduce the size and cost of our operations improve operational efficiencies enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives we may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies optimize our operations to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business disruptions in operations have occurred and will likely continue to occur including with respect to our research and development efforts as a result of taking these actions taking these actions may also result in significant expense for us including with respect to workforce reduction as well as decreased productivity and unanticipated employee turnover substantial expense or business disruptions resulting from restructuring and reorganization activities could adversely affect our operating results 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones in making employment decisions particularly in our industry job candidates and current personnel often consider the value of stockbased compensation declines in the price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees 

none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations and detrimental to our future outlook the loss of the services 

of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our services beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our services in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a minimum revenue commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would create additional challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

we face risks associated with global operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our operations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures which could harm our profitability we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

geopolitical events such as the united kingdoms vote in june 2016 to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit may increase the likelihood of certain of these risks materializing or heighten their impact on us in affected regions in particular it is possible that the level of economic activity in the united kingdom and the rest of europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities including those related to tax trade security and employees as a result of brexit such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in affected markets 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa the uk bribery act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations by our employees or partners could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our global operations any international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our financial statements although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws 

we entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the commission in june 2016 in connection with the previouslydisclosed investigation relating to sales practices in a country outside the us in the event we violate the terms of this non prosecution agreement we could be subject to additional investigation or enforcement by the commission or the department of justice in addition whether by virtue of disclosure of the nonprosecution agreement or otherwise we may be subject to investigations by foreign governments any such investigations or enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on us 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our services and platform that have given rise to service incidents we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our services or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and legal actions by our customers 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could negatively impact our business while regulations recently adopted by the us federal communications commission that govern certain aspects of the operation of the internet such as content blocking and throttling and paid prioritization do not apply to content delivery network providers like us there is no guarantee that future regulatory and legislative initiatives or changes including as a result of the election of the new us presidential administration will not impact our business in particular it is difficult to predict how the regulatory environment in the us will change as a result of the new presidential administration or whether any changes will have an adverse or favorable impact on our business 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could expose us to increased liability 

privacy laws including the new european union general data protection regulation are rapidly changing and evolving globally governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data new laws and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our products and services are being used to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and how we use data generated from our network any perception that our business practices data collection activities or how our services operate represent an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism or 

boycotts class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

in the past we have relied on the useuropean union and the usswiss safe harbor frameworks as agreed to by the us department of commerce and the european union and switzerland as a means to legally transfer covered personal data from europe to the united states however on october 6 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useuropean union safe harbor framework and swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the usswiss safe harbor framework as a result we have been establishing alternate legitimate means of transferring covered personal data from the european economic area to the united states including the new privacy shield framework the legitimacy of these alternate means are subject to ongoing judicial challenge and review in the european union any changing or new requirements or rulings by the european union or member jurisdictions may impact our services or subject us to sanctions including fines and a prohibition on data transfers by eu data protection regulators furthermore the european court of justice’s decision may result in different european data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data which could result in increased regulation cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers these developments could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning our collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from international operations revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be effective 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims including those that may arise under international laws in many cases we have agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our services infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our services or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or channel or strategic partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology we have licensed technology from the massachusetts institute of technology that is covered by various patents and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some 

of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights these patents are scheduled to expire beginning in 2018 as the patents expire we will no longer have the right to exclude others from practicing the technologies covered by them furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost 

we may be unsuccessful at developing and maintaining strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenue which could significantly limit our longterm growth 

our future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators product makers and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenue if we become reliant on a small number of large partners any termination of our relationship with one of them could have an adverse impact on our financial condition the need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the us we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services and ensuring that they are compliant with our ethical expectations requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channels those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including the commonwealth of massachusetts if the outcome of such audit or other audits were to be adverse to us our reserves may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of december 31 2016 we had total par value of 6900 million of convertible senior notes outstanding our ability to refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business in addition the terms of the notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we may become involved in litigation that may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings in addition under our charter we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 

we are currently involved in litigation with one of our competitors limelight networks inc or limelight involving claims for patent infringement limelight has asserted that it is entitled to significant damages while we challenge the basis of the underlying claims and amount of such assertions if such action were to be decided against our favor and a court were to award limelight significant damages our business and financial condition would be adversely impacted 

furthermore because litigation is inherently unpredictable and may not be covered by insurance there can be no assurance that the results of the limelight litigation or any of these other matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenue additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

global climate change and natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers investors and other stakeholders may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

because we do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 • our board of directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

all of our facilities are leased we believe our facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future and if needed additional space will be available at a reasonable cost 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business we do not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in november 2015 limelight filed a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia against akamai and xo communications llc or xo alleging patent infringement by the two companies the complaint alleges that akamai and xo infringed six of limelight’s content delivery patents the complaint seeks to recover from akamai and xo significant monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to infringing technology used by the companies we have agreed to indemnify xo for damages it incurs in this matter we have made counterclaims in the action against limelight alleging that limelight has infringed five akamai content delivery patents and we are seeking monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to the infringing technology used by limelight the case is scheduled for trial in may 2017 we currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide cloud services for delivering optimizing and securing content and business applications over the internet the key factors that influence our financial success are our ability to build on recurring revenue commitments for our performance and security offerings increase media traffic on our network develop new products and carefully manage our capital spending and other expenses 

revenue 

for most of our solutions our customers commit to contracts having terms of a year or longer which allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue in addition to a base level of revenue we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our services is more variable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of social media and video platform capabilities the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business the ability to expand our product portfolio and to maintain the prices we charge for our services are also key factors impacting our revenue growth 

we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

 

 

 

 



expenses 

our level of profitability is also impacted by our expenses including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

 

 

 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have also impacted our reported results revenue and expenses of our operations outside of the us are important contributors to our overall financial performance and as currencies have weakened against the us dollar our revenue has been negatively impacted and our expenses have been positively impacted if foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2016  had remained the same as exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2015  our revenue would have increased by 7 as opposed to 6 conversely diluted earnings per share would have decreased by 1 as opposed to increasing by 1 if foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2015 had remained the same as exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2014 our revenue would have increased by 16 as opposed to 12 similarly diluted earnings per share would have increased by 2 as opposed to decreasing 3 had exchange rates remained constant during the same period 

in recent years we have used strategic acquisitions to complement and augment existing technological capabilities during 2016 2015 and 2014 we completed various acquisitions which were immaterial to our financial results as a whole during those years but have contributed to increases in our revenue and level of expenses also in february 2014 we completed an offering of 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes the notes do not bear regular interest but have an effective interest rate of 32 attributable to the conversion feature 

  

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue from 2015  to 2016  was primarily the result of continued strong growth from our cloud security solutions which grew 43 our web performance solutions also contributed to our revenue growth in 2016 our overall revenue growth rate was lower than it has been in the past primarily due to the doityourself efforts of our internet platform customers some of which have developed internal infrastructure to deliver more of their media content themselves rather than rely on our media services revenue from these six customers amazon apple facebook google microsoft and netflix in the aggregate was 2504 million and 3793 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

the increase in our revenue from 2014  to 2015  was driven by higher demand for our services across all of our solutions and geographies with particularly strong growth from our cloud security solutions revenue from our internet platform customers was 3793 million and 3589 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue from our solution categories for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  in thousands 



the increases in performance and security solutions revenue for 2016  as compared to 2015  and 2015  as compared to 2014  were due to increased demand across all major product lines with especially strong growth in our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  was 3649 million  as compared to 2544 million  and 1700 million  for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014  respectively 

the decrease in media delivery solutions revenue for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily the result of decreased traffic from our internet platform customers resulting from their doityourself efforts in delivering their content our media delivery solutions for other customers revenue grew by 8 the increase in media delivery solutions revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to higher demand across most of our customer base 

the increases in services and support solutions revenue for 2016  as compared to 2015  and 2015  as compared to 2014  were due to strong new customer attachment rates for our professional services as well as purchases of upgrades to services by our existing customers 

as a result of our 2016 reorganization our sales marketing and product development functions are now organized into three divisions the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from the customers in each division in thousands 



the decline in the yearoveryear revenue growth rate in media division revenue in 2016  as compared to 2015  and the relatively small revenue improvement in 2015  over 2014  was the result of decreased traffic from our internet platform customers the yearoveryear revenue growth rate for our other customers was 13 and 8 for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

the increase in web division revenue for 2016  as compared to 2015  was due to growth in this customer base particularly with our cloud security solutions the increase in web division revenue in 2015  as compared to 2014  was due to strong demand across most of our customer base particularly for our cloud security solutions including from our largest most strategic customers 

the following table quantifies revenue derived in the us and internationally in thousands 



the reduced revenue from our internet platform customers negatively impacted our us revenue growth rates for the year ended december 31 2016 as these customers are based in the us for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 31  of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us compared to 27  for each of the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods 

during 2016  we continued to see strong revenue growth from our operations in the asia pacific region changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by 10 million  in 2016  as compared to 2015  and negatively by 717 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to increases in 

 

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to increases in 

 

we have longterm purchase commitments for colocation services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network and internet service providers our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding our bandwidth usage and colocation services purchase commitments 

we believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to higher bandwidth expenses associated with increased customer traffic on our network and the costs of efforts to increase our networks capacity and resiliency to combat potential attacks on our platform additionally during 2017  we anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs to increase as compared to 2016  along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our professional services personnel and related expenses we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2016  as compared to 2015  and 2015  as compared to 2014  were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development and network scaling partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31   2016 2015 and 2014  we capitalized 214 million  167 million  and 137 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years 

we believe that research and development expenses during 2017 will increase as compared to 2016 as we expect to continue to increase the number of development personnel through hiring or acquisition activity in order to make improvements to our core technology and support engineering innovation and the development of new services 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to a decrease in performancebased commissions earned and reduced spending on marketing programs and related costs as we moderated discretionary spending to align with our revenue growth rates the increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs as we invested in our sales and marketing organization as well as additional marketing programs and related costs in support of our gotomarket strategy and ongoing geographic expansion 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to increased payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth during 2016 we expect headcount growth consistent with historical levels in our sales and marketing organizations in 2017 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  

the increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2016  as compared to 2015  was primarily due to increases in 

 capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives particularly expansion of our facility footprint which 

increased facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization and 

 performancebased stockbased compensation from period to period 

the increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in 

 capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives particularly expansion of our general and administrative headcount and our facility footprint which increased payroll and related costs facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization and 

 

during 2017 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as compared to 2016 due to anticipated increased payroll and related costs and facilitiesrelated costs the increase in those expenses is expected to be attributable to increased hiring investments in information technology and the expansion of our facility footprint to support headcount growth which occurred throughout 2016 and is expected to continue in 2017 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2016 as compared to 2015 was attributable to the finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years partially offset by acquired intangible asset amortization acquired in 2015 and 2016 the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2015 as compared to 2014 was driven by the finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in earlier years in addition to the deceleration in recognition of customer backlogrelated intangible assets acquired from prolexic which had a short useful life 

based on acquired intangible assets at december 31 2016  future amortization is expected to be approximately 292 million  264 million  250 million  211 million  and 166 million  for the years ending december 31 2017  2018  2019  2020  and 2021  respectively 

restructuring charges 



the restructuring charges in 2016 were primarily the result of changes to our organizational structure to reorganize our products and development groups and global sales services and marketing teams into divisions centered on our solutions the restructuring charges relate to severance expenses for impacted employees and charges for internaluse software not yet placed into service that will not be completed and launched due to changing priorities as part of the reorganization the restructuring charges in 2015 and 2014 consisted of severance expenses for redundant employees associated with acquisitions completed during those years we do not expect to continue to incur significant restructuring charges as a result of any of these actions 

nonoperating income expense 



for the periods presented interest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest expense consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 

other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses mainly due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions the fluctuation in other income expense net for 2016 as compared to 2015 also includes the impact of gains recognized on the disposition of certain cost method investments other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events 

provision for income taxes 



for the year ended december 31 2016 the effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us the domestic production activities deduction and the us federal state and foreign research and development credits partially offset by the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation in intercompany arrangements the federal research and development credit the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us these benefits were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2014 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the federal research and development credit a state tax benefit from software development activities the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by state income taxes and the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments 

the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation on intercompany arrangements which occurred in 2015 a decrease in the us federal and state research and development credits and a change in the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions this increase in the provision for income taxes was partially offset by an increase in the domestic production activities deduction 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2015 as compared to 2014 was mainly due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation in intercompany arrangements and the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the statutory tax rates in the us these benefits were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decisionmaking for planning and forecasting purposes to measure executive compensation and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that facilitates meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they assist in the comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may also exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature infrequent or not reflective of our ongoing operating results 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income per diluted share to nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  share in thousands 



nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fullydiluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than 8956 the initial conversion price there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or are noncash in nature we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges benefit from adoption of software development activities gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business gains and losses on legal settlements costs incurred with respect to our internal fcpa investigation foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt amortization of debt discount and issuance costs amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken generally our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2016  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency securities totaled 16 billion  factoring in our convertible senior notes of 6900 million our net cash at december 31 2016 was 9263 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenues accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis 

as of december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 2280 million  held in accounts outside the us an immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to us federal taxation if repatriated with such tax liability partially offset by foreign tax credits the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us are subject to or offset by intercompany obligations to our parent company in the us and therefore are not subject to us federal taxation as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher cash collection from customers due to increased revenue and lower commissions and annual bonus payments due to lower award attainment levels these increases to cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by higher cash paid for taxes during 2016 as compared to 2015 accounts receivable days outstanding was 54 days as of the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 59 days as of the year ended december 31 2015 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for income taxes of 750 million versus 1662 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase is also due to an increase in cash collections from customers as a result of increased revenue offset by the increase in operating expenditures and the overall timing of our working capital payments accounts receivable days outstanding was 59 days as of the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 56 days as of the year ended december 31 2014 

cash used in investing activities 



the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by net marketable securities activity which was a net outflow for the year our excess cash as well as the proceeds from sales and maturities of our marketable securities were reinvested as compared to 2015 where we did not reinvest a portion of our proceeds in order to fund acquisitions this outflow is partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment during 2016 as compared 2015 as we moderated investment in our network additionally acquisitions during 2016 were of a smaller magnitude than those during 2015 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2015 partially relates to the acquisition of prolexic during 2014 with no corresponding acquisition of the same magnitude during 2015 net marketable securities activity also contributed to the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2014 we invested the proceeds from our convertible senior notes which caused the activity for marketable securities to be a net outflow the decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase of purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internaluse software during 2015 as compared to 2014 as we continued to invest in our network with the goal of enhancing and adding functionality to our service offerings 

cash used in provided by financing activities 



the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily the result of increased share repurchases in october 2013 the board of directors authorized a 7500 million share repurchase program effective from october 16 2013 through december 31 2016 in february 2016 the board of directors authorized a 10 billion share repurchase program that superseded the october 2013 repurchase program and became effective in february 2016 through december 31 2018 the companys goal for the share repurchase program is to offset the dilution created by its employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 70 million  45 million  and 46 million  shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 5328  6705  and 5802  respectively 

the decrease in cash from financing activities during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of the convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 and related note hedge and warrant transactions during 2015 we also increased our repurchases of common stock 

convertible senior notes 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we have used and intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

liquidity outlook 

we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our expected capital expenditures investments in information technology and facility expansion opportunistic business acquisitions anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2016  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2016  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  771 million  including  137 million  of accrued interest and penalties we believe that it is reasonably possible that 158 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2017 the settlement period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding 68 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until 2028  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2016 and 2015 was determined to be immaterial 

legal matters 

we are party to various litigation matters that management considers routine and incidental to its business management does not expect the results of any of these routine actions to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in november 2015 limelight filed a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia against akamai and xo communications llc or xo alleging patent infringement by the two companies the complaint alleges that akamai and xo infringed six of limelight’s content delivery patents the complaint seeks to recover from akamai and xo significant monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to infringing technology used by the companies we have agreed to indemnify xo for damages it incurs in this matter we have made counterclaims in the action against limelight alleging that limelight has infringed five akamai content delivery patents and we are seeking monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to the infringing technology used by limelight the case is scheduled for trial in may 2017 we currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material impact on our business 

significant accounting policies and estimates 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding recent and newly adopted accounting pronouncements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenue from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for contracts with a monthly commitment we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services – the delivery of content applications and software over the internet – as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services these elements have value to our customers on a standalone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor generally there is no right of return relative to these services 

we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements all standalone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average standalone selling price for those services for our core services the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately 

for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe third party evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we estimate besp based upon a managementapproved price list and preestablished discount levels for each solution that takes into consideration volume geography and industry lines we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2016 and 2015  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of marketbased restricted stock awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds and money market funds the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our consolidated statements of income within other income expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and operating expenses conversely our revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2016 and 2015  no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2016  the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the akamai intelligent platform which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us in our view we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings our customer service the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2015  we owned or had exclusive rights to more than 230 us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries our usissued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2016 and 2034 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had 6084  fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work

 item 1a    risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

if we do not continue to innovate and develop solutions and technologies that are useful for our customers or that improve our operating efficiencies our operating results may suffer 

we have been in business for more than 17 years and consider ourselves pioneers in the development of content and application delivery solutions as the information technology industry evolves however it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage in particular our traditional offerings risk becoming commoditized as competitors or even current or former customers seek to replicate them such that we must lower the prices we charge reducing the profitability of such offerings or risk losing such business we believe therefore that developing innovative highmargin solutions is key to our revenue growth and profitability we must do so in a rapidly changing technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers and where competitors may develop products and services that are or may be viewed as better than ours the process of developing new solutions is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning timing or execution technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources failure to adequately develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and to keep pace with rapid technological and market changes could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

slower traffic growth on our network and numerous other factors could cause our revenue growth rate to slow and profitability to decline 

we base our decisions about expense levels and investments on estimates of our future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with colocation and bandwidth providers so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early if we experience slower traffic growth on our network than we expect or than we have experienced in recent years our revenue growth rate will slow and we may not be able to maintain our current level of profitability in 2016 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter numerous factors can impact traffic growth including 

 

our revenue growth rate may slow and profitability may decline in future periods as a result of a number of other factors unrelated to traffic growth including 

 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete are constantly evolving which makes our future business strategies practices and results difficult to predict 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete have grown rapidly over the life of our company and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances changing business models and other factors we and the other companies that compete in this industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to 

 

as a result of this constantly changing environment our future business strategies practices and results may be difficult to predict and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes 

our technological approach to addressing the challenges of conducting business over the internet may not be adequate or cost effective to handle evolving market forces 

we believe that the internet has the potential to experience dramatic growth in the future for example only a minority of individuals watch television over the internet now but many predict that the internet will become the dominant medium for delivery of video content in the future in addition the use of mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years and is expected to continue to grow in the future there could develop an inflection point above which global usage of the internet increases to a level that our current approaches to the delivery of content and applications may not be sustainable at current levels of profitability or at all it is expensive to deploy dedicated servers in data centers around the world therefore that approach of deploying at the edge of the internet may be inadequate to fully address our customers evolving needs or we may no longer be able to maintain our current approach to delivery if we are unable to develop or acquire scalable new technologies to address the expected growth and other changes we expect our business and financial statements may suffer 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size product and service offerings and geographic region and range from startups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are excellence of technology global presence customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength competitors include some of our current partners and customers 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 

 

existing and potential customers may not purchase our services or may limit their use of them because they 

 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operating results can be impacted by the actions and business life cycles of a small number of large customers 

historically our operating results have been subject to fluctuations related to dependence on several large customers particularly media companies for a significant portion of our revenues the amount of traffic we deliver on behalf of those customers can vary significantly based on decisions they make about their businesses including whether to start or delay new business initiatives build out their own networks to handle delivery or implement or maintain multiple vendor strategies these approaches can change rapidly and unpredictably while we believe that we will be less reliant on individual customers in the future we are likely to continue to face some uncertainty in forecasting our revenues from quarter to quarter or over longer periods related to these customers and could also experience inconsistent revenue growth patterns and earnings 

we may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations renewals at lower rates or other less favorable terms 

it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers and increasing the number of highmargin services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase we cannot predict our renewal rates some customers may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths historically a significant percentage of our renewals particularly with larger customers has involved unit price declines as competition has increased and the market for certain parts of our business has matured our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors including competitive pressures customer dissatisfaction with our services customers inability to continue their operations and spending levels the impact of multivendor policies customers implementing or increasing their use of inhouse technology solutions and general economic conditions in addition our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would negatively impact revenue 

security breaches and other unplanned interruptions in the functioning of our network or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet we transmit and store our customers information and data as well as our own maintaining the security and availability of our services network and internal it systems is a critical issue for us and our customers the costs to us to avoid or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service loss of existing or potential customers liability to third parties and regulatory sanctions as we expand our emphasis on selling securityrelated solutions we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure intended to steal information about our technology financial data or customer information or take other actions that would be damaging to our customers and us our network or services could also be disrupted by numerous other events including failure or refusal of our third party network providers to provide the necessary capacity natural disasters power losses and human error any significant breach of our security measures or other disruptions to our network or it systems would threaten our ability to provide our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet would harm our reputation and could lead to customer credits loss of customers higher expenses and increased legal liability 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

acquisitions are an important part of our corporate strategy we may also enter into other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations as we complete acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals it is also important to our continued success that we hire qualified employees properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful at these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

in february 2016 we announced that our current products and development and global sales channels and marketing organizations will be realigned into new groups initially focused on our media and web customers and solutions with a goal of improving alignment between customer feedback and product innovation making akamai easier to do business with and increasing productivity each group will integrate existing personnel from product management product development sales channels and product marketing functions into its team effective in april 2016 structural changes like these can be distracting to management and the rest of the employee base and we may not ultimately realize the intended benefits even after incurring expenses in carrying out the realignment 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our it and operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to manage our technical support infrastructure effectively and improve our sales efficiency we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements may be difficult and costly if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected if the third parties we rely on for hosted data solutions for our internal network and information systems are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services we utilize the integrity and availability of our internal information could be compromised causing the loss of confidential or proprietary information damage to our reputation and economic loss 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones in making employment decisions particularly in our industry job candidates and current personnel often consider the value of stockbased compensation declines in the price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees 

none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations and detrimental to our future outlook the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenue particularly that portion attributable to usage of our services beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our services in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyougo approach the absence of a commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would create additional challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly as a result 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad stock market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

we face risks associated with international operations and expansion efforts that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our operations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures which could harm our profitability we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs make our operations less efficient and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations by our employees or partners could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our financial statements although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws 

in particular we are conducting an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel relating to sales practices in a country outside the us the investigation includes a review of compliance with the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws and regulations by employees in that market if violations are found we may be subject to penalties which could include substantial fines 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our solutions or subject us to substantial liability 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our services and platform that have given rise to service incidents we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery and other services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our services or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and legal actions by our customers 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in disruptions to our services and loss of revenue 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business networks imposing traffic limits or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations in some regions network providers may 

choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices this risk is heightened where market power is concentrated with one or a few major networks we also may be unable to move quickly enough to augment capacity to reflect growing traffic demands failure to put in place the capacity we require could result in a reduction in or disruption of service to our customers and ultimately a loss of those customers in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue in addition customers have increasingly elected to transmit their content over our ssl network which is more costly for us to operate and could require significant additional investment for us these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our profitability 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could negatively impact our business while regulations recently adopted by the us federal communications commission that govern certain aspects of the operation of the internet such as content blocking and throttling and paid prioritization do not apply to content delivery network providers like us there is no guarantee that future regulatory and legislative initiatives will not impact our business furthermore with more business being conducted over the internet there have been calls for more stringent copyright protection tax consumer protection cybersecurity data localization and content restriction laws both in the us and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services 

we may also be impacted by changes in privacyrelated regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others complying with a diverse range of privacy requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business in addition we have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning our collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from international operations revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be fully effective 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims including those that may arise under international laws in many cases we have agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our services infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or channel or strategic partners if our services or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or channel or strategic partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology we have licensed technology from the massachusetts institute of technology that is covered by various patents and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights these patents are scheduled to expire beginning in 2018 as the patents expire we will no longer have the right to exclude others from practicing the technologies covered by them furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable opensource software may have security flaws and other deficiencies that could make our solutions less reliable and damage our business certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost 

we may be unsuccessful at developing and maintaining strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenue which could significantly limit our longterm growth 

our future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators product makers and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenue the need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the us we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force a past lack of strategic focus on such arrangements and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services and ensuring that they are compliant with our ethical expectations requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channels those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

the potential exhaustion of the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses and the inability of akamai and other internet users to successfully transition to ipv6 could harm our operations and the functioning of the internet as a whole thereby negatively affecting our business 

an internet protocol address or ip address is a numerical label that is assigned to any device connecting to the internet today the functioning of the internet is dependent on the use of internet protocol version 4 or ipv4 the fourth version of the internet protocol which uses 32bit addresses we currently rely on the acquisition of ip addresses for the functioning and expansion of our network and expect such reliance to continue in the future there are however only a finite number of ipv4 addresses the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses is likely to be exhausted in the near future internet protocol version 6 or ipv6 uses 128bit addresses and has been designed to succeed ipv4 and alleviate the expected exhaustion of unallocated addresses under that version while ipv4 and ipv6 will coexist for some period of time eventually all internet users and companies will need to transition to ipv6 there can be no guarantee that the plans we have been developing for the transition to ipv6 will be effective if we are unable to obtain the ipv4 addresses we need on financial terms acceptable to us or at all before we or other entities that rely on the internet can transition to ipv6 our current and future operations could be materially harmed if there is not a timely and successful transition to ipv6 by internet users generally the internet could function less effectively which could damage numerous businesses the economy generally and the prospects for future growth of the internet as a medium for transacting business this could in turn be harmful to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will require 

significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of december 31 2015 we had total par value of 6900 million of convertible senior notes outstanding our ability to refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase those notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business in addition the terms of the notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore are more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we may become involved in litigation that may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore because such matters are inherently unpredictable there can be no assurance that the results of any of these matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenue additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

global climate change and natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business 

our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers and investors may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business the costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

because we do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock as a result the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide cloud services for delivering optimizing and securing content and business applications over the internet for many of our core solutions we rely on a recurring revenue model with customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer we believe this emphasis on longerterm contracts allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue which is important to our financial success we are also dependent on media customers where usage of our services is less predictable as a result our revenue is impacted by the amount of media and software download traffic we serve on our network the rate of adoption of social media and video platform capabilities the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events and the impact of seasonal variations on our business the prices we are able to charge for our services is also a key factor impacting income 

during each of the periods presented in this annual report we increased revenue over the prior year and we have observed the following trends related to our revenue 

 

 

 

 

 

we were profitable in each of the years presented in this annual report our level of profitability is impacted by our revenue as well as expense levels including direct costs to support our revenue such as bandwidth and colocation costs we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

 

 

increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels but we believe such costs would be partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit and efficiency measures we take 

 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have also impacted our reported results revenue and expenses of our operations outside of the us are important contributors to our overall financial performance and as currencies have weakened against the us dollar our revenue has been negatively impacted and our expenses have been positively impacted if foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2015  had remained the same as exchange rates during the year ended december 31 2014  our revenue would have increased by 16  as opposed to 12  similarly diluted earnings per share would have increased 2 as opposed to decreasing 3 had exchange rates remained constant during the same period 

during 2015 we completed three acquisitions while the impact of the acquisitions was immaterial to our financial results as a whole they have increased our revenue and level of expenses during the year ended december 31 2015  our results include the activities of the acquisition of xerocole inc in february 2015 codemate as and its whollyowned subsidiary octoshape aps in april 2015 and bloxx limited in october 2015 

during 2014 we acquired prolexic technologies inc or prolexic prolexic was slightly dilutive to our earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2014 revenue and expenses from the acquired operations have been included in our earnings since the acquisition date of february 18 2014 also in february 2014 we completed an offering of 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes the notes do not bear regular interest but have an effective interest rate of 32 attributable to the conversion feature 

during 2013 we completed two acquisitions although our financial statements include revenue and expenses of the acquired companies following their acquisitions the impact was not material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial results in the first quarter of 2013 we also divested our ads business 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of income data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue from 2014  to 2015  was driven by continued strong demand for our services across all of our solutions and geographies with particularly strong growth from our cloud security solutions we experienced moderation in the rate of revenue growth particularly in the second half of 2015 from our media delivery solutions the moderation was primarily due to an increase in doityourself approaches by our two largest media customers based in the us which led to a slower overall rate of growth of customer traffic on our network 

the increase in our revenue from 2013  to 2014  was driven by continued strong demand for our services across all of our major solutions and geographies in particular we experienced the addition of new customers increased sales of incremental services to our existing customers and amounts earned for traffic usage in excess of committed amounts as well as customerspecific onetime events in addition the acquisition of prolexic during the first quarter of 2014 contributed to increased revenue these contributions to higher revenue were partially offset by lost committed recurring revenue and price declines 

for the year ended december 31 2015  resellers accounted for 26  of revenue as compared to 25  and 21  of revenue for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  respectively the increase in revenue from resellers was attributable to increased traction with our carrier channel partners for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of revenue 

the following table quantifies revenue derived in the us and internationally in thousands 



for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  approximately 27  of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods our us revenue has been impacted by reduced revenue from our largest media delivery solutions customers which contributed to the slowing of the growth rate in our us revenue 

during 2015  we experienced strong revenue growth from our operations in the asia pacific region and continued improvement in revenue growth from our operations in europe the middle east and africa but we continued to be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by 717 million  in 2015 as compared to 2014 and by 78 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013  

the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue from our solution categories for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  in thousands growth rates in constant currency for the year ended december 31 2014 exclude the impact of revenue from the ads business that was divested during the three months ended march 31 2013 



the increases in performance and security solutions revenue for 2015  as compared to 2014  and 2014  as compared to 2013  were due to increased demand across all major product lines with especially strong growth in our cloud security solutions cloud security solutions revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  was 2544 million  as compared to 1700 million  and 597 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013  respectively additionally the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was partially attributable to the acquisition of prolexic 

the increase in media delivery solutions revenue for 2015  as compared to 2014  was due to higher demand across most of our customer base as discussed above the year over year rate of revenue growth for these solutions slowed particularly from our two largest media accounts and the impact of their doityourself efforts in 2014 we also saw unseasonably high traffic levels and revenue from larger media accounts along with several large software and gaming releases that did not repeat in 2015 negatively impacting periodoverperiod revenue growth we expect this moderation of revenue growth for media delivery solutions to continue into 2016 

the increase in media delivery solutions revenue in 2014  as compared to 2013  was due to strong demand across most of our customer base including from our largest most strategic customers during 2014  we experienced particularly strong growth from our social media gaming video and software download customers 

the increases in the service and support solutions revenue for 2015  as compared to 2014  and 2014  as compared to 2013  were due to strong new customer attachment rates for our professional services and service offering upgrades purchased by our installed base 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to increases in 

 

the increase in total cost of revenue for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to increases in 

 

we have longterm purchase commitments for colocation services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network and internet service providers our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding our bandwidth usage and colocation services purchase commitments 

we believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2016  as compared to 2015  primarily because we expect to deploy more servers and deliver more traffic on our network which will result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however our anticipated increases in cost of revenue are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit and continued efficiency in network deployment additionally during 2016  we anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs to increase as compared to 2015  along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our network and professional services personnel and related expenses we plan to continue making investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing customers including ott video traffic 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2015  as compared to 2014  and 2014  as compared to 2013  were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of continued growth in headcount to support investments in new product development and network scaling partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization these development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31   2015 2014 and 2013  we capitalized 167 million  137 million  and 115 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years 

we believe that research and development expenses during 2016 will increase as compared to 2015 as we continue to make improvements to our core technology and support the development of new services and engineering innovation 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2015  as compared to 2014  and 2014  as compared to 2013  were primarily due to higher payroll and related costs as we invested in our sales and marketing organization as well as additional marketing programs and related costs in support of our gotomarket strategy and ongoing geographic expansion 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase during 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth throughout 2015 and into 2016 we expect headcount growth in 2016 but at a slower pace than we experienced in 2015 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  

general and administrative expenses include costs of our finance human resources information technology legal and administrative network infrastructure functions in addition to our facilityrelated costs and depreciation of facilityrelated capital assets the increases in general and administrative expenses for 2015  as compared to 2014  and 2014  as compared to 2013  were primarily due to the expansion of company infrastructure to support investments in engineering gotomarket capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives in particular we increased general and administrative headcount and our facility footprint which increased payroll and related costs facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization in the year ended december 31 2015  we increased the number of softwareasaservice or saas solutions that we use as compared to 2014 which contributed to the increase in professional fees and other expenses along with increases in legal and other professional consulting fees in addition acquisitionrelated costs were higher for 2014  as compared to both 2015 and 2013  due to the acquisition of prolexic 

during 2016 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as compared to 2015 due to anticipated increased payroll and related costs and facilitiesrelated costs the increase in those expenses is expected to be attributable to increased hiring investments in information technology and the expansion of our facility footprint to support headcount growth which occurred throughout 2015 and is expected to continue in 2016 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014 was driven by the finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in earlier years in addition to the deceleration in recognition of customer backlogrelated intangible assets acquired from prolexic which have a short useful life the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets was only partially offset by amortization from intangible assets related to acquisitions completed in 2015 the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2014  as compared to 2013  was due to the acquisition of prolexic 

based on acquired intangible assets at december 31 2015  future amortization is expected to be approximately 265 million  278 million  237 million  217 million  and 177 million  for the years ending december 31 2016  2017  2018  2019  and 2020  respectively 

restructuring charges 



the restructuring charges in 2015 consisted of severance expenses for redundant employees associated with acquisitions completed during the year the 2014 restructuring charges consisted of severance and related expenses for redundant employees acquired as part of the acquisition of prolexic in addition to a facility contract termination fee during 2013 we recorded a restructuring charge for leasehold improvements that were no longer in use as a result of an early lease termination in addition we incurred severance and relocation expenses for employees impacted by the closing of the facility 

during 2016 we expect to incur severance charges as a result of changes to our organizational structure the charges relate to a few individuals and are the result of a realignment of our products and development and global sales services and marketing groups into organizations centered on our solutions 

nonoperating income expense 



for the periods presented interest income consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest expense consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 

other expense net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses and other nonoperating expense and income items the fluctuations in other expense net for 2015 as compared to 2014 and 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions other expense net may fluctuate in the future based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates or other events 

provision for income taxes 



for the year ended december 31 2015  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation in intercompany arrangements the federal research and development credit the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us these benefits were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the federal research and development credit a state tax benefit from software development activities the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by state income taxes and the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments 

for the year ended december 31 2013  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate mainly due to the retroactive adoption of the domestic production activities deduction the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit which included a onetime retroactive impact for fiscal 2012 and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by state income taxes 

the decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2015 as compared to 2014  was mainly due to the retroactive application of a us tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stockbased compensation in intercompany arrangements and the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the statutory tax rates in the us these benefits were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments 

the increase in the provision for income taxes for 2014 as compared to 2013 was mainly due to the increase in operating income and a change in the composition of income in different jurisdictions partially offset by the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit the federal domestic production activities deduction and state software development activities benefit 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on accounting principles generally accepted in the us or gaap we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and impact of foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business as they exclude expenses and gains that may be infrequent unusual in nature or not reflective of our ongoing operating results management also believes that these nongaap financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management these nongaap financial measures may also facilitate comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 

 

and future periods difficult to interpret therefore we believe it is useful to exclude stockbased compensation and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation from our nongaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  in thousands 



other operating expenses excluded from the nongaap results presented in the table above includes acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges divestiture gains and certain legal matter costs 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  in thousands except per share data 



other operating expenses excluded from the nongaap results presented in the table above includes acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges divestiture gains and certain legal matter costs 

nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully diluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share until our weighted average stock price is greater than 8956 the initial conversion price there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following 

items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation other operating expenses comprised of acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges benefit from adoption of software development activities gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business gains and losses on legal settlements and costs incurred with respect to our internal investigation relating to sales practices in a country outside the us foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt amortization of debt discount and issuance costs amortization of capitalized interest expense certain gains and losses on investments and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial results consequently our financial results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing it to the reported amount the percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2015  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency securities totaled 15 billion  factoring in our convertible senior notes our net cash at december 31 2015 was 8342 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet highquality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenues accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash 

position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make investments at opportune times we expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis 

as of december 31 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1853 million  held in accounts outside the us an immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to us federal taxation if repatriated with such tax liability partially offset by foreign tax credits the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us are subject to or offset by intercompany obligations to our parent company in the us and therefore are not subject to us federal taxation as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2015 as compared to 2014  was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for income taxes of 750 million  versus 1662 million  for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase is also due to an increase in cash collections from customers as a result of increased revenue offset by the increase in operating expenditures and the overall timing of our working capital payments accounts receivable days outstanding was 59 days as of the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 56 days as of the year ended december 31 2014  

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased profitability and the resulting cash collections from customers offset by payments of working capital and the timing of those payments cash paid for income taxes also impacted cash flows provided by operating activities which increased by 1027 million from 2013 to 2014 during 2014 we paid taxes related to the acquisition of prolexic which contributed to the increase 

we expect cash provided by operating activities to increase in 2016 due to an expected increase in cash collections related to anticipated higher revenue partially offset by an anticipated increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as payroll and payrollrelated costs 

cash used in investing activities 



the decrease in cash used in investing activities partially relates to the acquisition of prolexic during 2014 with no corresponding acquisition of the same magnitude during 2015 net marketable securities activity also contributed to the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2014 we invested the proceeds from our convertible senior notes which caused the activity for marketable securities to be a net outflow the decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase of purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internaluse software during 2015 as compared to 2014 as we continued to invest in our network with the goal of enhancing and adding functionality to our service offerings 

the increase in cash used in investing activities for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of prolexic with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013 the increase also relates to the increase in net purchases of marketable securities as a result of the investment of the proceeds of our convertible senior notes issuance 

additionally expenditures for internaluse software development increased as we continued to invest in our network with the goal of enhancing and adding functionality to our service offerings 

cash used in provided by financing activities 



the decrease in cash from financing activities during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily the result of the convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 and related note hedge and warrant transactions during 2015 we also increased our repurchases of common stock 

cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was primarily the result of the convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 and related note hedge and warrant transactions concurrent with the convertible senior notes issuance we also repurchased 620 million of our common stock which contributed to the increase in repurchases of common stock as compared to 2013 

in october 2013  the board of directors authorized a 7500 million  share repurchase program effective from october 16 2013 through december 31 2016 the goal of the program was to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans during 2015 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 45 million  46 million  and 39 million  shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 6705  5802  and 4116  respectively pursuant to the current repurchase program as well as prior programs approved by the board of directors 

in february 2016 the board of directors authorized a new 10 billion  share repurchase program effective from february 9 2016 through december 31 2018 our goal for this program is to offset the dilution created by our employee equity compensation programs and provide the flexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions warrant 

convertible senior notes 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases in addition to the 620 million in repurchases discussed above working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

liquidity outlook 

we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs in addition to our recurring operating costs include our planned capital expenditures investments in information technology and facility expansion as well as anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2015  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  723 million  including  100 million  of accrued interest and penalties we believe that none of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 2016 the settlement period for the entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding 60 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until 2024  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements the fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2015 and 2014 was determined to be immaterial 

legal matters 

we are party to various litigation matters that management considers routine and incidental to its business management does not expect the results of any of these routine actions to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are conducting an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel relating to sales practices in a country outside the us that represented less than 1  of our revenue in each of the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the internal investigation includes a review of compliance with the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws and regulations by employees in that market in february 2015 we voluntarily contacted the us securities and exchange commission and department of justice to advise both agencies of this internal investigation we are cooperating with those agencies as of the filing of these financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of this matter no provision with respect to this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued updated guidance and disclosure requirements for recognizing revenue the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this standard will be effective for us on january 1 2018 and may be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new accounting guidance 

in april 2015 the fasb issued updated guidance that will change the current presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet this new guidance will move debt issuance costs from the assets section of the balance sheet to the liabilities section as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt issued the guidance will be effective for us on january 1 2016 we will reclassify our debt issuance costs included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet to convertible senior notes within the liabilities and stockholders equity section the amount of deferred financing costs expected to be reclassified as of january 1 2016 is 62 million this revision will have no impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2015 the fasb issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in an effort to reduce complexity in financial reporting the new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment including the impact on prior periods be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified the standard will be effective for us on january 1 2016 we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in november 2015 the fasb issued guidance that requires companies to present deferred income tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead of the current requirement to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts the standard is effective for us on january 1 2016 but early adoption is permitted we adopted this standard as of december 31 2015 and applied it prospectively we early adopted the standard because it simplifies our process of determining balance sheet classification for our deferred taxes prior period deferred income tax assets and liabilities have not been adjusted due to the prospective application of the standard the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenue from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for contracts with a monthly commitment we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services – the delivery of content applications and software over the internet – as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services these elements have value to our customers on a standalone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor generally there is no right of return relative to these services 

we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements all standalone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average standalone selling price for those services for our core services the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately 

for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe third party evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we estimate besp based upon a managementapproved price list and preestablished discount levels for each solution that takes into consideration volume geography and industry lines we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2015 and 2014  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that we believe has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including us government agency obligations highquality corporate debt securities commercial paper mutual funds and money market funds the majority of our investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations that could impact our business including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

transaction exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our statements of income within other expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses from these forward contracts were determined to be immaterial during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

translation exposure 

to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased revenue and decreased operating expenses conversely our revenue will decrease and our operating expenses will increase when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our consolidated financial condition as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2015 and 2014  no customer had an accounts receivable balance of 10 or more of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2015  the concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was insignificant

making the cloud work for our customers 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other enterprises conduct business and reach the public enterprises want to offer a dynamic consistent secure experience for millions of end users and to take advantage of the potential cost savings of cloud computing – using third party server facilities to enable internet operations the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of todays communication demands or the dramatic expansion in the number and types of devices individuals use to access it the ad hoc architecture of the internet presents potential problems for its widespread usage today such as 

 

these potential problems intersect with the features of what is sometimes referred to as the hyperconnected world including 

 

achieving an enterprises goals in the face of these challenges is made more difficult by internal technology issues driven by competition globalization and expensecontainment strategies companies need an agile cloudbased infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives the dramatic increase in internet usage places extensive demands on infrastructure however expanding internal systems to meet even routine demand can be expensive keeping pace with new developments can also be a difficult challenge special marketing or promotional initiatives or unanticipated onetime events such as important unanticipated news may draw millions of additional visitors to a companys website over a brief period of time putting in place incremental internal infrastructure to deal with such spikes is usually impractical and costprohibitive network operators themselves are challenged to profitably manage consumer access to the internet over their networks recouping the costs of the infrastructure buildouts they need to make is generally not supported by their traditional business models

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2014  we owned or had exclusive rights to 230 issued us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries we also have numerous additional us and foreign country patent applications pending our usissued patents extend to various dates between 2015 and 2033 we do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had 5105  fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work 




 item 1a    risk factors 

the following are important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

if we do not continue to innovate and develop solutions and technologies that are useful for our customers or that improve our operating efficiencies our operating results may suffer 

we have been in business for approximately 15 years and consider ourselves pioneers in the development of content and application delivery solutions as the information technology industry evolves however it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage in particular our traditional offerings risk becoming commoditized as competitors or even current or former customers seek to replicate them such that we must lower the prices we charge reducing the profitability of such offerings we believe therefore that developing innovative highmargin solutions is key to our revenue growth and profitability we must do so in a rapidly changing technology environment where it can be difficult to anticipate the needs of potential customers and where competitors may develop products and services that are or may be viewed as better than ours the process of developing new solutions is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or features without knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept this could cause our expenses to grow more rapidly than our revenue furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning timing or execution technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources failure to adequately develop on a costeffective basis innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and to keep pace with rapid technological and market changes could have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we believe that the internet has the potential to experience dramatic growth in the future for example only a relatively small percentage of individuals watch television over the internet now but many predict that the internet will become the dominant medium for delivery of video content in the future in addition the use of mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years and is expected to continue to grow in the future there could develop an inflection point above which global usage of the internet increases to a level that our current approaches to the delivery of content and applications may not be sustainable at current levels of profitability or at all it is expensive to deploy dedicated servers in data centers around the world therefore that approach to deploying at the edge of the internet may be inadequate to fully address our customers evolving needs if we are unable to develop or acquire scalable new technologies to address the expected growth and other changes we expect our business and financial statements may suffer 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete are constantly evolving which makes our future business strategies practices and results difficult to predict 

the information technology industry and the markets in which we compete have grown rapidly over the life of our company and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances changing business models and other factors we and the other companies that compete in the industry and these markets experience continually shifting business relationships commercial focuses and business priorities all of which occur in reaction to industry and market forces and the emergence of new opportunities these shifts have led or could lead to 

 

as a result of this constantly changing environment our future business strategies practices and results may be difficult to predict and we may face operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes 

if we are unable to compete effectively our business will be adversely affected 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size service offerings and geographic region and range from start ups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are excellence of technology global presence customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength competitors include some of our current partners and customers 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 

existing and potential customers may not purchase our services or may limit their use of them because they 

 

consequently our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to replace lost revenue due to customer cancellations renewals at lower rates or other less favorable terms 

 it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers and increasing the number of highmargin services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase we cannot predict our renewal rates some customers may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths historically a significant percentage of our renewals particularly with larger customers have involved unit price declines as competition has increased and the market for certain parts of our business has matured our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors including competitive pressures customer dissatisfaction with our services customers inability to continue their operations and spending levels the impact of dual vendor policies customers implementing or increasing their use of inhouse technology solutions and general economic conditions in addition our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyou go approach the absence of a commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would increase the risk of lower revenue 

we may be unsuccessful at developing and maintaining strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenue which could significantly limit our longterm growth 

our future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators product makers and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenue the need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the united states we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force a past lack of strategic focus on such arrangements and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services and ensuring that they are compliant with our ethical expectations requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channels those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

numerous other factors could cause our revenue growth rate and profitability to decline 

our revenue growth rate and profitability may decline in future periods as a result of a number of other factors including 

 

we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth many of our expenses are fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with colocation and bandwidth providers so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early we also face higher expenses due to increased headcount and if customers shift significant amounts of their traffic to our secure socket layer or ssl network therefore if our revenue does not increase as forecasted we may not be able to maintain our current level of profitability in 2015 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

security breaches and other unplanned interruptions in the functioning of our network or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet we transmit and store our customers information and data as well as our own maintaining the security and availability of our services network and internal it systems is a critical issue for us and our customers the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers as we expand our emphasis on selling securityrelated solutions we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure intended to steal information about our technology financial data or customer information or take other actions that would be damaging to our customers and us our network or services could also be disrupted by numerous other events including failure or refusal of our third party network providers to provide the necessary capacity natural disasters power losses and human error any significant breach of our security measures or other disruptions to our network or it systems would threaten our ability to provide our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet would harm our reputation and could lead to customer credits loss of customers higher expenses and increased legal liability 

acquisitions and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties dilution diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

acquisitions are an important part of our corporate strategy we may also enter into other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations as we complete acquisitions we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with a future acquisition combination or strategic relationship if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

our failure to effectively manage our operations as our business evolves could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most key management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals 

we have greatly increased our employee base in recent years and have brought in hundreds of new employees through acquisitions it is important to our continued success that we hire qualified employees properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful at these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to manage our technical support infrastructure effectively and improve our sales efficiency we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that we do not control if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected if the third parties we rely on for hosted data solutions for our internal network and information systems are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services we utilize the integrity and availability of our internal information could be compromised causing the loss of confidential or proprietary information damage to our reputation and economic loss 

we face risks associated with international operations and expansion efforts that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support operations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures which could harm our profitability we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations by our employees or partners could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our financial statements although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws 

in particular we are conducting an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel relating to sales practices in a country outside the us the investigation includes a review of compliance with the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws and regulations by employees in that market if violations are found we may be subject to penalties which could include substantial fines 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our solutions and subject us to substantial liability 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our services and platform we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our services or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenue and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and legal actions by our customers if we elect to move into new areas that involve legal and regulatory complexities such as monetizing data providing regulated telecommunications services or handling personally identifiable information the potential risks we face and magnitude of losses could increase 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in disruptions to our services and loss of revenue 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business networks imposing traffic limits or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations in some regions network providers may choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices this risk is heightened where market power is concentrated with one or a few major networks we also may be unable to move quickly enough to augment capacity to reflect growing traffic demands failure to put in place the capacity we require could result in a reduction in or disruption to service to our customers and ultimately loss of those customers in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue in addition customers have increasingly elected to transmit their content over our ssl network which is more costly for us to operate and could require 

significant additional investment for us these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our profitability 

government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet through net neutrality rules or other legislation treaties or regulations could negatively impact our business even if our business is not the direct target of such regulations furthermore the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent copyright protection tax consumer protection cybersecurity content antidiscrimination and privacy laws both in the us and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

an increasing portion of our revenue is derived from international operations revenue generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be fully effective 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenue particularly those attributable to usage of our services beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our services in the future our customer contracting models may change to move away from a committed revenue structure to a payasyou go approach the absence of a commitment would make it easier for customers to stop doing business with us which would create additional challenges with our forecasting processes because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly in reaction 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices of stock of publiclytraded technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of december 31 2014 we had total par value of 6900 million of convertible senior notes outstanding our ability to refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase those notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness at such time could adversely affect our operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for additional capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to the stock of existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business in addition the terms of the notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire and retain qualified sales technical marketing and support personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones in making employment decisions particularly in our industry job candidates and current personnel often consider the value of stockbased compensation they are to or currently receive in connection with their employment declines in the price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees and result in increased employee compensation expenses 

none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations and detrimental to our future outlook the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

we may become involved in litigation that may adversely impact our business 

from time to time we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore because such matters are inherently unpredictable there can be no assurance that the results of any of these matters will not have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

as we expand our business and develop new technologies products and services we may become increasingly 

subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims including those that may arise under international laws in many cases we have agreed to indemnify our customers and channel and strategic partners if our services infringe or misappropriate specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation or claims brought against customers or strategic partners if our services or technology are the subject of such allegations any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers or channel or strategic partners could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable in 2014 the supreme court of the united states ruled against us in a case involving claims under one of our patents there can be no assurance that evolving interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries will not limit the scope and enforceability and therefore the value of our patents monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent unauthorized use of our technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from the massachusetts institute of technology or mit technology that is covered by various patents and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business these patents are scheduled to expire beginning in 2018 as the patents expire we will no longer have the right to exclude others from practicing the technologies covered by them 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could be expensive and divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost 

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

significant portions of our business depend on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats such as those used by companies like adobe microsoft apple and google owners of proprietary content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

the potential exhaustion of the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses and the inability of akamai and other internet users to successfully transition to ipv6 could harm our operations and the functioning of the internet as a whole thereby negatively affecting our business 

an internet protocol address or ip address is a numerical label that is assigned to any device connecting to the internet today the functioning of the internet is dependent on the use of internet protocol version 4 or ipv4 the fourth version of the internet protocol which uses 32bit addresses we currently rely on the acquisition of ip addresses for the functioning and expansion of our network and expect such reliance to continue in the future there are however only a finite number of ipv4 addresses the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses is likely to be exhausted in the near future internet protocol version 6 or ipv6 uses 128bit addresses and has been designed to succeed ipv4 and alleviate the expected exhaustion of unallocated addresses under that version while ipv4 and ipv6 will coexist for some period of time eventually all internet users and companies will need to transition to ipv6 there can be no guarantee that the plans we have been developing for the transition to ipv6 will be effective if we are unable to obtain the ipv4 addresses we need on financial terms acceptable to us or at all before we or other entities that rely on the internet can transition to ipv6 our current and future operations could be materially harmed if there is not a timely and successful transition to ipv6 by internet users generally the internet could function less effectively which could damage numerous businesses the economy generally and the prospects for future growth of the internet as a medium for transacting business this could in turn be harmful to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software development costs investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect among other things the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates our reserves and the positions we have taken are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal control over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business accordingly this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes including by expanding our operations in different markets increasing reliance on channel partners and completing acquisitions our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with potentially varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we have customer contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors combine to potentially limit the revenue we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex than those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor in economies outside the united states could have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenue additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

global climate change regulations could adversely impact our business 

our deployed network of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels in response to concerns about global climate change governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business it is possible that future regulatory or legislative initiatives or customer demands could affect the costs of operating our network of servers and our other operations such costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenue and damage to our reputation 

our business could be adversely impacted as a result of war acts of terrorism natural disasters or climate change 

terrorist acts acts of war natural disasters or the direct and indirect effects of climate change such as sea level rise increased storm severity drought flooding wildfires pandemics and social unrest from resource depletion and rising food prices may cause damage or disruption to our employees facilities customers partners suppliers distributors and resellers which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

because we do not intend to pay dividends stockholders will benefit from an investment in our stock only if it appreciates in value 

we currently intend to retain our future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our stock as a result the success of an investment in our stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value there is no guarantee that our stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to control or acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we provide cloud services for delivering optimizing and securing online content and business applications we primarily derive income from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer we believe that this emphasis on longerterm contracts generally allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue which is important to our financial success we have been able to increase our revenue and profitability in recent years because we have expanded our customer base and increased the amount and value of services features and functionalities that our customers purchase these achievements have enabled us to limit the impact of customer cancellations and terminations and price reductions resulting from contract renewals continuing these trends requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of the quality price and overall attractiveness of our services and technology 

our revenue is impacted primarily by factors such as the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events the prices we are able to charge for our services the amount of traffic we serve on our network and the impact of seasonal variations on our business we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years 

 

 

 

our profitability is also impacted by our expense levels including direct costs to support our revenue such as colocation and bandwidth costs and expenses incurred to support strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate revenue in the future we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years 

 

 

 

 

 

in february 2014 we completed the acquisition of prolexic prolexic was slightly dilutive to our earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2014 revenue and expenses from the acquired operations have been included in our earnings since the acquisition date of february 18 2014 also in february 2014 we completed an offering of 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes the notes do not bear regular interest but have an effective interest rate of 32 attributable to the conversion feature 

during 2013 we completed two acquisitions and in 2012 we completed four acquisitions although our financial statements include revenue and expenses of the acquired companies following their acquisitions the impact was not material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial results in the first quarter of 2013 we also divested our ads business 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue from 2013  to 2014  was driven by continued strong demand for our services across all of our major solutions and geographies in particular we experienced the addition of new customers increased sales of incremental services to our existing customers and amounts earned for traffic usage in excess of committed amounts as well as customerspecific onetime events in addition the acquisition of prolexic during the first quarter of 2014 contributed to increased revenue these contributions to higher revenue were partially offset by lost committed recurring revenue and price declines 

the increase in our revenue from 2012  to 2013  was also driven by increased demand for our services partially offset by the divestiture of ads in the first quarter of 2013 

for the year ended december 31 2014  resellers accounted for 25  of revenue as compared to 21  and 22  of revenue respectively for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012  for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of revenue 

effective in the first quarter of 2014 we elected to revise our method for determining the split of revenue derived from our operations located outside the us previously revenue was split based on our invoicing location and has been revised to reflect the location in which the sale originated prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the new method for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  approximately 27  of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the us no single country outside of the us accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods during 2014  we experienced strong revenue growth from our operations in the asia pacific region and continued improvement in revenue growth from our operations in europe the middle east and africa primarily driven by growth across all of our major solutions 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively  impacted our revenue by 78 million  during 2014  as compared to 2013  changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively  impacted our revenue by 150 million  during 2013  as compared to 2012  

during the first quarter of 2015 we elected to revise the presentation of our revenue solution categories primarily related to how we present productspecific services revenue historically productspecific services were classified as service and support solutions revenue beginning in the first quarter of 2015 productspecific services will be classified in their respective product solution categories 

the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue from our solution categories during the periods presented under our revised presentation in thousands 



the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue from our solution categories during the periods presented under our previous presentation in thousands 



the increases in media delivery solutions revenue for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  were due to strong demand across most of our customer base including from our largest most strategic customers during 2014  we experienced particularly strong growth from our social media gaming video and software download customers 

the increases in performance and security solutions revenue for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  were due to increases in demand from both new and existing customers particularly for our web performance and cloud security solutions additionally the increase for 2014 as compared to 2013 was partially attributable to the acquisition of prolexic 

the increases in the service and support solutions revenue for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  were due to increases in sales of our services and support offerings due to strong service attachment rates – increased purchases of professional services to support the integration and use of our core solutions – for both customers of our core media delivery and performance and security solutions we also experienced increases in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of eventdriven revenues as our customers relied on our service professionals to help them execute live media events 

the ads business was divested in the first quarter of 2013 which had a modest negative impact on 2014 and 2013 revenue as compared to 2012 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increase in total cost of revenue for 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to increases in 

 

the net decrease in cost of revenue for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to decreases in 

 

the net decrease for 2013 as compared to 2012 was partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs of service personnel due to headcount growth amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network and amortization of internaluse software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation services with various network and internet service providers our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for details regarding our bandwidth usage and colocation services purchase commitments 

we believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2015  as compared to 2014  we expect to deploy more servers and deliver more traffic on our network which will result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and additional colocation fees however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit and continued efficiency in network deployment additionally during 2015  we anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs as compared to 2014  to increase along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our network and professional services personnel and related expenses we plan to continue to make investments in our network in the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of continued growth in headcount to support investments in new product development partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization these development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31   2014 2013 and 2012  we capitalized 137 million  115 million  and 89 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives which is generally two years 

we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2015  as compared to 2014  as we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements to our core technology and support the development of new services and engineering innovation 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  were primarily due to higher payroll and related costs as we invested in our sales and marketing organization and to an increase in marketing programs and related costs in support of our gotomarket capacity and ongoing geographic expansion other expenses which consisted primarily of sales and marketing events and related travel expenses increased as we grew our sales and marketing organization 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2015  as compared to 2014  due to an expected increase in payroll and related costs as a result of anticipated continued headcount growth primarily with respect to our direct sales team and corporate marketing function 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  

general and administrative expenses include costs of our finance human resources information technology legal and administrative network infrastructure functions in addition to our facilityrelated costs and depreciation of facilityrelated capital assets the increases in general and administrative expenses for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  were primarily due to the expansion of company infrastructure to support investments in engineering gotomarket capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives in particular we increased general and administrative headcount and expanded our facility footprint which collectively increased payroll and related costs facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation and amortization in addition acquisitionrelated costs increased for 2014  as compared to 2013  due to the acquisition of prolexic conversely acquisitionrelated costs for 2013  as compared to 2012  decreased due to the acquisitions of cotendo inc blaze software inc fastsoft inc or fastsoft and verivue inc or verivue in 2012 with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013 

during 2015  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as compared to 2014  due to anticipated higher payroll and related costs and facilitiesrelated costs attributable to increased hiring investment in information technology and planned facility expansion 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2014  as compared to 2013  was due to the acquisition of prolexic the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2013  as compared to 2012  was due to the amortization of assets related to the acquisition of strategic network assets from att services inc and also a full year of amortization from the acquisitions occurring in 2012 which was partially offset by the writeoff of intangible assets recorded as part of the divestiture of ads in 2013 and the completion of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years 

based on acquired intangible assets at december 31 2014  future amortization is expected to be approximately 268 million  252 million  231 million  162 million  and 126 million  for the years ending december 31 2015  2016  2017  2018  and 2019  respectively the decrease in expected amortization is due to the finalization of amortization of acquired intangible assets acquired in earlier years in addition to the deceleration in recognition due to the pattern in which we amortize intangible assets 

restructuring charges 



the 2014 restructuring charges consisted of severance and related expenses as a result of the acquisition of prolexic in addition to a fee for a facility contract termination during 2013 we recorded a restructuring charge for leasehold improvements that were no longer in use as a result of an early lease termination in addition we incurred severance and relocation expenses for employees impacted by the closing of the facility in 2012 we recorded restructuring charges related to work force reductions in connection with the 2012 acquisitions of fastsoft and verivue we do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges as a result of any of these actions 

interest income 



interest income consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 

interest expense 



interest expense consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 

other expense income net 



other expense income net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred the fluctuation in other expense income net for 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions 

provision for income taxes 



for the year ended december 31 2014 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the federal research and development credit a state tax benefit from software development activities the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by state income taxes and the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments for the year ended december 31 2013 our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate mainly due to the retroactive adoption of the domestic production activities deduction the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit which included a onetime retroactive impact for fiscal 2012 and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by state income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012 our effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to state income tax expense and the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments partially offset by the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

the increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the same period in 2013  was mainly due to the increase in operating income and a change in the composition of projected income in different jurisdictions partially offset by the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit the federal domestic production activities deduction and state software development activities benefit the increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to the increase in operating income partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction the federal research and development credit and a change in the composition of projected income in different jurisdictions 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude expenses and gains that may be infrequent unusual in nature or otherwise not reflective of our ongoing operating results management also believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 

allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition therefore we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our nongaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre and postacquisition operating results 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap income from operations to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  in thousands 



the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  in thousands except per share data 



nongaap net income per diluted share is calculated as nongaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in nongaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of 6900 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 under gaap shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully diluted share calculation until they are delivered however we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share until our weighted average stock price is greater than 8956 the initial conversion price there will be no difference between our gaap and nongaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation restructuring charges acquisitionrelated costs certain gains and losses on investments benefit from adoption of software development activities gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt amortization of debt discount and issuance costs amortization of capitalized interest expense gains and losses on legal settlements and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue 

revenue from our international operations has historically been an important contributor to our total revenue consequently our revenue results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the information presented is calculated by translating current period results using the same average foreign currency exchange rates per month from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2014  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency securities totaled 16 billion  we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high quality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy is also designed to limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and advance goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to pursue acquisitions and other investments at opportune times we expect to continue to consider strategic investments intended to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis 

as of december 31 2014  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1443 million  held in accounts outside the us an immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to us federal taxation if repatriated with such tax liability partially offset by foreign tax credits the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us are subject to or offset by intercompany obligations to our parent company in the us and therefore are not subject to us federal taxation as a result we do not believe our liquidity is materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to 2013  and 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increased profitability and the resulting cash collections from customers offset by payments of working capital cash paid for income taxes also impacted cash flows provided by operating activities which were 1662 million  635 million  and 948 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2014 and 2012 we paid taxes related to our acquisitions which increased cash paid for taxes during those years in addition we changed the way we scheduled estimated us federal tax payments which caused cash paid for taxes to decrease during 2013 as compared to both 2014 and 2012 the increase in our profitability has also generally had the impact of increasing cash paid for income taxes during recent years 

we expect cash provided by operating activities to increase in 2015 due to an expected increase in cash collections related to anticipated higher revenue partially offset by an anticipated increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and commissions 

cash used in investing activities 



the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily relates to the acquisition of prolexic with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013 the increase also relates to the increase in net purchases of marketable securities as a result of the investment of the proceeds of our convertible senior notes issuance additionally expenditures for internaluse software increased as we continued to invest in our network with the goal of enhancing and adding functionality to our service offerings 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily related to the four acquisitions we completed in 2012 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013 the decrease also relates to the timing of purchases and sales of marketable securities offset by an increase in our capital expenditures 

cash provided by used in financing activities 



cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily the result of the convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 and related note hedge and warrant transactions concurrently with the convertible senior notes issuance we also repurchased 620 million of our common stock which contributed to the increase in repurchases of common stock as compared to 2013 

the increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 2012 was the result of an increase in repurchases of our common stock partially offset by an increase in proceeds received from our stockbased compensation plans 

in october 2013  the board of directors authorized a 7500 million  share repurchase program effective from october 16 2013 through december 31 2016 the goal of the program is to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  we repurchased 46 million  39 million  and 44 million  shares of our common stock respectively at an average price per share of 5802  4116  and 3245  respectively pursuant to the current repurchase program as well as prior programs approved by the board of directors 

repurchases under the share repurchase program will be executed in the open market subject to rule 10b18 promulgated under the exchange act subject to applicable securities laws requirements we may choose to suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time any purchases made under the program will be reflected as an increase in cash used in financing activities 

convertible senior notes 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases in addition to the 620 million in repurchases discussed above working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

liquidity outlook 

we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months our foreseeable cash needs include our planned capital expenditures salaries related to increased hiring investments in information technology and facility expansion as well as anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other longterm liabilities 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2014  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2014  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  411 million  including  77 million  of accrued interest and penalties we believe it is reasonably possible 43 million of our unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2015 as a result of ongoing audits the settlement period for the remaining amount is unknown 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding 83 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect in some cases until january 2024  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

legal matters 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

we are conducting an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel relating to sales practices in a country outside the us that represented less than 1 of our revenue in each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 the internal investigation includes a review of compliance with the requirements of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws and regulations by employees in that market in february 2015 we voluntarily contacted the us securities and exchange commission and department of justice to advise both agencies of this internal investigation as of the filing of this annual report on form 10k we cannot predict the outcome of this matter no provision with respect to this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued updated guidance and disclosure requirements for recognizing revenue the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this guidance will be effective for us on january 1 2017 and may be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new accounting guidance 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum of monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for contracts with a monthly commitment we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services – the delivery of content applications and software over the internet – as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services these elements have value to our customers on a standalone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor generally there is no right of return relative to these services 

we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements all standalone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average standalone selling price for those services for our core services the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately 

for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe third party evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we estimate besp based upon a managementapproved price list and preestablished discount levels for each solution that takes into consideration volume geography and industry lines we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

effective january 1 2013 we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets primarily servers from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently this change was recorded prospectively and decreased depreciation expense on network assets by approximately 211 million  and 457 million  and increased net income by approximately 155 million  and 336 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the change also increased both basic and diluted net income per share by 009  for the year ended december 31 2014 and 019  and 018  respectively for the years ended december 31 2013 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2014 and 2013  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

  

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names noncompete agreements and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements using a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs including stockbased compensation of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including government agency obligations corporate bonds and money market funds investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased net revenue and operating expenses conversely our net revenue and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transaction exposure 

we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our statements of operations within other expense income net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were immaterial during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  

translation exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheets these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity which is reflected in our balance sheets under accumulated other comprehensive loss 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers as of december 31 2014 no customers had an account receivable balance greater than 10 of our accounts receivable as of december 31 2013 one customer had an account receivable balance greater than 10 of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2014 concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was not significant

making the cloud work for our customers 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other enterprises conduct business and reach the public enterprises want to offer a dynamic consistent secure experience for millions of end users and to take advantage of the potential cost savings of cloud computing – using third party server facilities to enable internet operations the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of todays communication demands or the dramatic expansion in the number and types of devices individuals use to access it the ad hoc architecture presents potential problems for its widespread usage today such as 

 

these potential problems intersect with the features of what we call the hyperconnected world including 

 

achieving an enterprises goals in the face of these challenges is made more difficult by internal technology issues driven by competition globalization and expensecontainment strategies companies need an agile cloudbased infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives the dramatic increase in internet usage places extensive demands on infrastructure however expanding internal systems to meet routine demand can be costprohibitive keeping pace with new developments can also be a difficult challenge special marketing or promotional initiatives or unanticipated onetime events such as important unanticipated news may draw millions of additional visitors to a companys website over a brief period of time putting in place incremental internal infrastructure to deal with such spikes is usually impractical and expensive network operators themselves are challenged to profitably manage consumer access to the internet over their networks recouping the costs of the infrastructure buildouts they need to make is generally not supported by their traditional business models 

akamai offers solutions to assist enterprises and network operators in meeting their goals in spite of the challenges at the intersection of the internet and the hyperconnected world in particular our services are designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises improve the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations for network operators we have developed solutions designed to enable them to leverage akamais technology – and its potential benefits – within their own networks to sell content delivery solutions to enterprises and federate with akamais network

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions for internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry by providing alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology as of december 31 2013 we owned or had exclusive rights to 208 issued us patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries we also have numerous additional us and foreign country patent applications pending our usissued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2032 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had 3908  fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good 




 item 1a    risk factors 

the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

we face intense competition the consequences of which could adversely affect our business 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing our current and potential competitors vary by size service offerings and geographic region and range from start ups that offer solutions competing with a discrete part of our business to large technology or telecommunications companies that offer or may be planning to introduce products and services that are broadly competitive with what we do the primary competitive factors in our market are excellence of technology global presence customer service technical expertise security easeofuse breadth of services offered price and financial strength 

many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources larger customer bases longer operating histories greater brand recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do as a result some of these competitors may be able to 

 ▪ adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly 

 

smaller and more nimble competitors may be able to 

 

existing significant customers have in the past and others may in the future reduce or eliminate their purchases of our services because they 

 

these approaches which may also be pursued by potential customers also mean that our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts our results could be harmed 

due to the pace of change and innovation in our business and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if revenue from new customers or renewals by existing customers falls short of our expectations many of our expenses are also fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time such as with colocation and bandwidth providers so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early as a result we expect that our revenues operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our revenues operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

the development of new services and enhancements to existing services are key to our revenue growth if we fail to innovate effectively and adequately respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions we believe that developing innovative solutions is key to our revenue growth we must do so in an environment where other competitors may develop products and services that are or may be viewed as better than ours failure to adequately develop new solutions that are attractive to customers may significantly impair our revenue growth 

the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources in that case we could see significant growth in expenses without any corresponding revenue increases 

numerous factors could cause our revenue growth rate and profitability to decline 

our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition pricing pressure the decline in growth rate percentages as our revenues increase to higher levels and macroeconomic factors affecting certain aspects of our business we also believe our profitability may decrease because we have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth colocation and other expenses including increased depreciation on network equipment purchased in recent years as a result we may not be able to continue to maintain our current level of profitability in 2014 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 

we may be unable to replace lost revenues due to customer cancellations or renewals at lower rates 

our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their existing terms which are typically 12 to 24 months we cannot predict our renewal rates some may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths historically a significant percentage of our renewals particularly with larger customers have involved unit price declines as competition has increased and the market for certain parts of our business has matured if that trend continues in the future we will need to sell more services or attract new customers to increase our revenues and improve or maintain profitability our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors including competitive pressures customer dissatisfaction with our services customers inability to continue their operations and spending levels the impact of dual vendor policies customers implementing or increasing their use of inhouse technology solutions and general economic conditions it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers and increasing the number of highmargin services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase if we are unable to do so our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

we may be unsuccessful at developing strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenues which could significantly limit our longterm growth 

our future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators product makers and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenues the need to develop such relationships can be particularly acute in areas outside of the united states we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force a past lack of strategic focus on such arrangements and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channels those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number and quality of relationships with channel partners and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

as part of our business strategy we have entered and may seek to enter into business combinations acquisitions and other strategic relationships that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 

we have completed numerous acquisitions in recent years if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases we may also enter into other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 

any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with a future acquisition or combination if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

if we fail to manage effectively our operations expected growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals 

we have greatly increased our employee base in recent years and have brought in hundreds of new employees through acquisitions it is important to our continued success that we hire qualified employees properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful at these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become 

increasingly complex in the recent past due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to manage our technical support infrastructure effectively and improve our sales efficiency we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems ordering processes and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support operations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures which could harm our profitability we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

our corporate culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture we could lose the innovation creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture and our operating results may be harmed 

we believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture which we believe fosters innovation creativity and teamwork if we implement more complex organizational management structures because of growth or other structural changes or create disparities in personal wealth among our employees through our compensation philosophy and benefit plan utilization we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture if we cannot maintain a favorable corporate culture then we can lose employee engagement which can cause employees to lose the desire to innovate foster teamwork and provide extraordinary assistance to our customers which could negatively impact our future operating results 

defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our solutions and subject us to substantial liability 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our services and platform we have also experienced customer dissatisfaction with the quality of some of our media delivery services which has led to loss of business and could lead to loss of customers in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner and we may have insufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession as we acquire companies we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent 

with our brand and reputation if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified and improve the quality of our services or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses delayed payments and legal actions by our customers if we elect to move into new areas that involve legal and regulatory complexities the potential risks we face and magnitude of losses could increase 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services or attacks on our internal information technology systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard affected customers may be entitled to credits our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our third party network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses human error and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users 

our increased focus on selling securityrelated solutions could increase the number and intensity of attacks against our systems 

as we expand our emphasis on selling securityrelated solutions we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure the risks associated with which are described in more details below the acquisition of prolexic in particular is expected to increase our visibility as a securityfocused company security risks for us will also increase as we continue to grow our cloudbased offerings and services especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services and the government 

cybersecurity attacks and other security breaches could expose us to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we are in the information technology business and our services and network transmit and store our customers information and data as well as our own we have a reputation for a secure and reliable platform and services and have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our services and internal and external data that we manage nevertheless there have been and in the future are likely to be attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems in order to steal information about our technology financial data or other information or take other actions that would be damaging to our customers and us such attacks may be pursued through viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our platform exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers data or our it systems we have acquired a number of companies over the years and may continue to do so in the future while we make significant efforts to address any it security issues with respect to our acquisitions we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within akamai 

there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our security measures will be effective that we will quickly detect an attack or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation any insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to cover all or a significant portion of the losses we could suffer from an attack any breach of the security of our information systems could lead to the unauthorized release of valuable confidential information including trade secrets material nonpublic information about our customers personally identifiable information about individuals financial information and sensitive data that others could use to compete against us such events could likely harm our business and reputation if the security solutions we offer to address the internet security needs of our customers fail to operate effectively or to provide benefits promised by us we could suffer from reduced revenues and harm to our business and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in disruptions to our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become 

unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business networks imposing traffic limits or governments adopting regulations that impact network operations in some regions network providers may choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices any failure of network providers on which we rely to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or disruption to service to our customers and ultimately loss of those customers in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our profitability 

the potential exhaustion of the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses and the inability of akamai and other internet users to successfully transition to ipv6 could harm our operations and the functioning of the internet as a whole 

an internet protocol address or ip address is a numerical label that is assigned to any device connecting to the internet today the functioning of the internet is dependent on the use of internet protocol version 4 or ipv4 the fourth version of the internet protocol which uses 32bit addresses we currently rely on the acquisition of ip addresses for the functioning and expansion of our network and expect such reliance to continue in the future there are however only a finite number of ipv4 addresses the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses is likely to be exhausted in the near future internet protocol version 6 or ipv6 uses 128bit addresses and has been designed to succeed ipv4 and alleviate the expected exhaustion of unallocated addresses under that version while ipv4 and ipv6 will coexist for some period of time eventually all internet users and companies will need to transition to ipv6 there can be no guarantee that the plans we have been developing for the transition to ipv6 will be effective if we are unable to obtain the ipv4 addresses we need on financial terms acceptable to us or at all before we or other entities that rely on the internet can transition to ipv6 our current and future operations could be materially harmed if there is not a timely and successful transition to ipv6 by internet users generally the internet could function less effectively which could damage numerous businesses the economy generally and the prospects for future growth of the internet as a medium for transacting business this could in turn be harmful to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

furthermore our revenues particularly those attributable to usage of our services beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media customers and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our services as we introduce new services and potentially increase software licensing we expect to face additional challenges with our forecasting processes also because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance or make changes in our guidance with respect to future operating results our stock price may decrease significantly in reaction 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of march 3 2014 we had total longterm debt of 6900 million of convertible senior notes our ability to refinance the notes make cash payments in connection with conversions of the notes or repurchase those notes in the event of a fundamental change will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control we also may not use the cash we have raised through the issuance of the convertible senior notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would be dilutive to existing stockholders if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the notes which could seriously harm our business in addition the terms of the notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations the loss of the services of any of our key employees could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability entities holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming akamai could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if it is alleged that our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable developments and changes in patent law such as changes in interpretations of the joint infringement standard could also restrict how we enforce certain patents we hold monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from mit technology that is covered by various patents and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business these patents are scheduled to expire over the next five years 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of the software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear we periodically review our compliance with the opensource licenses we use and do not believe we will be required to make our proprietary software freely available however if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost 

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

significant portions of our business depend on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats if our legal right or technical ability to store and deliver content in one or more popular proprietary content formats such as adobe ®  flash ®  or windows ®  media were to become limited our ability to serve our customers in these formats would be impaired and the demand for our content delivery services would decline by customers using these formats owners of proprietary content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software investments 

contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates and reserves are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business accordingly this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes and if we expand through acquisitions of other companies our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

a portion of our revenues is derived from international operations revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate transactional exposures there is no guarantee that such program will be fully effective 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent copyright protection tax consumer protection cybersecurity content antidiscrimination and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours other potential regulatory proposals could seek to mandate changes to the economic relationships among participants in the internet ecosystem the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services in addition domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet through legislation treaties or regulations could negatively impact our business 

changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with potentially varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors may join to limit the revenues we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts generally have requirements that are more complex that those found in commercial enterprise agreements and therefore more costly to comply with such contracts are also subject to audits and investigations that could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor in economies outside the us and could continue to have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

global climate change regulations could adversely impact our business 

recent scientific studies and other news reports suggest the possibility of global climate change in response governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business our deployed network of more than 140000 servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels it is possible that future regulatory or legislative initiatives or customer demands could affect the costs of operating our network of servers and our other operations such costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenues and damage to our reputation 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

overview 

we primarily derive income from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer we believe that this emphasis on longerterm contracts generally allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of 

revenue which is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by minimizing customer cancellations or terminations and limiting the impact of price reductions reflected in contract renewals and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number and quality of services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of the quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

our revenue is impacted by a number of factors including our ability to maintain our base of committed recurring revenues the timing and variability of customerspecific onetime events prices we are able to charge for our services the amount of traffic we serve on our network and the impact of seasonal variations on our business we have observed the following trends related to our revenue during 2013  

 

 

 

 

our profitability is also impacted by our expense levels including direct costs to support our revenue such as colocation and bandwidth costs and expenses incurred to support strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate revenue in the future we observed the following trends during 2013  and discuss our expectations related to our cost of revenue and operating expenses 

 

 

 

 

during 2013 we completed two acquisitions and in 2012 we completed four acquisitions the acquisitions were not material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial results in december 2013 we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire prolexic for approximately 3900 million in cash and the assumption of unvested options subject to postclosing adjustments the acquisition closed in february 2014 prolexic has approximately 200 employees and the acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to our earnings per share 

results of operations 

the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated   



revenue 

revenue during the periods presented is as follows in thousands 



the increase in our revenue from 2012 to 2013 was driven by continued strong demand for our services the increase was attributable to the addition of new customers increased sales of incremental services to our existing customers and amounts earned for traffic usage in excess of committed amounts and customerspecific onetime events these contributions to higher revenue were partially offset by lost committed recurring revenue price declines and the divestiture of ads 

the increase in our revenue from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers leading to increased purchases of our solutions by our customers additionally our growth rate in 2012 benefited from revenues from our acquisitions in 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2013 resellers accounted for 21  of revenue as compared to 22  and 19  of revenue respectively for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of revenue 

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 29  28  and 29  respectively of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states no single country outside of the united states accounted for 10 or more of revenue during any of these periods during 2013  we continued to see strong growth from our operations in the asia pacific region and our operations in europe the middle east and africa performed well despite continued macroeconomic factors 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively  impacted our revenue by 150 million  during fiscal year 2013  as compared to 2012  

the following table quantifies the contribution to revenue during the periods presented from our solution categories in thousands 



the increases in media delivery solutions revenue for 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012  as compared to 2011  were due to increased consumption of our customers online media offerings and higher software download volumes during 2013  we experienced strong growth in usage by some of our largest most strategic accounts driven by increased software downloads gaming video delivery and social media consumption all of which contributed to our yearoveryear revenue growth these increases were partially offset by a large media customer finalizing the removal of its video content from our platform during 2013  resulting in loss of revenue as compared to 2012  

the increases in performance and security solutions revenue for 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012  as compared to 2011  were due to increases in demand for our performance and security solutions from both new and existing customers during 2013 we experienced strong demand for our website and application acceleration solutions as well as our security offerings 

the increases in the service and support solutions revenue for 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012  as compared to 2011  were due to increases in sales of our services and support offerings due to strong service attachment rates for both customers of our core media delivery and performance and security solutions 

the advertising decision solutions business was divested in the first quarter of 2013 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



in recent years we have continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit colocation fees and other networkrelated expenses which has had the impact of decreasing cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue 

this net decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreases in 

 

these decreases were partially offset by increases in 

 

cost of revenue increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth due to higher traffic levels the increases were partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internaluse software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure 

cost of revenue for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  also included credits received of approximately 91 million  108 million  and 69 million  respectively from billing settlements and renegotiations related to bandwidth contracts 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation services with various network and internet service providers see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

we believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2014  as compared to 2013  we expect to deploy more servers and deliver more traffic on our network which will result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and additional colocation fees however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit and continued efficiency in network deployment additionally during 2014  we anticipate amortization of internaluse software development costs as comparted to 2013 to increase along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our network and professional services personnel and related expenses we plan to continue to make investments in our network in the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

we have revised cost of revenue reported in 2012 and 2011 in the table above as a result of a reevaluation of our business model costs that were previously classified as sales and marketing and general and administrative are now classified as cost of revenue see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information and amounts revised 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in research and development expenses for 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012  as compared to 2011  were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of continued growth in headcount to invest in new product development partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs 

research and development costs are expensed as incurred other than certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization these development costs consist of external consulting expenses and payroll and related costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the years ended december 31   2013 2012 and 2011  we capitalized 115 million  89 million  and 71 million  respectively of stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives of two years 

we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2014  as compared to 2013  as we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements to our core technology and support the development of new services and engineering innovation 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 



the increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012  as compared to 2011  were primarily due to higher payroll and related costs including commissions for sales and support personnel and stockbased compensation we increased hiring in our sales organization in support of our gotomarket capacity and ongoing geographic expansion which contributed to the increases other expenses which consists primarily of sales and marketing events and related travel expenses increased as we supported our revenue goals 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2014  as compared to 2013  due to an expected increase in payroll and related costs as a result of anticipated continued headcount growth in our sales and marketing organization 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented in thousands 

  

general and administrative expenses include costs of our finance human resources information technology legal and administrative network infrastructure functions in addition to our facilityrelated costs and deprecation of facilityrelated capital assets the increases in general and administrative expenses for 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012  as compared to 2011  were primarily due to the expansion of company infrastructure to support investments in engineering network scaling and gotomarket capacity specifically we had increases to headcount external consulting support and our facility footprint these actions increased payroll and related costs network procurement costs facilitiesrelated costs and depreciation during 2013  as compared to 2012  and 2012 as compared to 2011  

during 2014  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as compared to 2013  due to anticipated higher payroll and related costs and facilitiesrelated costs attributable to increased hiring investment in information technology network scaling and planned facility expansion 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 



the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2013 as compared to 2012  was due to the acquisition of strategic network assets from att services inc and also a full year of amortization from the acquisitions occurring throughout 2012 which was partially offset by the writeoff of intangible assets recorded as part of the divestiture of ads in 2013 and the completion of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2012  as compared to 2011  was due to the amortization of assets related to the acquisitions of blaze software inc or blaze cotendo inc or cotendo fastsoft inc or fastsoft and verivue inc or verivue during 2012 

based on acquired intangible assets at december 31 2013  future amortization was expected to be approximately 206 million  189 million  145 million  102 million  and 44 million  for the years ending december 31 2014  2015  2016  2017  and 2018  respectively we anticipate that these amortization amounts will increase in future periods as a result of our acquisition of prolexic which closed in february 2014 

restructuring charges 



during 2013 we recorded a restructuring charge for leasehold improvements that are no longer in use as a result of an early lease termination in addition we incurred severance and relocation expenses for employees impacted by the closing of the facility in 2012 we recorded restructuring charges related to work force reductions in connection with the 2012 acquisitions of fastsoft and verivue in 2011 we implemented a companywide workforce reduction and vacated excess facilities as a result we recorded severance and estimated future lease payments net of sublease income in 2011 we do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges as a result of these actions 

interest income net 



interest income net consists of interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 

other expense income net 



other expense income net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred and other nonoperating expense and income items the fluctuation in other expense income net for 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other nonfunctional currency transactions the fluctuation in other expense income net for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to a legal settlement received in 2011 other expense income net may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign exchange rates or other events 

provision for income taxes 



for the year ended december 31 2013  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the retroactive adoption of the domestic production activities deduction which resulted in a net tax benefit of 183 million for the period from january 1 2010 through december 31 2013 the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit at the beginning of 2013  which included a onetime retroactive impact for 2012  as well as the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the us for the year ended december 31 2012  our effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the effects of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sharebased payments and state income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2011  our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings partially offset by state income taxes 

the increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the same period in 2012  was mainly due to the increase in operating income partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction the federal research and development credit and a change in the composition of projected income in different jurisdictions 

our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes our effective income tax rate is also impacted by and may fluctuate in any given period because of the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or gaap we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap or nongaap financial measures management uses nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods for financial and operational decision making for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance these nongaap financial measures are nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as discussed below 

management believes that these nongaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business as they exclude expenses and gains that may be infrequent 

unusual in nature or otherwise not reflective of our ongoing operating results management also believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies 

the nongaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial results and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for our financial results presented in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap adjustments and our basis for excluding them from nongaap financial measures are outlined below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to nongaap net income and nongaap net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in thousands except per share data 



we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items interest income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation restructuring charges acquisitionrelated costs certain gains and losses on investments gains losses and other activity related to divestiture of a business foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt gains and losses on legal settlements and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in thousands 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue 

revenue from our international operations has historically represented a significant portion of our total revenue consequently our revenue results have been impacted and management expects they will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken our consolidated results stated in us dollars are negatively impacted 

because exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods the information presented is calculated by translating current period results using the same average foreign currency exchange rates per month from the comparative period 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations as of december 31 2013  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate bonds and us government agency securities totaled 12 billion  we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high quality credit standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenues accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to make the best investments at the most opportune times we continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis 

as of december 31 2013  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1123 million  held in accounts outside the us an immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to us federal taxation if repatriated with such tax liability partially offset by foreign tax credits the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us are subject to or offset by intercompany obligations to our parent company in the us and therefore are not subject to us federal taxation as a result our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the us 

cash provided by operating activities 



the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  was primarily due to increased profitability and the resulting cash collections from customers offset by payments to our vendors the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to increased profitability and the timing of collections from our customers we expect cash provided by operating activities to increase in 2014 due to an expected increase in cash collections related to anticipated higher revenues partially offset by an anticipated increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and commissions 

we have revised cash provided by operating activities reported in 2012 and 2011 in the table above to reflect immaterial cash flow classification errors identified in 2013 between operating investing and financing activities the same amounts have been revised in the cash used in investing and financing activities tables below see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information and amounts revised 

cash used in provided by investing activities 



the decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily relates to the acquisitions of blaze cotendo fastsoft and verivue in 2012  with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013  the decrease also relates to the timing of purchases and sales of marketable securities offset by an increase in our capital expenditures 

the decrease in cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily relates to the acquisitions occurring in 2012 and the timing of purchases and sales of marketable securities in both periods 

cash used in financing activities 



the increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 2012  is the result of an increase in repurchases of our common stock partially offset by an increase in proceeds received from our stockbased compensation plans the decrease in cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily the result of a decrease in repurchases of our common stock during the years ended december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 we repurchased 39 million  44 million  and 123 million shares of common stock respectively at an average price per share of 4116  3245  and 2645 respectively 

in april 2012 the board of directors authorized a 1500 million stock repurchase program covering a twelvemonth period commencing on may 1 2012 in january 2013  the board of directors authorized a 1500 million  extension of our share repurchase program effective for a twelvemonth period beginning february 1 2013  in october 2013  the board of directors authorized a new 7500 million  share repurchase program effective from october 16 2013 through december 31 2016 unused amounts from the may 2012 program were not carried over to the program approved in january 2013  and unused amounts from the january 2013  program were not carried over to the october 2013  program the goal of the october 2013  share repurchase program is to both offset dilution from our equity compensation plans and to provide the flexibility to increase distributions to our shareholders as business and market conditions warrant 

repurchases under the october 2013 plan will be executed in the open market subject to rule 10b18 promulgated under the exchange act and may also be made under one or more rule 10b51 plans which would permit us to repurchase shares when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws subject to applicable securities laws requirements we may choose to suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time any purchases made under the program will be reflected as an increase in cash used in financing activities 

convertible senior notes 

in february 2014 we issued 6900 million par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions the terms of the notes hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k akamai intends to use the net 

proceeds of the offering for share repurchases working capital and general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

in february 2014 we used 620 million of the net proceeds from the convertible senior notes to repurchase 10 million shares of our common stock in accordance with the stock repurchase plan previously approved by our board of directors discussed above 

liquidity outlook 

we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances the net proceeds from the convertible senior notes issued in 2014 and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 24 months our foreseeable cash needs include our planned capital expenditures salaries related to increased hiring investments in information technology and facility expansion costs in addition to anticipated share repurchases lease and purchase commitments settlements of other longterm liabilities and the prolexic acquisition 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2013  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2013  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  306 million  which included  59 million  of accrued interest and penalties as of december 31 2013  we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately 32 million of our unrecognized tax benefits each of which are individually insignificant and include research and development credits and transfer pricing adjustments may be recognized by the end of 2014 as a result of ongoing audits 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2013  we had outstanding 68 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit which are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments above are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

litigation 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued guidance and disclosure requirements for reporting of comprehensive income amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the guidance requires that an entity provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes thereto significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2012 the adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2013 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of marketable securities capitalized internaluse software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets income tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum of monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for contracts with a monthly committment we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services – the delivery of content applications and software over the internet – as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services these elements have value to our customers on a standalone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor generally there is no right of return relative to these services 

we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements all standalone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average standalone selling price for those services for our core services the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately 

for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe third party evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we estimate besp based upon a managementapproved price list and preestablished discount levels for each solution that takes into consideration volume geography and industry lines we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company can access at the reporting date fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

effective january 1 2013 we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets primarily servers from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently this change was recorded prospectively and decreased depreciation expense on network assets by approximately 457 million and increased net income by approximately 336 million for the year ended december 31 2013  the change also increased basic and diluted net income per share by 019 and 018 respectively for the year ended december 31 2013  

goodwill and acquired intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2013 and 2012  and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date 

acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and trade names and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation 

specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 

income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 

for stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units that contain only a servicebased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards vesting period for awards with a performance conditionbased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting period commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize salaries and related costs as well as stockbased compensation expense of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software development projects capitalization begins during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage has been completed if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the 

software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is available for general release capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internaluse software for impairment changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including government agency obligations corporate bonds and money market funds investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses conversely our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transaction exposure 

we enter into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in our statements of operations within other expense income net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were determined to be immaterial during the year ended december 31 2013  

translation exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity which is reflected in our balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive loss 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers as of december 31 2013 and 2012  one customer had an account receivable balance greater than 10 of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2013  concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was not significant

making the cloud work for our customers 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other enterprises conduct business and reach the public enterprises want to offer a dynamic consistent secure experience for millions of end users and to take advantage of the potential cost savings of cloud computing  using third party server facilities to enable internet operations the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of todays communication demands or the dramatic expansion in the number and types of devices individuals use to access it the ad hoc architecture presents potential problems for its widespread usage today such as 

 these potential problems intersect with the features of what we call the hyperconnected world including 

 2 

the resulting individual experience can be a disappointing one 

achieving an enterprises goals in the face of these challenges is made more difficult by internal technology issues driven by competition globalization and expensecontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives the dramatic increase in internet usage places extensive demands on infrastructure however expanding internal systems to meet routine demand can be costprohibitive keeping pace with new developments can also be a difficult challenge special marketing or promotional initiatives or unanticipated onetime events such as important unanticipated news may draw millions of additional visitors to a companys website over a brief period of time putting in place incremental internal infrastructure to deal with such spikes is usually impractical and expensive network operators themselves are challenged to profitably manage consumer access to the internet over their networks recouping the costs of the infrastructure build outs they need to make is generally not supported by their traditional business models

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 we compete with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services security solutions technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and value 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content and application delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2025 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had 3074 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

we face intense competition the consequences of which could adversely affect our business 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing the competitive landscape is varied and presents numerous different challenges including 

 ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially impact our business profitability financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we depend on the development of new services and enhancement to existing services if we fail to innovate and respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions our ability to provide new and innovative solutions to address the evolving ways enterprises use the internet is important to our future growth and profitability if we fail to do so our operating results will likely be significantly harmed if other companies develop technological or business model innovations in the markets we seek to address that are or are perceived to be equivalent or superior to our services then we could lose market share and our revenue and profitability would also suffer in addition our customers business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and the failure to address these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers needs for our services the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not successfully execute our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical or operational hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources 

numerous factors could cause our revenue growth rate and profitability to decline 

our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition pricing pressure the decline in growth rate percentages as our revenues increase to higher levels and macroeconomic factors affecting certain aspects of our business we also believe our profitability may decrease because we have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth colocation and other expenses including increased depreciation on network equipment purchased in recent years as a result we may not be able to continue to maintain our current level of profitability in 2013 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 8 

 

we are increasing our investment in engineering sales service and marketing activities these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

we are increasing our investment in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we focus on innovation and expansion of our operations particularly in areas such as cloud computing and security solutions we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

we may be unable to replace lost revenues due to customer cancellations or renewals at lower rates 

our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their existing terms which are typically 12 to 24 months we cannot predict our renewal rates some may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths historically a significant percentage of our renewals particularly with larger customers have involved unit price declines as competition has increased and the market for certain parts of our business has matured if that trend continues in the future we will need to sell more services or attract new customers to increase our revenues and improve or maintain profitability our renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors including competitive pressures customer dissatisfaction with our service customers inability to continue their operations and spending levels the impact of dual vendor policies customers implementing or increasing their use of inhouse technology solutions and general economic conditions it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase if we are unable to do so our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

we may be unable to develop robust strategic relationships with third parties that expand our distribution channels and increase revenues such failure could significantly limit our longterm growth 

our future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators and other strategic partners and to leverage those relationships to expand our distribution channels and increase revenues the need to develop such relationship can be particularly acute in areas outside of the united states we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force a past lack of strategic focus on such arrangements and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services require significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our portfolio of solutions as well as the systems processes and procedures that support our channel those systems processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number of relationships with channel partners  and any inability to successfully execute on the partnerships we initiate  could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

our failure to manage effectively our operations expected growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations we hired a new chief executive officer effective january 1 2013 and he has made and may want to make further changes to our strategic plan service offerings organizational structure or other aspects of the company these initiatives may not work as intended or may take longer to be effective which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and growth projections 

as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth enhance succession planning and decentralize our decisionmaking at a pace commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals 

we have greatly increased our employee base in recent years we expect that by the end of 2013 more than 50 of our employee population will have been at akamai for fewer than two years it is important to our continued success that we hire 

qualified employees properly train them and manage out poorlyperforming personnel all while maintaining our corporate culture and spirit of innovation if we are not successful at these efforts our growth and operations could be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to manage our technical support infrastructure effectively we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely efficient and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in the software that underlies our services and platform in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our operations we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers if we elect to move into new areas that involve handling personally identifiable information or other important assets or transactions entrusted to us by our customers the potential risks we face and magnitude of losses could increase 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services or attacks on our internal information technology systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial statements and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard affected customers may be entitled to credits our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users 

cybersecurity attacks and other security breaches could expose us to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

we are in the information technology business and our services and network transmit and store our customers information and data as well as our own we have a reputation for a secure and reliable platform and services and have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our services and internal and external data that we manage nevertheless there have been and in the future are likely to be attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems in order to steal information about our technology financial data or other information or take other actions that would be damaging to our customers and us such attacks may be pursued through viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our platform exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers data or our it systems 

as we expand our emphasis on selling securityrelated solutions we may become a more attractive target for attacks on our infrastructure security risks for us will also increase as we continue to grow our cloudbased offerings and services especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services and the government we have acquired a number of companies over the years and may continue to do so in the future while we make significant efforts to address any it security issues with respect to our acquisitions we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within akamai 

there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our security measures will be effective that we will quickly detect an attack or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation any insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to cover all or a significant portion of the losses we could suffer from an attack any breach of the security of our information systems could lead to the unauthorized release of valuable confidential information including trade secrets material nonpublic information about our customers personally identifiable information about individuals financial information and sensitive data that others could use to compete against us such events 

could likely harm our business and reputation if the security solutions we offer to address the internet security needs of our customers fail to operate effectively or to provide benefits promised by us we could suffer from reduced revenues and harm to our business and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes network providers going out of business or networks imposing traffic limits in some regions network providers may choose to compete with us and become unwilling to sell us adequate transmission capacity at fair market prices any failure of network providers on which we rely to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers and ultimately loss of those customers in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our profitability 

the potential exhaustion of the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses and the inability of akamai and other internet users to successfully transition to ipv6 could harm our operations and the functioning of the internet as a whole 

an internet protocol address or ip address is a numerical label that is assigned to any device connecting to the internet today the functioning of the internet is dependent on the use of internet protocol version 4 or ipv4 the fourth version of the internet protocol which uses 32bit addresses we currently rely on the acquisition of ip addresses for the functioning and expansion of our network and expect such reliance to continue in the future there are however only a finite number of ipv4 addresses the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses is likely to be exhausted in the near future internet protocol version 6 or ipv6 uses 128bit addresses and has been designed to succeed ipv4 and alleviate the expected exhaustion of unallocated addresses under that version while ipv4 and ipv6 will coexist for some period of time eventually all internet users and companies will need to transition to ipv6 there can be no guarantee that the plans we have been developing for the transition to ipv6 will be effective if we are unable to obtain the ipv4 addresses we need on financial terms acceptable to us or at all before we or other entities that rely on the internet can transition to ipv6 our current and future operations could be materially harmed if there is not a timely and successful transition to ipv6 by internet users generally the internet could function less effectively which could damage numerous businesses the economy generally and the prospects for future growth of the internet as a medium for transacting business this could in turn be harmful to our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we have entered and may seek to enter into business combinations acquisitions and other strategic relationships that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 

we have completed numerous acquisitions in recent years if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases we may also enter into other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the following 

 any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with a future acquisition or combination if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment could lose value 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 furthermore our revenues particularly those attributable to usage of our services beyond customer commitments can be difficult to forecast and as a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially this concern is particularly acute with respect to our media customers and commerce customers for which holiday sales are a key but unpredictable driver of usage of our services as we introduce new services and potentially increase software licensing we expect to face additional challenges with our forecasting processes also because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability if we announce revenue or profitability results that do not meet or exceed our guidance our stock price may decrease significantly in reaction 

any of these events as well as other circumstances discussed in these risk factors may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term members of our senior management team have left akamai over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations we compensate our officers and employees in part through equity incentives including stock options some of these stock options held by our officers and employees have exercise prices in excess of the current market price of our common stock which has diminished the retentive value of such options the loss of the services of any of our key employees could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming akamai could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 12 

 if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believed were infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention from our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable developments and changes in patent law such as changes in interpretations of the joint infringement standard could also restrict how we enforce certain patents we hold monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from the massachusetts institute of technology or mit technology that is covered by various patents and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such software to make any derivative works of such software available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or taking other actions that could divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear we periodically review our compliance with the opensource licenses we use and do not believe we will be required to make our proprietary software freely available however if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost 

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

significant portions of our business depend on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats if our legal right or technical ability to store and deliver content in one or more popular proprietary content formats such as adobe ®  flash ®  or windows ®  media were to become limited our ability to serve our customers in these formats would be impaired and the demand for our content delivery services would decline by customers using these formats owners of proprietary content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates and reserves are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of december 31 2012 we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business accordingly this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes and if we expand through acquisitions of other companies our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance results of operations and cash flows 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor worldwide economy has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows if the us government fails to reach a budget compromise in 2013 automatic spending cuts and tax increases could impact the economy and the businesses of our customers in addition the current sovereign debt crisis concerning certain european countries including greece italy ireland portugal and spain and related european financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of european currencies including the euro to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of european customers which could limit the amount of services they purchase from us to the extent economic conditions impair our customers ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss a slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

a portion of our revenues is derived from international operations revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar 

financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonfunctional currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program there is no guarantee that such program will be fully effective 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures which could harm our profitability we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous rapidlychanging and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies 

changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with potentially varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent copyright protection tax consumer protection content antidiscrimination and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours other potential regulatory 

proposals could seek to mandate changes to the economic relationships among participants in the internet ecosystem the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services in addition domestic and foreign government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet through legislation treaties or regulations could negatively impact our business 

global climate change regulations could adversely impact our business 

recent scientific studies and other news reports suggest the possibility of global climate change in response governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business our deployed network of tens of thousands of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels it is possible that future regulatory or legislative initiatives or customer demands could affect the costs of operating our network of servers and our other operations such costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenues and damage to our reputation 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government as well as foreign state and local governments and their respective agencies such government entities often have the right to terminate these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts if the us government fails to reach a budget compromise in 2013 automatic spending cuts could reduce the budgets of agencies that buy our services these factors may join to limit the revenues we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

we provide content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum alternatively many of our customer contracts have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly annual or longer periods having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services and features that our existing customers purchase at the same time we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

recent event 

effective january 1 2013 f thomson leighton became our new chief executive officer dr leighton cofounded akamai and has served as our chief scientist and as a director since august 1998 

on january 24 2013 we announced the acquisition by mediamath inc of substantially all of the assets used by us in our advertising decision solutions business simultaneously with the sale we entered into a multiyear relationship agreement whereby mediamath will have exclusive rights to leverage our pixelfree technology for use within digital advertising and marketing applications 

on february 6 2013 we announced that our board of directors authorized a 150 million extension of its share repurchase program effective for a 12month period beginning february 1 2013 as of this date all prior repurchase authorizations have expired 

overview of financial results 

we increased our net income in 2012  to dollar levels that exceeded both 2011  and 2010  the improvement primarily resulted from our efforts to increase our recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support that growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated   



we were profitable for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010  however we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future

based on our analysis of among other things the aforementioned trends and events as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2013  however our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our ability to 

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives in any future period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities capitalized internaluse software costs goodwill and other intangible assets tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue 

from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services  the delivery of content applications and software over the internet  as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services these elements have value to our customer on a standalone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor additionally there is not generally a right of return relative to these services 

we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements all standalone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average standalone selling price for those services for our core services the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately 

for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe thirdparty evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we estimate besp based upon a managementapproved product price list and preestablished discount levels for each product that takes into consideration volume geography and industry lines we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably 

assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as of december 31 2012 and 2011  we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of each of december 31 2012 and 2011  we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of those dates and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

loss contingencies 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose the nature of material loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

tax reserves 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement as of december 31 2012  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  269 million  including accrued interest and penalties 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options rsus and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock options that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 

for stock options rsus and deferred stock units that contain only a servicebased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards vesting period for awards with a performance conditionbased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting period commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs as well as stockbased compensation expense of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

results of operations 

revenues  total revenues increased 19  or 2154 million  to 13739 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 11585 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  total revenues increased 13  or 1350 million  to 11585 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 10236 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the following table quantifies the increase in revenues attributable to the different industry verticals in which we sell our services in millions 



we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years we expect this trend to continue in 2013  but our revenue may increase at a lower rate due to competitive factors general economic conditions and the impact of the sale of our advertising decisions solutions or ads business in early 2013 our growth rate in 2012 benefited from revenues from acquisitions we may not experience such benefits in 2013 

revenues from our media and entertainment vertical increased due to traffic growth stemming from increased online media consumption revenues from our commerce and enterprise verticals for 2012  as compared to 2011  as well as 2011  as compared to 2010  increased due to growth in application and cloud performance solutions particularly securityrelated solutions sold to customers in these verticals revenues from our high tech vertical increased in 2012  as compared to 2011  due to increased demand for cloud performance solutions and higher software download volumes revenues from the public sector increased in 2012  as compared to 2011  due to the timing of completion of certain elements of government agency contracts our 2011  revenues from the public sector and high tech verticals did not materially change as compared to 2010  

for 2012 2011 and 2010  28  29  and 28  respectively of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the united states revenue from our operations in europe represented 17  18  and 17  of total revenues for 2012 2011 and 2010  respectively other than the united states no single country accounted for 10  or more of our total revenues during these periods we expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in 2013 to remain consistent as compared to 2012 

resellers accounted for 22  of total revenues in 2012  19  in 2011  and 18  in 2010  approximately 1 of the increase in 2012 was attributable to a change in classification of certain direct customers to resellers for 2012 2011 and 2010  no single customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenues 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions 



cost of revenues increased 15  or 574 million  to 4319 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 3745 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  cost of revenues increased 23  or 711 million  to 3745 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 3034 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  

for each period this increase was primarily due to 

• an increase in amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth due to higher traffic levels partially offset by 

reduced bandwidth costs per unit and 

 

additionally in each of 2012 2011 and 2010  cost of revenues included stockbased compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation such expense increased by 07 million  in 2012  as compared to 2011  and decreased by 07 million  in 2011  as compared to 2010  cost of revenues during each of 2012 2011 and 2010  also included credits received of approximately 108 million  69 million  and 71 million  respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any are unpredictable 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers as of december 31 2012  our current minimum commitments for the years ending december 31 2013  2014  2015  2016  and 2017  were approximately 988 million  100 million  13 million  01 million  and  01 million  respectively 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2013  as compared to 2012  we expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally for 2013  we anticipate increases in amortization of internaluse software development costs  along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

due to the software and hardware initiatives we have undertaken to manage our global network more efficiently we expect the useful lives our of network assets to be extended by approximately one year this change is expected to decrease depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2013 as compared to 2012 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for research and development personnel who design develop test deploy and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  we capitalized software development costs of 506 million  404 million  and 311 million  respectively these development costs consisted of external consulting payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  we capitalized as internaluse software 89 million  71 million  and 76 million  respectively of noncash stockbased compensation net of impairments we amortize these capitalized internaluse software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

research and development expenses increased 43  or 224 million  to 747 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 523 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  research and development expenses decreased 4  or 24 million  to 523 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 548 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in research and development expenses in 2012  as compared to 2011  was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation as a result of headcount growth partially offset by capitalized salaries the decrease in research and development expenses in 2011  as compared to 2010  was due to higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stockbased compensation partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions 



we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2013  as compared to 2012  because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation expense commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and support functions and advertising and promotional expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased 34  or 771 million  to 3044 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2273 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  sales and marketing expenses increased 06 million  to 2273 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 2267 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2012  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs including commissions for sales and sales support personnel attributable to revenue growth an increase in stockbased compensation and higher marketing and related costs and other expenses the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2011  as compared to 2010  was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs including commissions for sales and sales support personnel attributable to revenue growth largely offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation marketing and related costs and other expenses 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 



we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2013  due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 general and administrative expenses increased 18  or 353 million  to 2270 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 1917 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  general and administrative expenses increased 14  or 239 million  to 1917 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 1678 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2012  as compared to 2011  was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth higher stockbased compensation expense costs related to the acquisitions of four companies in 2012 and an increase in the consulting advisory and other expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the legal fees and the provision for doubtful accounts the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2011  as compared to 2010  was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth an increase in facilitiesrelated costs and other expenses an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and an increase in legal fees these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation and nonincome tax expenses 

the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

  



we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased 23  or 39 million  to 210 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 171 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  amortization of other intangible assets increased 2  or  04 million  to 171 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to  167 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2012  as compared to 2011  was due to the completion of acquisitions of four companies in 2012 the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2011  as compared to 2010  was due to the acquisition of velocitude in june 2010 as of december 31 2012  we anticipate that amortization expense will be approximately 243 million  193 million  166 million  117 million  and 76 million  for the years ending december 31 2013  2014  2015  2016  and 2017  respectively 

restructuring charge we recorded a restructuring charge of  04 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  primarily in connection with workforce reductions related to the acquisitions of fastsoft and verivue during 2012 we recorded a restructuring charge of  49 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  primarily in connection with a workforce reduction we implemented in december 2011this charge included 42 million of employee severance benefits and 07 million of restructuring charges attributable to vacated facility leases we did not have any restructuring charges in 2010  our restructuring liabilities associated with employee severance benefits are expected to be fully paid in 2013 restructuring liabilities associated with facility leases will be fully paid through december 2019 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income decreased 40  or 43 million  to 64 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 107 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  interest income decreased 12  or 15 million  to 107 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 122 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the decreases in 2012  as compared to 2011  and in 2011  as compared to 2010  were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods 

interest expense interest expense includes interest that was paid on our former debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs during the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011  we had no outstanding interestbearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest and therefore had no interest expense during the year ended december 31 2010  we had 17 million of interest expense primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1 convertible senior notes during 2010 we converted into common stock an aggregate of 1998 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible note during that year 

other income expense net other income expense  net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred gains and losses from legal settlements and other nonoperating income expense items other income expense net decreased 55 million  to 06 million  of income for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 61 million  of income for the year ended december 31 2011  other income expense net increased 86 million  to 61 million  of income for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 25 million  of expense for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase in other income expense net for the period ended december 31 2012  as compared to the period ended december 31 2011  was primarily due 

to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany and other transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2011  consisted of foreign exchange losses and net funds received and paid as part of litigation settlements other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2010  consisted of foreign exchange losses other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings or other events 

gain loss on investments net during the year ended december 31 2012  we recorded a small net gain on investments of primarily related to the sale of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2011  we recorded a net loss on investments of 02 million   related to a writeoff of an equity investment and partially offset by gains from the sale of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2010  we recorded a net gain on investments of  04 million  primarily related to the sale of marketable securities additionally during 2010 we recorded a gain of 96 million due to a decrease in the otherthantemporary impaiment of certain auction rate securities or ars offset by a loss of 96 million on a put option related to our ars holdings 

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012  our effective tax rate of 366 was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stock based compensation partially offset by benefits recorded for state research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings for the year ended december 31 2011  our effective tax rate of 346 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings partially offset by state income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010  our effective tax rate of 347 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits partially offset by state income taxes provision for income taxes increased 11 or 113 million to 1176 million for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 1063 million for the year ended december 31 2011 provision for income taxes increased 17 or 151 million to 1063 million for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 912 million for the year ended december 31 2010  the increase from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in operating income as well as the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of 2011 the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in operating income 

on january 2 2013 the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 under prior law a taxpayer was entitled to a research tax credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred on or before december 31 2011 the 2012 taxpayer relief act extends the research credit for two years to december 31 2013 the extension of the research credit is retroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after december 31 2011 as a result of the retroactive extension we expect to recognize a benefit of approximately 48 million for qualifying amounts incurred in 2012 the benefit will be recognized in the period of enactment which is the first quarter of 2013 

we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2013  to decrease due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit at the beginning of 2013 as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stockbased compensation or any potential tax planning strategies our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options further our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to the financial measures reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we also compile and monitor certain nongaap financial measures related to the performance of our business we have discussed the nongaap financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls and in other investor presentations a “nongaap financial measure” is a numerical measure of a companys historical or future financial performance financial 

position or cash flows that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations or includes amounts that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 

we believe that making available nongaap financial measures may be helpful to investors as they examine our past performance and future prospects especially when comparing such results to previous periods our management uses some of these nongaap financial measures in addition to gaap financial measures as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods some of these financial measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

these nongaap financial measures should only be used as a supplement to results presented in accordance with gaap 

in the periods presented we calculated normalized net income by adding the following items on a nontaxeffected basis to net income calculated in accordance with gaap amortization of other acquired intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits acquisitionrelated costs and benefits certain gains and losses on investments loss on early extinguishment of debt gains and losses on legal settlements and other nonrecurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 



as indicated in the text and reconciliation above we have historically reported normalized net income by adding the items above on a nontaxeffected basis to gaap net income if we were to taxeffect the above items in our calculation of normalized net income normalized net income for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 would have been 291 million or 160 per share 256 million or 137 per share and 234 million or 123 per share respectively 

we calculate adjusted ebitda in the same way that we calculate normalized net income except that we also add interest income income taxes and depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  

  



liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated by operations public and private sales of debt and equity securities and proceeds from exercises of stock awards 

as of december 31 2012  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate debt securities united states treasury and government agency securities commercial paper and money market funds totaled 10952 million  the majority of which is located in the united states we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 779 million  to 5304 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 4526 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  was primarily due to increases in receipts from customers which were partially offset by increases in payments to vendors as well as increases in payments for employee payroll the increases in accounts payable accrued expenses and other current liabilities were primarily driven by the timing of payments in the normal business cycle these increases were offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes net cash provided by operating activities increased by  501 million  to  4526 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to  4025 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense and a decrease in our excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes we expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase in 2013 as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates 

net cash used in investing activities was 7790 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 1711 million  of net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  net cash used in investing activities was 3354 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  cash used in investing activities for 2012  reflects purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of  7523 million  purchases of property and equipment of 2198 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs and cash paid for the acquisition of four companies in 2012 for  3367 million  in the aggregate amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 5301 million during 2011  we had a significant increase in cash provided by investing activities due to investments maturing that we did not reinvest in short and longterm marketable securities cash provided by investing activities for 2011  reflects proceeds from sales and redemptions of short and longterm marketable securities 

of  7013 million  proceeds from maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of  5329 million  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of  02 million  and a decrease in cash investments held for security deposits of  03 million  this was offset in part by purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of  8801 million  purchases of property and equipment of  1829 million  including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs and earn out payments related to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of velocitude llc or velocitude of  06 million  cash used in investing activities for 2010  reflects purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 11465 million purchases of property and equipment of 1920 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs cash paid for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of velocitude of 127 million and an increase in other investments of 05 million amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 10158 million for 2013  we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to remain consistent with 2012 as a percentage of total revenue for the year we expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations 

cash used in financing activities decreased  1856 million  to 1085 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 2941 million  used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  cash used in financing activities was 177 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2012  consisted of 1415 million  related to our 2012  common stock repurchase programs as well as 347 million  used to pay taxes related to net share settlements of employee equity awards this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012  which included proceeds of 447 million  from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 230 million  related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  consisted of  3241 million  related to our 2011  common stock repurchase programs as well as  84 million  used to pay taxes related to the net share settlement of employee equity awards this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  which included proceeds of  253 million  from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and  131 million  related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2010  consisted of  924 million  related to our 2010 common stock repurchase programs this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010  which included proceeds of  458 million  from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and  290 million  related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt and equity repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 



we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2012  for the next five years and thereafter in millions 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2012  we had unrecognized tax benefits of  269 million  which included  59 million  of accrued interest and penalties as of december 31 2012  we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately 37 million of our unrecognized tax benefits each of which are individually insignificant and include research and development credits and transfer pricing adjustments may be recognized by the end of 2013 as a result of ongoing audits 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2012  we had outstanding 62 million  in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases these irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

litigation 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended guidance and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements this guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards the guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements we adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2012 the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income “oci” as part of the statement of changes in equity under the amended guidance all changes in oci are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements we adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2012 there is no impact to our consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation 

in september 2011 the fasb issued amended guidance that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment under the amended guidance after assessment of certain qualitative factors if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the entity must perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test otherwise the quantitative tests are optional we adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2012 the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in july 2012 the fasb issued amended guidance on the periodic testing of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment this guidance allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test required under current accounting standards the updated accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after september 15 2012 with early adoption permitted we adopted the updated guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued guidance and disclosure requirements for reporting of comprehensive income amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the guidance requires that an entity provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after december 15 2012 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2013 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including government agency obligations high quality corporate bonds and money market funds investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses conversely our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transaction exposure 

the company enters into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were determined to be immaterial during the year ended december 31 2012  

translation exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity which is reflected in our balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers as of december 31 2012 and 2011  one customer had an account receivable balance greater than 10 of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2012  concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was not significant

making the cloud work for our customers 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other entities conduct business and reach the public enterprises want to offer a dynamic consistent secure experience for millions of end users and to take advantage of the potential cost savings of utilizing the cloud a term commonly used to refer to utilizing the web server facilities of a third party provider on the internet the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands or the dramatic expansion in the number and types of devices individuals use to access it 

the ad hoc internet architecture presents potential problems for its widespread usage today such as 

 these potential problems intersect with the features of what we call the hyperconnected world including 

 2 

 the resulting individual experience can be a disappointing one this is a central challenge facing all internetfocused enterprises 

achieving an enterprises goals in the face of this challenge is made more difficult by internal technology issues driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives the dramatic increase in internet usage places extensive demands on infrastructure however expanding internal systems to meet routine demand can be costprohibitive keeping pace with new developments can also be a difficult challenge special marketing or promotional initiatives or unanticipated onetime events such as important unanticipated news may draw millions of additional visitors to a company’s website over a brief period of time putting in place incremental internal infrastructure to deal with such spikes is likely not practicable 

akamai has developed solutions to assist enterprises in meeting their goals in spite of the challenges at the intersection of the internet and the hyperconnected world our services are designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations we particularly seek to make using the cloud a viable approach for customers by addressing the following market needs

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

with respect to our ads offerings we compete with a range of other companies that provide targeted advertising solutions at the same time some of the companies that offer competitive solutions have entered into strategic agreements with us that we believe are mutually beneficial we compete on the basis of our technology the availability of our data cooperative our predictive analytics capabilities the ability to leverage existing business relationships and price 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and value

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

we face intense competition the consequences of which could adversely affect our business 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing the competitive landscape is varied and presents numerous different challenges including 

 ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions lower gross margins loss of customers and loss of market share each of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to continue to innovate and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions our ability to provide new and innovative solutions to address the evolving ways enterprises use the internet is important to our future growth and profitability if we fail to do so our operating results will likely be significantly harmed if other companies develop technological or business model innovations in the markets we seek to address that are or are perceived to be equivalent or superior to our services then our revenue and profitability could also suffer in addition our customers’ business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and the failure to address these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers’ needs for our services the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources 

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition pricing pressure the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and macroeconomic factors affecting certain aspects of our business we also believe our gross margins may decrease because we have large fixed expenses 

and expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth colocation and other expenses including increased depreciation on network equipment purchased in recent years as a result we may not be able to continue to maintain our current level of profitability in 2012 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 we may be unable to replace lost revenues due to customer cancellations or renewals at lower rates 

our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their existing terms which are typically 12 to 24 months some may elect not to renew and others may renew at lower prices lower committed traffic levels or for shorter contract lengths we cannot accurately predict renewal rates our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including customer dissatisfaction with our service customers ability to continue their operations and spending levels and deteriorating general economic conditions it is key to our profitability that we offset lost committed recurring revenue due to customer cancellations terminations price reductions or other less favorable terms by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functionalities that our existing customers purchase if we are unable to do so our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

we may be unable to develop robust strategic relationships with third parties such failure could significantly limit our longterm growth 

our future success will likely require us to maintain and increase the number and depth of our relationships with resellers systems integrators and other strategic partners the need to develop such relationship can be particularly acute in areas outside of the united states we have not always been successful at developing these relationships due to the complexity of our services our historical reliance on an internal sales force a past lack of strategic focus on such arrangements and other factors recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use of our technology and services requires significant time and resources in order to develop and expand our distribution channel we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel including our investment in systems and training and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage the time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our offerings including our new services developments may make it more difficult to introduce those products to enterprises our failure to maintain and increase the number of relationships with channel partners could significantly impede our revenue growth prospects in the short and long term 

our failure to manage expected growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

our future operating results will depend on our ability to manage our operations in the past we have restructured aspects of our operations and made other adjustments to our organization in response to management changes product changes performance issues and other internal and external considerations and we may take similar actions in the future such actions can result in lack of focus and reduced productivity 

as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however most management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth and decentralize our decision making at rates commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals in addition if we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees our business may be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different 

systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to manage our technical support infrastructure effectively we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers if we elect to move into new areas that involve handling personally identifiable information or other important assets entrusted to us by our customers the potential risks we face and magnitude of losses could increase 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services or attacks on our internal information technology systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard affected customers will be entitled to credits our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users 

cybersecurity attacks and other security breaches could expose us to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 

there have been and in the future may be attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems in order to steal information about our technology financial data or other information or take other actions that would be damaging to us such attacks may be pursued through electronic means or through damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions and security breaches there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our security measures will be effective that we will quickly detect an attack or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation any insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to cover all or a significant portion of the losses we could suffer from a successful attack any successful breach of the security of our information systems could lead to the unauthorized release of valuable confidential information including trade secrets material nonpublic information about our financial condition and sensitive data that others could use to compete against us such events could likely harm our business and reputation in addition we offer services designed to address the internet security needs of our customers any failure of those solutions to operate effectively or to provide benefits promised by us could reduce our revenues and harm or business and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and colocation space which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers and access to colocation facilities to house our servers we believe that absent extraordinary circumstances we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers and ultimately loss of those customers in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our gross margins 

the potential exhaustion of the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses and the inability of akamai and other internet users to successfully transition to ipv6 could harm our operations and the functioning of the internet as a whole 

an internet protocol address or ip address is a numerical label that is assigned to any device connecting to the internet today the functioning of the internet is dependent on the use of internet protocol version 4 or ipv4 the fourth version of the 

internet protocol which uses 32bit addresses we currently rely on the acquisition of ip addresses for the functioning and expansion of our network and expect such reliance to continue in the future there are however only a finite number of ipv4 addresses it is possible that the number of unallocated ipv4 addresses may be exhausted within one to two years internet protocol version 6 or ipv6 uses 128bit addresses and has been designed to succeed ipv4 and alleviate the expected exhaustion of unallocated addresses under that version while ipv4 and ipv6 will coexist for some period of time eventually all internet users and companies will need to transition to ipv6 while akamai has been developing plans for the transition to ipv6 and ensuring that we are prepared to meet our needs and those of our customers for both ipv4 and ipv6based technology there is no guarantee that such plans will be effective if we are unable to obtain the ipv4 addresses we need on financial terms acceptable to us or at all before we or other entities that rely on the internet can transition to ipv6 our current and future operations could be materially harmed if there is not a timely and successful transition to ipv6 by internet users generally the internet could function less effectively which could damage numerous businesses the economy generally and the prospects for future growth of the internet as a medium for transacting business this could in turn be harmful to our financial condition and results of operation 

as part of our business strategy we have entered and may seek to enter into business combinations acquisitions and other strategic relationships that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 

we have completed numerous acquisitions in recent years if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases we may also enter into other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the transactions and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with a future acquisition or combination in december 2011 we announced that we had reached an agreement to purchase cotendo inc if we are not successful in completing the acquisition of cotendo or other acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result in addition future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership operational responsibilities and other significant matters such disputes may be expensive and timeconsuming to resolve 

our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 any of these events may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located this affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we compensate 

our officers and employees in part through equity incentives including stock options some of these stock options held by our officers and employees have exercise prices in excess of the current market price of our common stock which has diminished the retentive value of such options the loss of the services of any of our key employees could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology any such action naming akamai could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us 

we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention of our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable developments and changes in patent law such as changes in interpretations of the joint infringement standard could also restrict how we enforce certain patents we hold monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from mit technology that is covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on certain “opensource” software the use of which could result in our having to distribute our proprietary software including our source code to third parties on unfavorable terms which could materially affect our business 

certain of our service offerings use software that is subject to opensource licenses opensource code is software that is freely accessible usable and modifiable certain opensource code is governed by license agreements the terms of which could require users of such opensource code to make any derivative works of such opensource code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost because we use opensource code we may be required to take remedial action in order to protect our proprietary software such action could include replacing certain source code used in our software discontinuing certain of our products or 

taking other actions that could divert resources away from our development efforts in addition the terms relating to disclosure of derivative works in many opensource licenses are unclear we periodically review our compliance with the opensource licenses we use and do not believe we will be required to make our proprietary software freely available however if a court interprets one or more such opensource licenses in a manner that is unfavorable to us we could be required to make certain of our key software available at no cost 

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

significant portions of our business depend on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats if our legal right or technical ability to store and deliver content in one or more popular proprietary content formats such as adobe ®  flash ®  or windows ®  media ®  were to become limited our ability to serve our customers in these formats would be impaired and the demand for our content delivery services would decline by customers using these formats owners of propriety content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price in addition new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future that could adversely affect our reported financial results 

we may have exposure to greaterthananticipated tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items such as equityrelated compensation we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability although we believe our estimates and reserves are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made in addition we have historically derived benefits from the availability of certain research and development tax credits under federal and state tax regulations if the availability of such credits is not extended by the applicable taxing authorities our tax liability would increase 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

we have complied with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 by assessing strengthening and testing our system of internal controls even though we concluded our system of internal controls was effective as of december 31 2011 we need to continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business accordingly this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive and timeconsuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as our business changes and if we expand through acquisitions of other companies our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls overall remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent 

registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remediated could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 

general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor worldwide economy has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows to the extent customers are unable to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

a portion of our revenues is derived from international operations revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonlocal currencies while we have implemented a foreign currency hedging program there is no guarantee that such program will be fully effective 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures which could harm our profitability we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have a publiclyavailable privacy policy concerning collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business particularly the advertisingrelated services we offer it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with potentially varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a 

manner adverse to our business 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent copyright protection tax consumer protection antidiscrimination and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services in addition domestic and international government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could negatively impact our business 

global climate change regulations could adversely impact our business 

recent scientific studies and other news reports suggest the possibility of global climate change in response governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business our deployed network of tens of thousands of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels it is possible that future regulatory or legislative initiatives or customer demands could affect the costs of operating our network of servers and our other operations such costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenues and damage to our reputation 

our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

we derive revenues from contracts with the us government state and local governments and their respective agencies which may terminate most of these contracts at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending most of our government contracts are subject to legislative approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts these factors may join to limit the revenues we derive from government contracts in the future additionally government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 in addition our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us

legal proceedings 

tableend we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition to ordinarycourse litigation we are a party to the litigation described below 

on or about october 3 2007 vanessa simmonds a purported akamai shareholder filed a complaint in the us district court for the western district of washington against the underwriters involved in our 1999 initial public offering of common stock alleging violations of section 16b of the exchange act of 1934 as amended the complaint alleges that the combined number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the lead underwriters and certain unnamed officers directors and principal shareholders exceeded ten percent of our outstanding common stock from the date of our initial public offering on october 29 1999 through at least october 28 2000 the complaint further alleges that those entities and individuals were thus subject to the reporting requirements of section 16a and the shortswing trading prohibition of section 16b and failed to comply with those provisions the complaint seeks to recover from the lead underwriters any “shortswing profits” obtained by them in violation of section 16b akamai was named as a nominal defendant in the action but has no liability for the asserted claims none of our directors or officers serving in such capacities at the time of our initial public offering are currently named as defendants in this action but there can be no guarantee that the complaint will not be amended or a new complaint or suit filed to name such directors or officers as defendants in this action or another action alleging a violation of the same provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended on march 12 2009 the court granted a joint motion by akamai and other issuer defendants to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to make an adequate demand on us prior to filing her complaint in its order the court stated it would not permit the plaintiff to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation 

because the court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction it did not specifically reach the issue of whether the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations however the court also granted a joint motion to dismiss by the underwriter defendants in the action with respect to cases involving nonmoving issuers holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers’ shareholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit the plaintiff appealed on december 2 2010 the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court’s decision to dismiss the moving issuers’ cases including the company’s on the grounds that plaintiff’s demand letters were insufficient to put the issuers on notice of the claims asserted against them and further ordered that the dismissals be made with prejudice the ninth circuit however reversed and remanded the district court’s decision on the underwriters’ motion to dismiss as to the claims arising from the nonmoving issuers’ ipos finding plaintiff’s claims were not timebarred under the applicable statute of limitations on january 18 2011 the ninth circuit denied various parties’ petitions for rehearing and for rehearing en banc but stayed its rulings to allow for appeals to the united states supreme court on april 5 2011 the plaintiff filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court seeking reversal of the ninth circuits decision relating to the adequacy of the presuit demand on april 15 2011 underwriter defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court seeking reversal of the ninth circuits decision relating to the statute of limitation issue on june 27 2011 the supreme court denied the plaintiffs petition regarding the demand issue but granted the underwriters petition relating to the statute of limitations issue the supreme court heard oral arguments on the latter issue in late 2011 we do not expect the results of this action to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

we provide content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum in recent years we have also entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly annual or longer periods having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services and features that our existing customers purchase at the same time we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof 

recent event 

on february 8 2012 we announced the resignation of j donald sherman as our chief financial officer effective on february 29 2012 and the appointment of james benson akamais senior vice president of finance as his successor effective as of march 1 2012 

overview of financial results 

our increase in net income in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2009 reflected the success of our efforts to increase our recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

  



we were profitable for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 

revenues and customers 

 costs and expenses 

 based on our analysis of among other things the aforementioned trends and events as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2012  however our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our ability to 

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including generating positive net income in any future period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities capitalized internaluse software costs goodwill and other intangible assets tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe thirdparty evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities 

we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different 

from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as of december 31 2011 and 2010  we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december 31 2011 and 2010  we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such dates and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

loss contingencies 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose the nature of these loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

tax reserves 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement as of december 31 2011 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 172 million including accrued interest and penalties 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options rsus and deferred stock units we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards 

at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stockbased awards which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock options that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 

for stock options rsus and deferred stock units that contain only a servicebased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards’ vesting period for awards with a performance conditionbased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting period commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs as well as stockbased compensation expense of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

results of operations 

revenues  total revenues increased 13  or 1350 million  to 11585 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 10236 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  total revenues increased 19  or 1638 million  to 10236 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 8598 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  the following table quantifies the increase in revenues attributable to the different industry verticals in which we sell our services in millions 



we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years we expect this trend to continue in 2012  but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and competitive factors 

the increase in revenues for 2011 as compared to 2010 as well as 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven by increased revenues from our media and entertainment vertical due to traffic growth partially offset by reduced prices charged to our customers revenues from our commerce and enterprise verticals increased due to growth in application and cloud performance solutions sold to customers in these verticals revenues from our high tech vertical in 2011 as compared to 2010 remained relatively flat as increased demand for application and cloud performance solutions offset the decline in software download revenues the increase in revenues from our high tech vertical in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to an increase in traffic growth as well as an increase in demand for our application and cloud performance solution services our 2011 revenues from the public sector vertical did not materially change as compared to 2010 the increase in 2010 revenues from public sector customers as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and government contracts 

for 2011 2010 and 2009  29  28  and 28  respectively of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the united states revenue from our operations in europe represented 18  17  and 18  of total revenues for 2011 

2010 and 2009  respectively other than the united states no single country accounted for 10  or more of our total revenues during these periods we expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in 2012 to remain consistent as compared to 2011 

resellers accounted for 19  of total revenues in 2011  18  in 2010  and 18  in 2009  for 2011 2010 and 2009  no single customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenues 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions 



cost of revenues increased 23  or 711 million  to 3745 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 3034 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  cost of revenues increased 21  or 535 million  to 3034 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 2499 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  in each instance these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit an increase in colocation costs as we deployed more servers and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internaluse software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure additionally in each of 2011 2010 and 2009  cost of revenues included stockbased compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation such expense decreased by 07 million  in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased by 17 million  in 2010 as compared to 2009 cost of revenues during each of 2011 2010 and 2009  also included credits received of approximately 69 million  71 million  and 35 million  respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any are unpredictable 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers as of december 31 2011  our current minimum commitments for the years ending december 31 2012  2013  2014  and 2015  were approximately 888 million  128 million  07 million  and 01 million  respectively 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 we expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and colocation fees however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally for 2012 we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for research and development personnel who design develop test deploy and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009  we capitalized software development costs of 390 million  311 million  and 258 million  respectively net of impairments these development costs consisted of external consulting payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009  we capitalized as internaluse software 71 million  76 million  and 62 million  respectively of noncash stockbased compensation net of impairments we amortize these capitalized internaluse software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

research and development expenses decreased 4  or 24 million  to 523 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 548 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  research and development expenses increased 25  or 111 million  to 548 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 437 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  the decrease in research and development expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due to higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stockbased compensation partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth the increase in research and development expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation partially offset by higher capitalized salaries the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions 



we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased 06 million  to 2273 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 2267 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  sales and marketing expenses increased 26  or 473 million  to 2267 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 1794 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and sales support personnel attributable to revenue growth largely offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation marketing and related costs and other expenses the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly higher commissions for sales and sales support personnel an increase in stockbased compensation marketing and related costs and an increase in other expenses such as travel costs which was partially offset by a reduction in training and conference costs 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 



we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2012 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 27 

 general and administrative expenses increased 14  or 239 million  to 1917 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 1678 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  general and administrative expenses increased 15  or 217 million  to 1678 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 1461 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth an increase in facilitiesrelated costs and other expenses such as acquisition related costs an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and an increase in legal fees these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation and nonincome tax expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth and increases in stockbased compensation facilitiesrelated costs and other expenses such as noncapitializable equipment purchases and maintenance these increases were partially offset by reductions in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2010 as compared to 2009 

the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

  



we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased 2  or 04 million  to 171 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 167 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  amortization of other intangible assets remained consistent at 167 million  for each of the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009  the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2011  as compared to 2010  was due to the acquisition of velocitude in june 2010 as of december 31 2011 we anticipate that amortization expense will be approximately 166 million  132 million  72 million  46 million  and 21 million  for the years ending december 31 2012  2013  2014  2015  and 2016  respectively 

restructuring charge we recorded a restructuring charge of 49 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily in connection with a workforce reduction we implemented in december 2011 this charge included 42 million of employee severance benefits and 07 million of restructuring charges attributable to vacated facility leases during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a restructuring charge of 05 million in connection with employee severance benefits we did not have any restructuring charges in 2010 we expect that our restructuring liabilities associated with employee severance benefits will be fully paid in 2012 restructuring liabilities associated with facility leases will be fully paid through december 2019 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income 

decreased 12  or 15 million  to 107 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 122 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  interest income decreased 22  or 35 million  to 122 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 156 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  the decreases in 2011 as compared to 2010 and in 2010 as compared to 2009 were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods 

interest expense interest expense includes interest that was paid on our former debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs during the year ended december 31 2011 we had no outstanding interestbearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest and therefore had no interest expense interest expense decreased 40  or 11 million  to 17 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  compared to 28 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1 convertible senior notes the decrease in interest expense in 2010 resulted from the conversion into common stock of an aggregate of 1998 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible notes during that year 

other income expense net other income expense  net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred gains and losses from legal settlements and other nonoperating income expense items other income expense net increased 86 million  to 61 million  of income for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 25 million  of expense for the year ended december 31 2010  other income expense net decreased 26 million  to 25 million  of expense for the year ended december 31 2010  as compared to 02 million  of income for the year ended december 31 2009  other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2011  consisted of foreign exchange losses and net funds received and paid as part of litigation settlements other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2010  consisted of foreign exchange losses other income net for the year ended december 31 2009  consisted of 08 million of gains on legal settlements and 11 million of gains on divesture of certain assets offset by 17 million of foreign exchange losses other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 

loss gain on investments net during the year ended december 31 2011  we recorded a net loss on investments of 02 million  primarily related to the sale of marketable securities and a writeoff of an equity investment during the year ended december 31 2010  we recorded a net gain on investments of 04 million  primarily related to the sale of marketable securities additionally during 2010 we recorded a gain of 96 million due to a decrease in the otherthantemporary impairment of certain auction rate securities or ars offset by a loss of 96 million on a put option related to our ars holdings during the year ended december 31 2009  we recorded a net gain on investments of 08 million  which primarily related to an unrealized gain of 33 million from a decrease in the otherthantemporary impairment of certain marketable securities offset by an unrealized loss of 29 million on a put option related to our ars holdings 

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2011 our effective tax rate of 346 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits and the tax rate differential on foreign earnings partially offset by state income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 our effective tax rate of 347 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefits recorded for research and development tax credits partially offset by state income taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 our effective tax rate of 385 was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits provision for income taxes increased 17 or 151 million to 1063 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 912 million for the year ended december 31 2010 provision for income taxes remained consistent at 912 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 913 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to an increase in operating income the slight decrease from 2009 to 2010 was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate offset by an increase in operating income 

we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2012 to increase due to the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of 2011 as well as the change in mix of income in various jurisdictions this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stockbased compensation or any potential tax planning strategies our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options further our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different 

taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

nongaap measures 

in addition to the traditional financial measurements reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we also compile and monitor certain nongaap financial measures related to the performance of our business we typically discuss the nongaap financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls a “nongaap financial measure” is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 

we believe that making available the nongaap financial measures described below helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects especially when comparing such results to previous periods forecasts or competitors’ financial information our management uses these nongaap measures in addition to gaap financial measures as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors these measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

we consider normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted common share to be important indicators of our overall performance as they eliminate the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are noncash items we define normalized net income as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding the following pretax items amortization of other acquired intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits acquisitionrelated costs and benefits certain gains and losses on investments loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains and losses on legal settlements 

these nongaap financial measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009  



we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of our operational strength and the performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay we define adjusted ebitda as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding interest income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits acquisitionrelated costs and benefits certain gains and losses on investments foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains or losses on legal settlements 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009  

  



for the year ended december 31 2009 we previously reported utilization of tax nolscredits of 842 million in the tables above which increased our nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda beginning in 2010 we no longer include utilization of tax nolscredits in determining our nongaap net income and adjusted ebitda due to fully utilizing most of our nols and tax credit carryforwards in 2010 

these nongaap financial measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities proceeds from exercises of stock awards and cash generated by operations 

as of december 31 2011  our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate debt securities united states treasury and government agency securities commercial paper corporate debt securities and money market funds totaled 12300 million  the majority of which is located in the united states we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

we held approximately 1508 million in par value of auction rate securities or ars at december 31 2010 ars are primarily aaarated bonds most of which are guaranteed by the us government as part of the federal family education loan program through the us department of education during 2011 all of our remaining ars were fully redeemed and sold 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 501 million  to 4526 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 4025 million  for the year ended december 31 2010  the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the year ended december 31 2010  was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense and a decrease in our excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation offset by a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 220 million to 4025 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 4244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense offset by an increase in working capital an increase in our excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and a decrease in our provision for 

deferred income taxes we expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates 

net cash provided by investing activities was 1711 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 3354 million  of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2010  net cash used in investing activities was 3575 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  during 2011 we had a significant increase in cash provided by investing activities due to investments maturing in which we did not reinvest in short and longterm marketable securities cash provided by investing activities for 2011 reflects proceeds from sales and redemptions of short and longterm marketable securities of 7013 million  proceeds from maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 5329 million  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 02 million  and a decrease in cash investments held for security deposits of 03 million  this was offset in part by purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 8801 million  purchases of property and equipment of 1829 million  including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs and earn out payments for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of velocitude of 06 million  cash used in investing activities for 2010 reflects purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 11465 million purchases of property and equipment of 1920 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs cash paid for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of velocitude of 127 million and an increase in other investments of 05 million amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 10158 million cash used in investing activities for 2009 reflects a 58 million earnout payment associated with our purchase of acerno purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 7904 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1081 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 5451 million for 2012 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately 15  of total revenue for the year we expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations 

cash used in financing activities was 2941 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 177 million  used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010  cash used in financing activities was 425 million  for the year ended december 31 2009  cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2011 consisted of 3241 million  related to our 2011 common stock repurchase programs as well as 84 million  used for taxes paid related to the net share settlements of equity awards this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011  which included proceeds of 253 million  from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 131 million  related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2010 consisted of 924 million related to our 2010 common stock repurchase programs this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 which included proceeds of 458 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 290 million related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2009 consisted of 665 million related to a common stock repurchase program we initiated in april 2009 this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 which included proceeds of 217 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 22 million related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt and equity repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2011  for the next five years and thereafter in millions 

  



in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2011 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 172 million which included 47 million of accrued interest and penalties we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2012 we are not however able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2010 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued an accounting standard update for business combinations specifically related to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations this guidance specifies that pro forma disclosures should be reported as if the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period and the pro forma disclosures must include a description of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments this standard was effective for business combinations with an acquisition date of january 1 2011 or later the adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in may 2011 the fasb issued amended guidance and disclosure requirements for fair value measurements this guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards the guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements this standard will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 and will be applied prospectively the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income or oci as part of the statement of changes in equity under the amended guidance all changes in oci are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements the changes will be effective january 1 2012 and early adoption is permitted there will be no impact on our consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation 

in september 2011 the fasb issued amended guidance that will simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment under the amended guidance after assessment of certain qualitative factors if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount entities must perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test otherwise the quantitative tests are optional the guidance is effective january 1 2012 with early adoption permitted we intend to adopt this guidance effective january 1 2012 the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

interest rate risk 

our portfolio of cash equivalents and short and longterm investments is maintained in a variety of securities including government agency obligations high quality corporate bonds and money market funds investments are classified as availableforsale securities and carried at their fair market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair market value of certain securities in our portfolio we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

foreign currency risk 

growth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations including but not limited to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currencydenominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses conversely our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transaction exposure 

the company enters into shortterm foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in nonfunctional currencies changes in the fair value of these derivatives as well as remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in other expense net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were determined to be immaterial during the year ended december 31 2011  

translation exposure 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity which is reflected in our balance sheet under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

credit risk 

concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which we make substantial sales our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across numerous industries to reduce risk we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers based on such assessments we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited as of december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  one customer had an account receivable balance greater than 10 of our accounts receivable we believe that at december 31 2011  concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was not significant

meeting the challenges of the internet 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other entities conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the challenges inherent in delivering content over the internet are compounded by the internal technology challenges facing enterprises driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives for example many companies use the internet as a key marketing tool for product launches distribution of promotional videos or contests these onetime events may draw millions of visitors to a company’s website over a brief period of time so the enterprise must have in place the capacity to deal with a flood of visitors seeking to view content or use applications at the same time budget limitations may preclude a company from putting in place extensive internal infrastructure knowing that it will not always need such capacity in addition as reliance on the internet has become more pervasive website operators have been experiencing higher levels of traffic to their sites on a constant basis which place extensive demands on infrastructure 

to address these challenges we have developed solutions designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations we particularly seek to address the following market needs 

superior performance  commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers transact business and provide information about themselves if however a company’s internet site fails to provide visitors with a fast and dependable experience they will likely abandon that site potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the company’s reputation through a combination of people processes and technology we help our customers improve the scalability and predictability of their websites without the need for them to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have tens of thousands of servers deployed in more than 900 networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the “edge” of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations for our customers at the same time our customers have access to control features to enable them to provide content to end users that is current and customized for visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world 

scalability  we believe that scalability is one of the keys to reliability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites and almost all websites experience demand peaks at 

  

different points during the day with the proliferation of hd video and other types of rich content enterprises of all types must be able to cope with rapidly increasing numbers of requests for bandwidthintensive digital media assets and the storage of those assets in all of these instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions to meet such peaks and valleys with more than 80000 servers managed by our proprietary software technology our network is designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned traffic peaks and related storage needs without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an ondemand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure 

security security is one of the most significant challenges facing use of the internet for business and government processes security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can impact every measure of performance including information security speed reliability and customer confidence unlike traditional security strategies that can negatively impact performance akamai’s approach is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance may not be compromised perhaps most significantly the distributed nature of our network is designed to eliminate a single point of failure and reduce the impact of security attacks 

functionality websites have become increasingly dynamic complex and sophisticated to meet these challenges we have added solutions through both internal investment and acquisitions these solutions have included services designed to help our customers accelerate dynamic content and applications more effectively manage their online media assets adapt content for access through mobile devices and improve the quality of their online advertising initiatives

to make this widereaching deployment effective we use specialized technologies such as advanced routing load balancing data collection and monitoring our intelligent routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors experience fast page loading access to applications and content assembly wherever they are on the internet regardless of global or local traffic conditions dedicated professionals staff our network operations control centers on a 247 basis to monitor and react to internet traffic patterns and trends we frequently deploy enhancements to our software globally to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of our network customers are also able to control the extent of their use of akamai services to scale on demand using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as they require to support widely varying traffic and rapid growth without the need for an expensive and complex internal infrastructure 

business segments and geographic information 

we operate in one industry segment providing services for accelerating and improving delivery of content and applications over the internet for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 28 28 and 25 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations outside the united states of which 17 18 and 18 of overall revenues respectively was derived from europe no single country outside of the united states accounted for 10 or more of our revenues in any of such years for more segment and geographic information including total longlived assets for each of the last two fiscal years see our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including note 19 thereto 

  

our longlived assets primarily consist of servers which are deployed into networks worldwide as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1749 million and 810 million of property and equipment net of accumulated depreciation located in the united states and foreign locations respectively as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 1398 million and 426 million of property and equipment net of accumulated depreciation located in the united states and foreign locations respectively as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 1386 million and 359 million of property and equipment net of accumulated depreciation located in the united states and foreign locations respectively 

customers 

our customer base is centered on enterprises as of december 31 2010 our customers included many of the world’s leading corporations including adobe apple audi best buy emc hitachi home depot l’oreal microsoft mtv networks the national football league philips qantas sap standard chartered bank and victoria’s secret we also actively sell to government agencies as of december 31 2010 our public sector customers included the federal emergency management agency the us air force the us census bureau the us department of defense the us food and drug administration and the us department of labor no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 or 2008 less than 10 of our total revenues in each of the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10 of our total revenues in 2011 

sales service and marketing 

our sales and service professionals are located in more than 20 offices in the united states europe and asia we market and sell our services and solutions globally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 100 active channel partners including eds an hp company ibm corporation verizon and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketingfocused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers sales agents and referral partners by aligning with these companies we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

our sales and service organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1060 employees in our sales and support organization including 179 direct sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit train and retain sufficient global sales technical and services personnel and how well we establish and maintain our reseller and strategic alliances we believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows strategic alliances and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2010 we had 112 employees in our global marketing organization which is a component of our sales and support organization 

research and development 

our research and development personnel are continuously undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing services strengthen our network and create new services in response to our customers’ needs and market demand as of december 31 2010 we had 571 research and development employees our research and development expenses were 548 million 437 million and 392 million for the years ended december 31 

  

2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition for each of the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized 311 million 258 million and 239 million respectively of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used by us to deliver our services and operate our network additionally during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized 76 million 62 million and 74 million respectively of stockbased compensation attributable to our research and development personnel 

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of our competitors also resell our services other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

with respect to our ads offerings we compete with a range of other companies that provide targeted advertising solutions at the same time some of the companies that offer competitive solutions have entered into strategic agreements with us that we believe are mutually beneficial we compete on the basis of our technology the availability of our data cooperative our predictive analytics capabilities the ability to leverage existing business relationships and price 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and price 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content and application delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in 

  

october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had 2200 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with innovative approaches and established companies with greater resources 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition as we expand into new areas to address the evolving nature of the internet we may face competition from new and different companies many of these potential competitors as well as some of our current ones have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do other competitors may attract customers by offering lesssophisticated versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge given the relative ease with which some customers can potentially switch to another content delivery network provider any differentiated offerings or lower pricing by competitors could lead to a rapid loss of customers nimbler competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements in addition current or potential competitors may bundle their offerings with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer 

potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai as a result our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased it is an important component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and government agencies about our services and convince them to entrust their content and applications to an external service provider and akamai in particular if we are unsuccessful in such efforts our business could suffer 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions lower gross margins loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to continue to innovate and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions for example individuals are increasingly using mobile devices to access internet content our ability to provide new and innovative solutions to address challenges posed by 

  

mobile users and other developments is important to our future growth other companies are also looking to offer internetrelated solutions such as cloud computing to generate growth these other companies may develop technological or business model innovations in the markets we seek to address that are or are perceived to be equivalent or superior to our services in addition our customers’ business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers’ needs for our services our operating results depend on our ability to adapt to market changes and develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources 

prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve 

in recent quarters we have lowered the prices we charge many of our customers for our content delivery services in order to remain competitive this has been particularly true for the digital media services consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes in addition our operating expenses have increased on an absolute basis in each of 2008 2009 and 2010 if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to new or existing content delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

our revenue growth rate may decline in 2011 as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and macroeconomic factors affecting certain aspects of our business we also believe our gross margins will decrease because we have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth colocation and other expenses including increased depreciation on network equipment purchased in recent years as a result we may not be able to continue to maintain our current level of profitability in 2011 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor worldwide economy has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows in particular weakness in the online advertising market has affected and could continue to affect the success of our internet advertisingrelated initiatives and could have a negative impact on our media and other customers to the extent customers are unable to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver on their behalf such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

our failure to manage expected growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

we have continued to grow diversify and evolve our business both in the united states and internationally it is unclear however whether such growth will continue in the event of a slowing or decline in our rate of growth we must also address the challenges of establishing an appropriate organizational size while maintaining the quality of our services if we are unable to do so our profitability could be reduced 

as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters however nearly all management decisions are made by a relatively small group of individuals based primarily at our headquarters if we are unable to appropriately increase management depth and decentralize our decision making at rates commensurate with our actual or desired growth rates we may not be able to achieve our financial or operational goals in addition if we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees our business may be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to effectively manage our technical support infrastructure we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software 

  

in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers if we elect to move into new areas that involve handling personally identifiable information or other important assets entrusted to us by our customers the potential risks we face could increase 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services or attacks on our internal information technology systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard affected customers will be entitled to credits our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services 

such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users in addition there have been and in the future may be attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems in order to steal information about our technology financial data or other information or take other actions that would be damaging to us although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions and security breaches there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation any successful breach of the security of our information systems could lead to the unauthorized release of valuable confidential information including trade secrets material nonpublic information about our financial condition and sensitive data that others could use to compete against us such consequences would likely harm our business and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and server capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers in addition our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers’ traffic particularly in the event of unexpected surges in hd video traffic we believe that absent extraordinary circumstances we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers and ultimately loss of those customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer in recent years it has become increasingly expensive to collocate or house our servers at network facilities we expect this trend to continue these increased expenses have made and will make it more costly for us to expand our operations and more difficult for us to maintain or improve our gross margins if we are unable to deploy on a timely and costeffective basis enough servers to meet the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the functioning of those servers we may lose customers in addition damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

  

the potential exhaustion of the supply of unallocated ipv4 addresses and the inability of akamai and other internet users to successfully transition to ipv6 could harm our operations and the functioning of the internet as a whole 

an internet protocol address or ip address is a numerical label that is assigned to any device connecting to the internet today the functioning of the internet is dependent on the use of internet protocol version 4 or ipv4 the fourth version of the internet protocol which uses 32bit addresses we currently rely on the acquisition of ip addresses for the functioning and expansion of our network and expect such reliance to continue in the future there are however only a finite number of ipv4 addresses it is possible that the number of unallocated ipv4 addresses may be exhausted within one to two years internet protocol version 6 or ipv6 uses 128bit addresses and has been designed to succeed ipv4 and alleviate the expected exhaustion of unallocated addresses under that version while ipv4 and ipv6 will coexist for some period of time eventually all internet users and companies will need to transition to ipv6 while akamai has been developing plans for the transition to ipv6 and ensuring that we are prepared to meet our customers’ needs for both ipv4 and ipv6based technology there is no guarantee that such plans will be effective if we are unable to obtain the ipv4 addresses we need on financial terms acceptable to us or at all before we or other entities that rely on the internet can transition to ipv6 our current and future operations could be materially harmed if there is not a timely and successful transition to ipv6 by internet users generally the internet could function less effectively which could damage numerous businesses the economy generally and the prospects for future growth of the internet as a medium for transacting business this could in turn be harmful to our financial condition and results of operation 

as part of our business strategy we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations acquisitions and other strategic relationships that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 

we have completed numerous acquisitions in recent years if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases acquisitions and combinations are accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with a future acquisition or combination if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or combinations that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result in addition future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities we may also enter into other types of strategic relationships that involve technology sharing or close cooperation with other companies such relationships can be distracting to management and require the investment of significant amounts of money without a guaranteed return on investment or realization of significant or any benefits 

our stock price has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results in us dollar terms 

a portion of our revenues arises from international operations revenues generated and expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are often denominated in the currencies of the local countries as a result our consolidated us dollar financial statements are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates as the financial results of our international subsidiaries are translated from local currencies into us dollars in addition our financial results are subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in nonlocal currencies 

a substantial portion of our marketable securities are invested in auction rate securities continued failures in the auctions for these securities may affect our liquidity 

we held 1508 million in par value of auction rate securities or ars as of december 31 2010 which represented approximately 15 of our total short and longterm marketable securities of 1012 million as of 

  

that date ars are securities that are structured to allow for shortterm interest rate resets but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years at the end of each reset period which typically occurs every seven to 35 days investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par beginning in february 2008 the majority of ars in the marketplace including the ars that we hold in our portfolio failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders such failures resulted in the interest rate on these ars resetting to predetermined rates in accordance with the underlying loan agreement which might be lower than the current market rate of interest in the event we need to liquidate our investments in these types of securities including for purposes of funding our operations we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments in which demand equals or exceeds the supply of such securities being offered the issuer redeems the outstanding securities a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities mature or there is a default requiring immediate payment from the issuer these alternative liquidation measures may require that we sell our ars at a substantial discount to par value in the future should the ars we hold be subject to prolonged auction failures and we determine that the decline in value of ars is otherthantemporary we would recognize a loss in our consolidated statement of operations which could be material in addition any future failed auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of our investments and our ability to fund our operations furthermore if one or more of the issuers of the ars held in our portfolio are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through additional impairment charges which could be material we may also incur significant legal and related expenses in connection with efforts to require one or more of the investment advisors that sold us ars to provide liquidity for these securities there can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located this affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we compensate our officers and employees in part through equity incentives including stock options some of these stock options held by our officers and employees have exercise prices in excess of the current market price of our common stock which has diminished the retentive value of such options the loss of the services of any of our key employees could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology 

we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

   

  

 if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention of our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable developments and changes in patent law such as changes in interpretations of the joint infringement standard could also restrict how we enforce certain patents we hold monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use the value of our intellectual property assets may be reduced 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from mit technology that is covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

our business depends on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats if our legal right or technical ability to store and deliver content in one or more popular proprietary content formats such as adobe ® flash ® or windows ® media ®  was limited our ability to serve our customers in these formats would be impaired and the demand for our content delivery services would decline by customers using these formats owners of propriety content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are 

  

increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

if we seek to acquire significant businesses or technologies or require more cash to fund our future plans we may need to obtain funding from outside sources the current economic environment makes it difficult for companies to obtain financing particularly raising debt financing or implementing credit facilities therefore we may not be able to raise additional capital which could limit future actions we may want to take even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today or issue debt that places restrictions on our future activities we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 

changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business particularly the advertisingrelated services we have begun to offer it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

  

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection antidiscrimination and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services in addition domestic and international government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could negatively impact our business 

local tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes in those jurisdictions which could adversely affect our continued profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability as a government contractor we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable requirements then we could face penalties contract terminations and damage to our reputation we also may be required to devote substantial resources to the development and improvement of procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations 

global climate change could adversely impact our business 

recent scientific studies and other news reports suggest the possibility of global climate change in response governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources in addition our customers may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business our deployed network of tens of thousands of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels it is possible that future regulatory or legislative initiatives or customer demands could affect the costs of operating our network of servers and our other operations such costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenues and damage to our reputation 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

  

  

   

 in addition our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

a class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved 

we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we are also a nominal defendant in a related lawsuit alleging violations of section 16 of the securities exchange of 1934 as amended by such underwriters and our officers and directors see item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for more information any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition to ordinarycourse litigation we are a party to the litigation described below 

between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against 

  

the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of our board of directors authorized management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement that was subject to approval by the district court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement on june 25 2007 the district court signed an order terminating the settlement on august 25 2009 the plaintiffs filed a motion for final approval of a new proposed settlement among plaintiffs the underwriter defendants the issuer defendants and the insurers for the issuer defendants plan of distribution of the settlement fund and certification of the settlement classes on october 5 2009 the district court issued an opinion and order granting plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the settlement approval of the plan of distribution of the settlement fund and certification of the settlement classes an order and final judgment was entered on november 24 2009 notices of appeal of the district court’s october 5 2009 opinion and order have been filed in the united states court of appeals for the second circuit if the district court’s order is upheld on appeal we would have no material liability in connection with this litigation and this litigation would be resolved 

on or about october 3 2007 vanessa simmonds a purported akamai shareholder filed a complaint in the us district court for the western district of washington against the underwriters involved in our 1999 initial public offering of common stock alleging violations of section 16b of the exchange act of 1934 as amended the complaint alleges that the combined number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the lead underwriters and certain unnamed officers directors and principal shareholders exceeded ten percent of our outstanding common stock from the date of our initial public offering on october 29 1999 through at least october 28 2000 the complaint further alleges that those entities and individuals were thus subject to the reporting requirements of section 16a and the shortswing trading prohibition of section 16b and failed to comply with those provisions the complaint seeks to recover from the lead underwriters any “shortswing profits” obtained by them in violation of section 16b akamai was named as a nominal defendant in the action but has no liability for the asserted claims none of our directors or officers serving in such capacities at the time of our initial public offering are currently named as defendants in this action but there can be no guarantee that the complaint will not be amended or a new complaint or suit filed to name such directors or officers as defendants in this action or another action alleging a violation of the same provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended on march 12 2009 the court granted a joint motion by akamai and other issuer defendants to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that ms simmonds had failed to make an adequate demand on us prior to filing her complaint in its order the court stated it would not permit ms simmonds to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation because the court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction it did not specifically reach the issue of whether ms simmonds’ claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations however the court also granted a joint motion to dismiss by the underwriter defendants in the action with respect to cases involving nonmoving issuers holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers’ shareholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit ms simmonds appealed on december 2 2010 the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court’s decision to dismiss the moving issuers’ cases including akamai’s on the grounds that plaintiff’s demand letters were insufficient to put the issuers on notice of the claims asserted against them and further ordered that the dismissals be made with prejudice the ninth circuit however reversed and remanded the district court’s decision on the underwriters’ motion to dismiss as to the claims arising from the nonmoving issuers’ ipos finding plaintiff’s claims were not timebarred under the applicable statute of limitations on january 18 2011 the ninth circuit 

  

denied various parties’ petitions for rehearing and for rehearing en banc but stayed its rulings to allow for appeals to the united states supreme court we currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum in recent years however we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly annual or longer periods our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to price reductions and customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions that our existing customers purchase at the same time we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions or divestitures that may be announced after the date hereof

overview of financial results 

our increase in net income in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2008 reflects the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

 

   

we were profitable for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 based on our analysis of among other things the aforementioned trends and events as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2011 however our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including generating positive net income in any future period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities capitalized internaluse software costs goodwill and other intangible assets tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the 

  

circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe for each respective element including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe thirdparty evidence or tpe of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element we use the best estimate of selling price or besp to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method 

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we 

  

record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities 

effective january 1 2008 we implemented a thennewlyrequired accounting standard related to fair value measurement for our financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at least 

  

annually the guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the fair value measurement guidance fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

included in our longterm marketable securities at december 31 2010 are auction rate securities or ars that are primarily aaarated bonds which are all collateralized by federallyguaranteed student loans at december 31 2009 our short and longterm marketable securities included ars ars are longterm variable rate bonds tied to shortterm interest rates that may reset through a “dutch auction” process that is designed to occur every seven to 35 days historically the carrying value par value of ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates beginning in midfebruary 2008 and continuing throughout the period ended december 31 2010 however the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful as a result the interest rates on ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements we will not be able to liquidate affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer or the securities mature 

in light of these liquidity issues we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december 31 2010 assumed a weighted average discount rate of 321 and expected term of five years the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaarated ars market the expected term was based on management’s estimate of future liquidity as a result as of december 31 2010 we have estimated an aggregate pretax loss of 135 million which was related to the impairment of ars not deemed to be otherthantemporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity 

despite the failed auctions we continue to receive cash flows in the form of specified interest payments from the issuers of ars in addition we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the ars prior to a recovery of par value and currently intend to hold the investments until such time because we believe we have sufficient cash and other marketable securities onhand and from projected cash flows from operations see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

  

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such dates and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

loss contingencies 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose the nature of these loss contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

tax reserves 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have net deferred tax assets comprised of nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

  

uncertainty in income taxes are recognized in our financial statements under guidance that prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement as of december 31 2010 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 151 million including accrued interest and penalties 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units related to such awards we measure the fair value at the grant date and we recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 

for stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units that contain only a servicebased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards’ vesting period for awards with a performance conditionbased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting period commencing when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs as well as stockbased compensation expense of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

results of operations 

revenues total revenues increased 19 or 1638 million to 10236 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 8598 million for the year ended december 31 2009 total revenues increased 9 or 688 million to 8598 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 7909 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services during each of the last several years we expect this trend to continue in 2011 but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and a leveling off of the rate of increased growth in use of the internet as of december 31 2010 we had 3483 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 3122 at december 31 2009 and 2858 at december 31 2008 

  

a significant portion of the increase in revenues for 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven by traffic growth from our customers in our media and entertainment vertical revenues from this traffic growth were partially offset by reduced prices charged to our customers the increase in revenues from our commerce and enterprise customers for 2010 as compared to 2009 was principally due to increased purchases of valueadded services in our high tech vertical we experienced an increase in traffic growth as well as an increase in demand for our application performance solution services the increase in revenues from public sector customers was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and government contracts growth in our commerce vertical contributed to a large portion of our revenue growth for 2009 as compared to 2008 this was attributable to our acquisition of acerno and its advertising services customer base in late 2008 our new advertising decision solutions service offering contributed 231 million to such revenue growth the balance of the increased revenues from our commerce customers as well as enterprise customers was principally due to increased purchases of valueadded services such as our application performance solution services the increase in revenues from customers in our high tech vertical was primarily driven by increases in the amount of traffic we delivered while we also experienced increased traffic from customers in our media and entertainment vertical the revenues from this traffic growth were offset by reduced prices charged to our customers the increase in revenues from public sector customers was primarily attributed to the addition of new customers the following table quantifies the contribution to growth in revenues from different industry verticals in which we sell our services in millions 

 

 for 2010 2009 and 2008 28 28 and 25 respectively of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 17 18 and 18 of total revenues for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively was derived from operations in europe other than the united states no single country accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues during these periods we expect international sales as a percentage of our total sales in 2011 to remain consistent as compared to 2010 

resellers accounted for 18 of total revenues in 2010 18 in 2009 and 16 in 2008 for 2010 2009 and 2008 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

  

cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions 

 

 cost of revenues increased 21 or 535 million to 3034 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2499 million for the year ended december 31 2009 cost of revenues increased 12 or 273 million to 2499 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2226 million for the year ended december 31 2008 in each instance these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit an increase in colocation costs as we deployed more servers and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internaluse software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure additionally in each of 2010 2009 and 2008 cost of revenues included stockbased compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation such expense increased by 17 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 20 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 cost of revenues during each of 2010 2009 and 2008 also included credits received of approximately 71 million 35 million and 33 million respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any are unpredictable 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers as of december 31 2010 our current minimum commitments for the years ending december 31 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 were approximately 721 million 68 million 09 million 43000 and 32000 respectively 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 we expect to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and colocation fees however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally for 2011 we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for research and development personnel who design develop test deploy and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized software development costs of 311 million 258 million and 239 million respectively net of impairments these development costs consisted of external consulting payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we capitalized as internaluse software 76 million 62 million and 74 million respectively of noncash stockbased compensation we amortize these capitalized internaluse software costs to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

  

research and development expenses increased 25 or 111 million to 548 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 437 million for the year ended december 31 2009 research and development expenses increased 11 or 44 million to 437 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 392 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in research and development expenses in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to increases in payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation partially offset by higher capitalized salaries the increase in research and development expenses in 2009 as compared to 2008 was also due to increases in payroll and related costs partially offset by higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stockbased compensation expense the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased 26 or 473 million to 2267 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 1794 million for the year ended december 31 2009 sales and marketing expenses increased 9 or 151 million to 1794 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 1644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and sales support personnel attributable to revenue growth and an increase in stockbased compensation marketing and related costs and an increase in other expenses such as travel costs which was partially offset by a reduction in training and conference costs the increase in sales and marketing expenses during 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs in 2009 these increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing and related costs as well as a decrease in other expenses such as travel costs as compared to 2008 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

   

we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2011 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in the number of our sales and marketing personnel 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 general and administrative expenses increased 15 or 217 million to 1678 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 1461 million for the year ended december 31 2009 general and administrative expenses increased 7 or 101 million to 1461 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 1360 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth an increase in stockbased compensation facilitiesrelated costs and other expenses such as noncapitializable equipment purchases and maintenance these increases were partially offset by reductions in the provision for doubtful accounts during 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth additionally facilitiesrelated costs and amortization of leasehold improvements increased as a result of office expansions the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was also attributable to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts these increases were offset by a reduction in legal fees during 2009 as compared to 2008 

the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

   

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets remained consistent at 167 million for each of the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 amortization of other intangible assets increased 20 or 28 million to 167 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 139 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2009 as compared to 2008 was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of acerno in november 2008 based on current circumstances amortization expense is expected to be approximately 169 million 159 million 131 million 76 million and 51 million for the years ending december 31 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income decreased 22 or 35 million to 122 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 156 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest income decreased 37 or 91 million to 156 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 248 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decreases in 2010 as compared to 2009 and in 2009 as compared to 2008 were primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments during the comparable periods 

interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense decreased 40 or 11 million to 17 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 28 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense remained consistent at 28 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1 convertible senior notes the decrease in interest expense in 2010 resulted from the conversion of common stock of an aggregate of 1998 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible notes as of december 31 2010 we had no outstanding interestbearing indebtedness requiring the payment of interest 

other expense income net other expense income net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred gains from legal settlements and other nonoperating expense income items other expense income net decreased 26 million to 25 million of expense for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 02 million of income for the year ended december 31 2009 other income net decreased 65 or 03 million to 02 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 05 million for the year ended december 31 2008 other expense income net for the year ended december 31 2010 consisted of foreign exchange losses other income net for the year ended december 31 2009 consisted of 08 million of gains on legal settlements and 11 million of gains on divesture of certain assets offset by 17 million of foreign exchange losses other income net for the year ended december 31 2008 consisted mostly of foreign exchange gains other expense income net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 

gain loss on investments net during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded a net gain on investments of 04 million primarily related to the sale of marketable securities additionally during 2010 we recorded a gain of 96 million due to a decrease in the otherthantemporary impairment of certain ars and a loss of 96 million on a put option related to our ars holdings during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a net gain on investments of 08 million which primarily related to an unrealized gain of 33 million from a decrease in the otherthantemporary impairment of certain marketable securities and an unrealized loss of 29 million on a put option related to our ars holdings during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a net loss on investments of 02 million which reflects a loss of 129 million due to otherthantemporary impairments on certain marketable securities a gain of 125 million realized on a put option related to our ars received from one of our investment advisors in november 2008 and a gain of 02 million on the sale of marketable securities 

  

loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 03 million as a result of early conversions of 1517 million in principal of our 1 convertible notes into shares of our common stock 

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2010 our effective tax rate of 347 was lower than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to benefit recorded for research and development tax credits partially offset by the state income taxes for the years ended december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 our effective tax rates of 385 and 381 respectively were higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 

provision for income taxes remained consistent at 912 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 913 million for the year ended december 31 2009 provision for income taxes increased by 2 or 19 million to 913 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 894 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the slight decrease from 2009 to 2010 was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate offset by an increase in operating income the increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in our operating income 

while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2011 to remain relatively consistent with 2010 this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stockbased compensation or any potential tax planning strategies our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options further our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies in 2010 due to our continued utilization of available nols and tax credit carryforwards our tax payments were significantly lower than our recorded income tax provision we expect to utilize substantially all of our tax credit carryforwards in 2011 once we have done so the amount of cash tax payments we make will increase over those made in previous years 

in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

nongaap measures 

in addition to the traditional financial measurements that are reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap we also compile and monitor certain nongaap financial measures related to the performance of our business we typically discuss the nongaap financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls a “nongaap financial measure” is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 

  

we believe that making available the nongaap financial measures described below helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects especially when comparing such results to previous periods forecasts or competitors’ financial statements our management uses these nongaap measures in addition to gaap financial measures as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors these measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

we consider fullytaxed normalized net income and fullytaxed normalized net income per diluted common share to be important indicators of our overall performance as they eliminate the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are noncash we define fullytaxed normalized net income as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding the following pretax items amortization of other acquired intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits acquisition related costs benefits certain gains and losses on investments and loss on early extinguishment of debt 

the following table reconciles gaap net income to fullytaxed normalized net income and fullytaxed normalized net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

  

 we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of our operational strength and the performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay we define adjusted ebitda as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding interest income taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits acquisition related costs benefits certain gains and losses on investments foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains or losses on legal settlements 

  

the following table reconciles gaap net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 these nongaap financial measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities proceeds from exercise of stock awards and cash generated by operations 

as of december 31 2010 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate debt securities united states treasury and government agency securities commercial paper corporate debt securities and student loanbacked ars totaled 12434 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

we held approximately 1508 million and 2749 million in par value of ars at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively ars are primarily aaarated bonds most of which are guaranteed by the us government as part of the federal family education loan program through the us department of education none of the ars in our portfolio are mortgagebacked or collateralized debt obligations in midfebruary 2008 all of our ars experienced failed auctions which failures continued throughout the period ended december 31 2010 as a result we have been unable to liquidate most of our holdings of ars based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in 2011 or in the foreseeable future in november 2008 we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors that provided for the repurchase beginning on june 30 2010 of all of the ars we purchased through such financial advisor if we have been unable to achieve liquidity with respect to such securities before that time in early july 2010 we exercised our put right under the agreement and the investment advisor repurchased 305 million of ars at par value 

  

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 220 million to 4025 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 4244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the change in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared the year ended december 31 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net income and depreciation and amortization expense offset by an increase in working capital an increase in our excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and a decrease in our provision for deferred income taxes cash provided by operating activities increased by 809 million to 4244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 3435 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we expect that cash provided by operating activities will increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates 

net cash used in investing activities was 3354 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 3575 million for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 3644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 cash used in investing activities for 2010 reflects purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 11465 million purchases of property and equipment of 1920 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs cash paid for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of velocitude of 127 million and an increase in other investments of 05 million amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 10158 million cash used in investing activities for 2009 reflects a 58 million earnout payment associated with our purchase of acerno purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 7904 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1081 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 5451 million net cash used in investing activities for 2008 reflects the purchase of acerno in november 2008 for 837 million purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 5331 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1154 million including capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by the proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 3677 million for 2011 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately 16 of total revenue for the year we expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations 

cash used in financing activities was 177 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 425 million used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 cash provided by financing activities was 331 million for the year ended december 31 2008 cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2010 consisted of 924 million related to a common stock repurchase program we initiated in april 2009 and extended in april 2010 this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2010 which included proceeds of 458 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 290 million related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2009 consisted of 665 million related to a common stock repurchase program we initiated in april 2009 this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 which included proceeds of 217 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 22 million related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 included proceeds of 220 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 112 million related to excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

  

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt and equity repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 

 as part of an agreement entered into with one of our investment advisors under which it agreed to repurchase all of our ars held with that investment advisor beginning on june 30 2010 if we had been unable to achieve liquidity with respect to such ars before then we were also offered the ability to enter into a line of credit that would be collateralized by the underlying ars investments in january 2009 the line of credit was approved by the investment advisor in early july 2010 we exercised our put right under the agreement and the investment advisor repurchased 305 million of ars at the par value the unused letter of credit has expired 

we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change if we are unable to liquidate our marketable securities or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities we may not however be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of additional factors that could affect our liquidity 

  

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2010 for the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 

 in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2010 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 151 million which included 43 million of accrued interest and penalties we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2011 we are not however able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding 53 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases approximately 03 million and 45000 of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities and are classified as shortterm and longterm marketable securities respectively on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through august 2014 the remaining 50 million of irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

litigation 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on litigation 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2009 the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables this guidance provides an alternative method for establishing the selling price for a deliverable when vsoe or thirdparty evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined companies will be required to develop an estimate of the selling price for separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method we have elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2010 on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after january 1 2010 to date we have been able to determine the selling price for each element in multiple element arrangements based on vsoe for each respective element specifically the selling price is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately or based on the renewal rate for services contractually offered to the customer as a result the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition is not expected to have a significant effect on revenues in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on current gotomarket strategies due to the existence of vsoe across our service offerings 

in october 2009 the fasb issued an accounting standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements this standard amends previously issued guidance to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality entities that sell joint hardware and software products that meet the exception will be required to follow the guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 early adoption and retrospective application are also permitted we have elected to early adopt this guidance beginning january 1 2010 as a result the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard update for business combinations specifically related to the disclosures of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations this guidance specifies that pro forma disclosures should be reported as if the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period and the pro forma disclosures must include a description of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments this standard will be effective for business combinations with an acquisition date of january 1 2011 or later the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio in our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments we place our investments with high quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds united states treasury obligations highquality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

at december 31 2010 we held 1508 million in par value of ars that have experienced failed auctions which has prevented us from liquidating those investments due to these liquidity issues we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments such analysis considered the timing of expected future successful auctions the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december 31 2010 assumed a weighted average discount rate of 321 and expected term of five years the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for recent debt offerings the expected term was based on management’s estimate of future liquidity as a result as of december 31 2010 we have estimated an aggregate pretax loss of 135 million which related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity the impact for the year ended december 31 2010 was a pretax gain of 72 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity related to ars having impairments deemed to be temporary the aggregate gain in the fair value of ars experienced in the year ended december 31 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used in the computation of fair values from 398 used as of december 31 2009 to 321 used as of december 31 2010 

our valuation of the ars is sensitive to market conditions and management’s judgment and could change significantly based on the assumptions used if as of december 31 2010 we had used a term of three years or seven years and discount rate of 321 the gross unrealized loss on the 1508 million in par value of ars classified as availableforsale would have been 90 million or 201 million respectively if we had used a term of five years and discount rate of 221 or 421 the gross unrealized loss on the 1508 million in par value of ars classified as availableforsale would have been 66 million or 201 million respectively 

during november 2008 we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors providing for it to repurchase the ars held through such advisor at par value beginning on june 30 2010 if we were unable to liquidate such ars before that date the ars covered by this agreement had a par value of 305 million at june 30 2010 at any time during the period up until june 2010 our investment advisor could have called the ars at par value but did not do so in early july 2010 we exercised the put option incorporated in the agreement and the investment advisor repurchased 305 million of our ars holdings at par value we elected to apply the fair value option permitted under the relevant accounting standard to the put option the fair value of the put option was determined by comparing the fair values of the related ars as described above to their par values and also considered the credit risk associated with our investment advisor as of december 31 2009 the fair value of the put option was 96 million during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded a loss of 96 million which offset the related ars gain of 96 million included in gain loss on investments net in the consolidated statement of operations 

we have operations in europe asia australia and india as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates additionally we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations we do not have any foreign currency hedge contracts

meeting the challenges of the internet 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other entities conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the challenges inherent in delivering content over the internet are compounded by the internal technology challenges facing enterprises driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives for example many companies use the internet as a key marketing tool for product launches distribution of promotional videos or contests these onetime events may draw millions of visitors to a company’s website over a brief period of time so the enterprise must have in place the capacity to deal with a flood of visitors seeking to view content or use applications at the same time budget limitations may preclude a company from putting in place extensive internal infrastructure knowing that it will not always need such capacity in addition as reliance on the internet has become more pervasive website operators have been experiencing higher levels of traffic to their sites on a constant basis which place extensive demands on infrastructure 

to address these challenges we have developed solutions designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations we particularly seek to address the following market needs 

superior performance  commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers transact business and provide information about themselves if however a company’s internet site fails to provide visitors with a fast and dependable experience they will likely abandon that site potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the enterprise’s reputation through a combination of people processes and technology we help our customers improve the scalability and predictability of their websites without the need for them to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have a presence in more than 900 networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the “edge” of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations for our customers at the same time our customers have access to control features to enable them to provide content to end users that is current and customized for visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world 

scalability  we believe that scalability is one of the keys to reliability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites and almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points during the day with the proliferation of hd video and other types of rich content enterprises of all types must be able to cope with rapidly increasing numbers of requests for bandwidthintensive digital media assets and the storage of those assets in all of these instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions to meet such peaks and valleys with more than 60000 servers deployed worldwide managed 

  

by our proprietary software technology our network is designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned traffic peaks and related storage needs without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an ondemand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure 

security security is one of the most significant challenges facing use of the internet for business and government processes security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can impact every measure of performance including information security speed reliability and customer confidence unlike traditional security strategies that can negatively impact performance akamai’s approach is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance may not be compromised perhaps most significantly our distributed network of tens of thousands of servers is designed to eliminate a single point of failure and can reduce the impact of security attacks 

functionality websites have become increasingly dynamic complex and sophisticated to meet these challenges we have added solutions through both internal investment and acquisitions these solutions have included services designed to help our customers accelerate dynamic content and applications more effectively manage their online media assets and improve the quality of their online advertising initiatives 

our core solutions 

we offer application performance services services and solutions for digital media and software distribution and storage content and application delivery online advertisingrelated services and other specialized internetbased offerings

ip application accelerator 

with a growing global workforce accessing ipbased applications online and from mobile devices enterprises that rely on such applications find high quality and performance to be crucial examples of ipbased applications include voice over ip calling email hosting services and sales order processing tools while enterprises have been using the internet to support communication needs for webbased applications for some time businesses are increasingly relying on the internet to support connection needs for ipbased applications akamai’s ip application accelerator solution is designed to address core internet weaknesses to optimize the performance availability and realtime sensitivity associated with ipenabled applications delivered over internetrelated protocols such as ssl ipsec udp and ftp ip application accelerator uses akamai’s global network of servers and optimized routing and connection technologies to improve the stability and reliability of connections between end users and the ipbased application

sales service and marketing 

our sales and service professionals are located in more than 20 offices in the united states europe and asia we market and sell our services and solutions domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 100 active channel partners including electronic data systems corporation ibm corporation verizon and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketingfocused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers sales agents and referral partners by aligning with these companies we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows strategic alliances and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2009 we had 87 employees in our global marketing organization which is a component of our sales and support organization

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of our competitors also resell our services other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externallymanaged services like akamai 

with respect to our ads offerings we compete with a range of other companies that provide targeted advertising solutions at the same time some of the companies that offer competitive solutions have entered into strategic agreements with us that we believe are mutually beneficial we compete on the basis of our technology the availability of our data cooperative our predictive analytics capabilities the ability to leverage existing business relationships and price 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and price 

  

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content and application delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had a total of approximately 1750 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with innovative approaches and established companies with greater resources 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do other competitors may attract customers by offering lesssophisticated versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge given the relative ease with which some customers can potentially switch to another content delivery network provider any differentiated offerings or lower pricing by competitors could lead to a rapid loss of customers our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements in addition current or potential competitors may bundle their offerings with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer some of our existing resellers are competitors if one or more resellers that generate substantial revenues for us were to terminate our relationship and become a competitor or a reseller for a competitor our business could be adversely affected 

in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai as a result our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased it is an important component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and government agencies about our services and convince them to entrust their content and applications to an external service provider and akamai in particular if we are unsuccessful in such efforts our business could suffer 

ultimately increased competition of all types could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve 

in recent quarters we have lowered the prices we charge many of our customers for our content delivery services in order to remain competitive this has been particularly true for the digital media services consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes in addition our operating expenses have increased on an absolute basis in each of 2007 2008 and 2009 if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to new or existing content delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

our revenue growth rate declined in 2009 as compared to recent prior years due to a number of factors including increasing competition the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and macroeconomic factors affecting certain aspects of our business given the continuing relevance of such factors and other potential events and circumstances such as those described below we may not be able to accelerate our revenue growth rate in 2010 or future years in addition revenues in each of the first three quarters of 2009 were lower than our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 we may experience quarteroverquarter revenue declines in the future we also believe our operating margins will decrease in 2010 because we have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative and other expenses as a result we may not be able to continue to maintain our current level of profitability in 2010 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 

there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor worldwide economy has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows in particular weakness in the online advertising market has affected and could continue to affect the success of our internet advertisingrelated initiatives and could have a negative impact on our media and other customers to the extent customers are 

  

unable to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver on their behalf such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss slow down in commerce over the internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions which in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

our failure to manage expected growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

we have continued to grow diversify and evolve our business both in the united states and internationally it is unclear however whether such growth will continue in the event of a slowing or decline in our rate of growth we must also address the challenges of establishing an appropriate organizational size while maintaining the quality of our services as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters if we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or to anticipate our future personnel needs our business may be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to effectively manage our technical support infrastructure we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services or attacks on our internal information technology systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard affected customers will be entitled to credits our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services 

  

such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users in addition there have been and in the future may be attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems in order to steal information about our technology financial data or other information or take other actions that would be damaging to us although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions and security breaches there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation any successful breach of the security of our information systems could lead to the unauthorized release of valuable confidential information including trade secrets material nonpublic information about our financial condition and sensitive data that others could use to compete against us such consequences would likely harm our business and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and server capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers in addition our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers’ traffic particularly in the event of unexpected surges in hd video traffic we believe that absent extraordinary circumstances we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer we may not be able to deploy on a timely basis enough servers to meet the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the functioning of those servers in addition damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

as part of our business strategy we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 

we have completed numerous acquisitions in recent years if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases acquisitions and combinations are accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with a future acquisition or combination if we are not successful in completing acquisitions or combinations that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result in addition future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities 

our stock price has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

if we are unable to continue to innovate and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions for example individuals are increasingly using mobile devices to access internet content our ability to provide new and innovative solutions to address challenges posed by mobile users and other developments is important to our future growth other companies are also looking to offer internetrelated solutions such as cloud computing to generate growth these other companies may develop technological or business model innovations in the markets we seek to address that are or are perceived to be equivalent or superior to our services in addition our customers’ business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers’ needs for our services our operating results depend on our ability to adapt to market changes and develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources in 2009 we launched the akamai hd network a new approach to delivering hd video over the internet that we view as important to our future success if our services utilizing the akamai hd network or other new services do not operate as expected or there is a lack of or delay in market acceptance of such services we could experience increased expenses loss of market share and decreasing revenues and earnings 

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets 

  

and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results 

a substantial portion of our marketable securities are invested in auction rate securities continued failures in the auctions for these securities may affect our liquidity 

we held 2749 million in par value of auction rate securities or ars as of december 31 2009 which represented approximately 31 of our total short and longterm marketable securities of 8802 million as of that date ars are securities that are structured to allow for shortterm interest rate resets but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years at the end of each reset period which typically occurs every seven to 35 days investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par beginning in february 2008 the majority of ars in the marketplace including the ars that we hold in our portfolio failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders such failures resulted in the interest rate on these ars resetting to predetermined rates in accordance with the underlying loan agreement which might be lower than the current market rate of interest in the event we need to liquidate our investments in these types of securities including for purposes of funding our operations we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments in which demand equals or exceeds the supply of such securities being offered the issuer redeems the outstanding securities a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities mature or there is a default requiring immediate payment from the issuer these alternative liquidation measures may require that we sell our ars at a substantial discount to par value in the future should the ars we hold be subject to prolonged auction failures and we determine that the decline in value of ars is otherthantemporary we would recognize a loss in our consolidated statement of operations which could be material in addition any future failed auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of our investments and our ability to fund our operations furthermore if one or more of the issuers of the ars held in our portfolio are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through additional impairment charges which could be material we may also incur significant legal and related expenses in connection with efforts to require one or more of the investment advisors that sold us ars to provide liquidity for these securities there can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is significant competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located this affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we compensate our officers and employees in part through equity incentives including stock options a significant portion of these stock options held by our officers and employees have exercise prices in excess of the current market price of our common stock which has diminished the retentive value of such options the loss of the services of any of our key employees could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

  

we may need to defend against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology 

we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights but have not always prevailed such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention of our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from mit technology that is covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

our business depends on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats if our legal right or technical ability to store and deliver content in one or more popular proprietary content formats such as adobe ® flash ® or windows ® media ®  was limited our ability to serve our customers in these formats would be impaired and the demand for our content delivery services would decline by customers using these formats owners of propriety content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

as of december 31 2009 we had outstanding 1998 million in principal amount of our 1 senior convertible notes due 2033 the holders of such notes will have the right to require the repayment of some or all of the principal amount of the notes on specified dates beginning in december 2010 due to these repayment provisions as of december 31 2009 the principal amount of the notes has been classified on our balance sheet as shortterm if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes if we are unable to make interest or principal payments on such notes or other indebtedness when due we would be in default under the terms of our debt obligations which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which in turn would seriously harm our business we may seek to refinance our 1 senior convertible notes any such refinancing could be on less advantageous terms than those applying to our existing notes 

if we are required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

if we seek to acquire significant businesses or technologies or require more cash to fund our future plans we may need to obtain funding from outside sources the current economic environment makes it difficult for 

  

companies to obtain financing particularly raising debt financing or implementing credit facilities therefore we may not be able to raise additional capital which could limit future actions we may want to take even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today or issue debt that places restrictions on our future activities we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 

changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business particularly the advertisingrelated services we have begun to offer it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection antidiscrimination and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours the adoption of any of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services in addition congress has been contemplating net neutrality legislation the scope and impact of any such legislation is unpredictable but could potentially have an adverse effect on our business and operations other domestic and international government attempts to regulate the operation of the internet could also negatively impact our business 

local tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes in those jurisdictions which could adversely affect our continued profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to cover our total actual liability as a government contractor we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable requirements then we could face penalties contract terminations and damage to our reputation we also may be required to devote substantial resources to the development and improvement of procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations 

global climate change could adversely impact our business 

recent scientific studies and other news reports suggest the possibility of global climate change in response governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of 

  

alternative fuel sources in addition our customers may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business our deployed network of tens of thousands of servers consumes significant energy resources including those generated by the burning of fossil fuels it is possible that future regulatory or legislative initiatives or customer demands could affect the costs of operating our network of servers and our other operations such costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more efficient could make us less profitable in future periods failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines lost revenues and damage to our reputation 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors further as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

a class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved 

we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we are also a nominal defendant in a related lawsuit alleging violations of section 16 of the securities exchange of 1934 as amended by such underwriters and our officers and directors see item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for more information any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition to ordinarycourse litigation we are a party to the litigation described below 

between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of our board of directors authorized management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement that was subject to approval by the district court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement on june 25 2007 the district court signed an order terminating the settlement on august 25 2009 the plaintiffs filed a motion for final approval of a new proposed settlement among plaintiffs the underwriter defendants the issuer defendants and the insurers for the issuer defendants plan of distribution of the settlement fund and certification of the settlement classes on october 5 2009 the district court issued an opinion and order granting plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the settlement approval of the plan of distribution of the settlement fund and certification of the settlement classes an order and final judgment was entered on november 24 2009 notices of appeal of the district court’s october 5 2009 opinion and order have been filed in the united states court of appeals for the second circuit if the district court’s order is upheld on appeal we would have no material liability in connection with this litigation and this litigation would be resolved 

on or about october 3 2007 vanessa simmonds a purported akamai shareholder filed a complaint in the us district court for the western district of washington against the underwriters involved in our 1999 initial public offering of common stock alleging violations of section 16b of the exchange act of 1934 as amended 

  

the complaint alleges that the combined number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the lead underwriters and certain unnamed officers directors and principal shareholders exceeded ten percent of our outstanding common stock from the date of our initial public offering on october 29 1999 through at least october 28 2000 the complaint further alleges that those entities and individuals were thus subject to the reporting requirements of section 16a and the shortswing trading prohibition of section 16b and failed to comply with those provisions the complaint seeks to recover from the lead underwriters any “shortswing profits” obtained by them in violation of section 16b akamai was named as a nominal defendant in the action but has no liability for the asserted claims none of our directors or officers serving in such capacities at the time of our initial public offering are currently named as defendants in this action but there can be no guarantee that the complaint will not be amended or a new complaint or suit filed to name such directors or officers as defendants in this action or another action alleging a violation of the same provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended on march 12 2009 the court granted a joint motion by akamai and other issuer defendants to dismiss the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that ms simmonds had failed to make an adequate demand on us prior to filing her complaint in its order the court stated it would not permit ms simmonds to amend her demand letters while pursuing her claims in the litigation because the court dismissed the case on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction it did not specifically reach the issue of whether ms simmonds’ claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations however the court also granted a joint motion to dismiss by the underwriter defendants in the action with respect to cases involving nonmoving issuers holding that the cases were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the issuers’ shareholders had notice of the potential claims more than five years prior to filing suit ms simmonds filed a notice of appeal on april 10 2009 we currently believe that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum in recent years however we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly twelvemonth or longer periods our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions that our existing customers purchase at the same time we must manage the rate of growth in our expenses as we invest in strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate future revenue growth accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 

our increase in net income in 2009 as compared to 2008 and 2007 reflects the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while effectively managing the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

 

   

we were profitable for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 based on our analysis of among other things the aforementioned trends and events as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2010 however our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including generating positive net income in any future period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities capitalized internaluse software costs goodwill and other intangible assets tax reserves impairment and useful lives of longlived assets loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

definitions 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element’s relative fair value fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately or based on the renewal rate for service contractually offered to the customer 

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

  

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred integration and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cashbasis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses increases in the reserve for cashbasis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cashbasis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities 

effective january 1 2008 we implemented a thennewlyrequired accounting standard related to fair value measurement for our financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at least annually the guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the fair value measurement guidance fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the 

  

financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

included in our short and longterm marketable securities at december 31 2009 and 2008 are auction rate securities or ars that are primarily aaarated bonds most of which are collateralized by federallyguaranteed student loans ars are longterm variable rate bonds tied to shortterm interest rates that may reset through a “dutch auction” process that is designed to occur every seven to 35 days historically the carrying value par value of ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates beginning in midfebruary 2008 and continuing throughout the period ended december 31 2009 however the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful as a result the interest rates on ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements we will not be able to liquidate affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer or the securities mature 

in light of these liquidity issues we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december 31 2009 assumed a weighted average discount rate of 398 and expected term of five years the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaarated ars market the expected term was based on management’s estimate of future liquidity as a result as of december 31 2009 we have estimated an aggregate loss of 304 million of which 208 million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity and of which 96 million was related to the impairment of ars deemed otherthantemporary and included in gain loss on investments net in our 2009 and 2008 consolidated statements of operations on a cumulative basis 

despite the failed auctions we continue to receive cash flows in the form of specified interest payments from the issuers of ars in addition except for ars with respect to which we have entered into an agreement allowing us to sell such ars in june 2010 we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the ars prior to a recovery of par value and intend to hold the investments until such time because we believe we have sufficient cash and other marketable securities onhand and from projected cash flows from operations see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december 31 2009 and 2008 we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of december 31 2009 and 2008 these tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

loss contingencies 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

tax reserves 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have significant deferred tax assets comprised of nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

as of january 1 2007 we adopted a thennewlyrequired accounting standard related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements that guidance prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement as of the date of adoption we had unrecognized tax benefits of 21 million including accrued interest and penalties and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting the guidance as of december 31 2009 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 102 million including accrued interest and penalties 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units related to such awards we measure stockbased compensation at the grant date based 

  

on the fair value of the award and we recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options which could have a material impact on our financial statements judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted in addition for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense recorded and could materially impact our result of operations 

for stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units that contain only a servicebased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards’ vesting periods for those awards that contain only a service vesting feature for awards with a performance conditionbased vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting periods 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previouslydeveloped software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

results of operations 

revenues total revenues increased 9 or 688 million to 8598 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 7909 million for the year ended december 31 2008 total revenues increased 24 or 1545 million to 7909 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 6364 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increases in revenue over the years presented were primarily attributable to an increase in each of 2009 and 2008 in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers also contributing to increased revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008 were revenues generated through growth in our new advertising decision solutions service offering increased sales to existing customers contributed to increases in the average revenue per customer during each year partially offset by reduced unit prices offered to new and renewing customers we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services we expect this trend to continue in 2010 but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and a leveling off of the rate of increased growth in use of the internet as of december 31 2009 we had 3122 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 2858 at december 31 2008 and 2645 at december 31 2007 

for 2009 and 2008 28 and 25 respectively of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 18 of total revenues for each of the years was derived from operations in europe for 2007 23 of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 17 of total revenues was derived from operations in europe other than the united states no single country accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues during these periods we expect international sales to increase slightly as a percentage of our total sales in 2010 as compared to prior years 

  

resellers accounted for 18 of total revenues in 2009 16 in 2008 and 18 in 2007 for 2009 2008 and 2007 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions 

 

 cost of revenues increased 12 or 273 million to 2499 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2226 million for the year ended december 31 2008 cost of revenues increased 33 or 552 million to 2226 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1674 million for the year ended december 31 2007 in each instance these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internaluse software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure additionally in 2009 2008 and 2007 cost of revenues included stockbased compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation such expense increased by 20 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 and 15 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 cost of revenues during 2009 2008 and 2007 also included credits received of approximately 35 million 33 million and 34 million respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any will vary 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers for the years ending december 31 2010 and 2011 the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services are approximately 416 million and 40 million respectively 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 we expect to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally for 2010 we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for research and development personnel who design develop test deploy and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we capitalized software development costs of 258 million 239 million and 178 million respectively net of impairments these development costs consisted of external consulting payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 

  

2007 we capitalized as internaluse software 62 million 74 million and 64 million respectively of noncash stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

research and development expenses increased 11 or 44 million to 437 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 392 million for the year ended december 31 2008 research and development expenses decreased 11 or 49 million to 392 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 441 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in research and development expenses in 2009 as compared to 2008 was due to increases in payroll and related costs partially offset by higher capitalized salaries and a decrease in stockbased compensation expense the decrease in research and development expenses in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to decreases in stockbased compensation expense and an increase in amount of costs capitalized as internaluse software partially offset by an increase in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount 

the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased 9 or 151 million to 1794 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 1644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 sales and marketing expenses increased 11 or 168 million to 1644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1476 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increases in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and sales support personnel attributable to revenue growth in 2009 these increases were partially offset by a reduction in marketing and related costs as well as a decrease in other expenses such as travel costs as compared to 2008 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

   

we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2010 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services and an increase in payroll and related costs due to continued growth in our sales and marketing personnel 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 general and administrative expenses increased 7 or 101 million to 1461 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 1360 million for the year ended december 31 2008 general and administrative expenses increased 12 or 149 million to 1360 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1211 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in general and administrative expenses during both periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth additionally both facilitiesrelated costs and amortization of leasehold improvements increased as a result of office expansions the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was also attributable to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts these increases were offset by a reduction in legal fees during 2009 as compared to 2008 and a decrease in stockbased compensation expense during 2008 as compared to 2007 

the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring and an increase in rent and facilities costs 

  

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased 20 or 28 million to 167 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 139 million for the year ended december 31 2008 amortization of other intangible assets increased 22 or 25 million to 139 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 114 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2009 as compared to 2008 was due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of acerno in november 2008 the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of acerno in november 2008 and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the netli and red swoosh acquisitions in march and april 2007 respectively based on current circumstances amortization expense is expected to be approximately 164 million 164 million 154 million 126 million and 72 million for the years ending december 31 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income decreased 37 or 91 million to 156 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 248 million for the year ended december 31 2008 interest income decreased 4 or 10 million to 248 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 258 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decreases in 2009 as compared to 2008 and in 2008 as compared to 2007 were primarily due to a decrease in the interest rates offsetting higher cash and marketable securities balances driven by an increase in cash generated from our operations 

interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense remained consistent at 28 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 interest expense decreased 8 or 03 million to 28 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1 convertible senior notes based upon our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2009 we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations including deferred financing amortization will not exceed 29 million in 2010 

other income net other income net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains on legal settlements other income net decreased 65 or 03 million to 02 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 05 million for the year ended december 31 2008 other income net was 05 million for the year ended december 31 2007 other income net for the year ended december 31 2009 consisted of 08 million of gains on legal settlements and 11 million of gains on divesture of certain assets offset by 17 million of foreign exchange losses other income net for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 consisted mostly of foreign exchange gains and proceeds from legal settlements respectively other income net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 

gain loss on investments net during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a net gain on investments of 08 million which relates primarily to an unrealized gain of 33 million from a decrease in the otherthantemporary impairment of certain marketable securities and an unrealized loss of 29 million on a put option related to our auction rate securities holdings during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a net loss on investments of 02 million which reflects a loss of 129 million due to otherthantemporary impairments on certain marketable securities a gain of 125 million realized on a put option related to our auction rate securities received from one of our investment advisors in november 2008 and a gain of 02 million on the sale of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a net gain on investments of 24000 from the sale of marketable securities 

  

loss on early extinguishment of debt during 2007 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of 3000 as a result of conversions to common stock of 01 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible notes in august 2007 and 40000 in principal amount of such notes in january 2007 we did not record any loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the 2008 or 2009 

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 our effective tax rate of 385 was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits for the years ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 our effective tax rates of 381 and 400 respectively were higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 

provision for income taxes increased by 2 or 19 million to 913 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 894 million for the year ended december 31 2008 provision for income taxes increased by 33 or 222 million to 894 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 672 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these increases were primarily due to increases in our operating income 

while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2010 to remain relatively consistent with 2009 this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of stockbased compensation or any potential tax planning strategies our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options further our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies in 2009 due to our continued utilization of available net operating losses or nol and tax credit carryforwards our tax payments were significantly lower than our recorded income tax provision if we continue to generate taxable income at levels consistent with recent years we may utilize substantially all of our nol and tax credit carryforwards in 2010 or 2011 once we have done so the amount of cash tax payments we make will increase over those made in previous years 

in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

nongaap measures 

in addition to the traditional financial measurements that are reflected in our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we also compile and monitor certain nongaap financial measures related to the performance of our business we typically discuss the nongaap financial measures described below on our quarterly public earnings release calls a “nongaap financial measure” is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 

  

we believe that making available the nongaap financial measures described below helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects especially when comparing such results to previous periods forecasts or competitors our management uses these nongaap measures in addition to gaap financial measures as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors these measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking 

we consider normalized net income and normalized net income per diluted common share to be important indicators of our overall performance as they eliminate the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are noncash we define normalized net income as net income determined in accordance with gaap excluding amortization of other acquired intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits certain gains and losses on investments loss on early extinguishment of debt and the utilization of nol carryforwards and credits the weighted average shares used in the normalized net income per diluted common share calculation exclude the effect of stockbased compensation under the treasury stock method in 2009 we stopped calculating shares used in normalized net income per diluted share because the impact of this nongaap measure was no longer materially different from the gaap measurement of diluted weighted average shares 

the following table reconciles net income to normalized net income and net income per diluted share to normalized net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized internaluse software restructuring charges and benefits certain gains and losses on investments foreign exchange gains and losses loss on early extinguishment of debt gains or losses on legal settlements and utilization of nol carryforwards and credits 

  

the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 these nongaap financial measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities proceeds from exercise of stock awards and cash generated by operations 

as of december 31 2009 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate debt securities united states treasury and government agency securities commercial paper corporate debt securities and student loanbacked ars totaled 10615 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

we held approximately 2749 million and 2871 million in par value of ars at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the ars are primarily aaarated bonds most of which are guaranteed by the us government as part of the federal family education loan program through the us department of education none of the ars in our portfolio are mortgagebacked or collateralized debt obligations in midfebruary 2008 all of our ars experienced failed auctions which failures continued throughout the period ended december 31 2009 as a result we have been unable to liquidate most of our holdings of ars based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in 2010 in november 2008 we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors that provides for the repurchase in june 2010 of 762 million of the ars we hold if we have been unable to achieve liquidity with respect to such securities before that time 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 809 million to 4244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 3435 million for the year ended december 31 2008 cash provided by operating activities increased 1065 million to 3435 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2370 million for the year ended december 31 2007 we expect that cash provided by operating 

  

activities will continue to increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates 

net cash used in investing activities was 3575 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 3644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash used in investing activities was 2267 million for the year ended december 31 2007 cash used in investing activities for 2009 reflects a 58 million earnout payment associated with our purchase of acerno net purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 7904 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1081 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 5451 million net cash used in investing activities for 2008 reflects the purchase of acerno in november 2008 for 837 million net purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 5331 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1154 million including capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by the proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 3677 million net cash used in investing activities for 2007 reflects net purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 5506 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1005 million including capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 4158 million and 79 million of net cash acquired through our acquisitions of netli in march 2007 and red swoosh in april 2007 additionally net cash used in investing activities during 2007 included a decrease of 07 million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits for 2010 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately 15 of total revenue for the year we expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations 

cash used by financing activities was 425 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 331 million provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 cash provided by financing activities was 525 million for the year ended december 31 2007 cash used in financing activities for the yearended december 31 2009 consisted of 665 million related to a common stock repurchase program we initiated in april 2009 this amount was offset by cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2009 which included proceeds of 217 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and 22 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from exercises of stock options cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 included proceeds of 220 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 also included 112 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from exercises of stock options cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 included proceeds of 316 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercises of stock options and sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 also included 209 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from exercises of stock options 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

  

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 

 as part of an agreement entered into with one of our investment advisors under which it agreed to repurchase 762 million of our ars in june 2010 we were also offered the ability to enter into a line of credit that would be collateralized by the underlying ars investments in january 2009 the line of credit for 762 million was approved by the investment advisor we have not yet used the line of credit 

we believe based on our present business plan that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities we may not however be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of additional factors that could affect our liquidity 

  

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2009 for the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 

 our 1 convertible senior notes provide for the bondholders to redeem the bonds at par value plus accrued interest at various times the first redemption date is december 15 2010 based upon the ability of the bondholders to redeem the outstanding 1 convertible senior notes within less than 12 months the outstanding balance has been classified as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of december 31 2009 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 102 million which included 32 million of accrued interest and penalties we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2010 we are not however able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2009 we had outstanding 56 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases approximately 06 million and 36000 of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities and are classified as shortterm and longterm marketable securities respectively on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through october 2014 the remaining 50 million of irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

the conversion features of our 1 convertible senior notes due december 15 2033 are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features 

  

associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity therefore these instruments meet the scope exception of the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of the guidance see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

litigation 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on litigation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2008 the financial accounting standards board or the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurement for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually we adopted this guidance on january 1 2009 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities we adopted this guidance on january 1 2009 this guidance provides that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method upon adoption a company is required to adjust retrospectively its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions in this guidance the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for business combinations we adopted this guidance on january 1 2009 the standard significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration contingencies acquisition costs inprocess research and development and restructuring costs in addition under the standard changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination that occur after the measurement period will impact income tax expense the standard may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if or when we enter into any business combinations in the future 

in april 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance clarifying how companies should determine fair value measurements when the level of market activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased the authoritative guidance is effective for periods ending after june 15 2009 the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance for recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments the authoritative guidance requires an entity to recognize the credit component of an otherthantemporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the noncredit component in other comprehensive loss when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery the guidance is effective for periods ending after june 15 2009 as of december 31 2009 we did not have any debt securities that had otherthantemporary impairments that contained both a credit and noncredit component accordingly adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification which we refer to as the codification the codification became the single source for all authoritative accounting principles recognized by 

  

the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after september 15 2009 the codification does not change gaap and did not have an effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in september 2009 the fasb’s emerging issues task force issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables this guidance provides another alternative for establishing fair value for a deliverable when vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price for separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method this guidance is effective january 1 2011 and early adoption is permitted we expect to adopt this guidance effective january 1 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial position and results of operations 

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to additional requirements and guidance regarding disclosures of fair value measurements the guidance requires the gross presentation of activity within the level 3 fair value measurement rollforward and details of transfers in and out of level 1 and 2 fair value measurements it also clarifies two existing disclosure requirements on the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques the new requirements and guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the level 3 rollforward which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 including interim periods within those fiscal years we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio in our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments we place our investments with high quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds united states treasury obligations highquality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

at december 31 2009 we held 2749 million in par value of ars that have experienced failed auctions which has prevented us from liquidating those investments due to these liquidity issues we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments such analysis considered the timing of expected future successful auctions the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december 31 2009 assumed a weighted average discount rate of 398 and expected term of five years the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaarated ars market the expected term was based on management’s estimate of future liquidity as a result as of december 31 2009 we have estimated an aggregate loss of 304 million of which 208 million related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity and of which 96 million was related to the impairment of ars deemed otherthantemporary and included in gain loss on investments net in our 2009 and 2008 consolidated statements of operations on a cumulative basis the impact for the year ended december 31 2009 was a pretax gain of 164 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity related to ars having impairments deemed to be temporary as well as a net gain of 33 million included in gain loss on investments net in our consolidated statement of operations related to the impairment of ars deemed otherthantemporary the aggregate gain in the fair value of ars experienced in the year ended december 31 2009 was due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used in the computation of fair values to 398 from 6275 used as of december 31 2008 

our valuation of the ars is sensitive to market conditions and management’s judgment and could change significantly based on the assumptions used if as of december 31 2009 we had used a term of three years or seven years and discount rate of 390 the gross unrealized loss on the 1987 million in par value of ars classified as availableforsale would have been 130 million or 280 million respectively if we had used a term of five years and discount rate of 290 or 490 the gross unrealized loss on the 1987 million in par value of ars classified as availableforsale would have been 123 million or 291 million respectively 

during november 2008 we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors providing for it to repurchase the ars held through such advisor at par value beginning on june 30 2010 if we cannot liquidate such ars before that date the ars covered by this agreement had a par value of 762 million at december 31 2009 we expect to continue to hold these debt instruments until the earlier of the settlement date or the date on which the market for active trading of ars at par value is reestablished at any time during the period up until june 2010 our investment advisor can call the ars at par value we elected to apply the fair value option permitted under the relevant accounting standard to the put option incorporated in this repurchase agreement as of december 31 2009 the 96 million fair value of such put option was grouped with other shortterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 the 125 million fair value of such put option was grouped with other longterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet the fair value of the put option is determined by comparing the fair values of the related ars as described above to their par values and also considers the credit risk associated with our investment advisor during the year ended december 31 2009 the fair value of the put option decreased by 29 million to 96 million with the resultant loss partially offsetting 33 million of the related ars gain included in gain loss on investments net in our consolidated statement of operations this put option will continue to be adjusted on future balance sheet dates based on its then fair value 

  

our 1 convertible senior notes are subject to changes in market value under certain conditions the holders of our 1 convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the notes on or after december 15 2010 as of december 31 2009 the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the 1 convertible senior notes were 1998 million and 3376 million respectively 

we have operations in europe asia australia and india as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates additionally we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations we do not have any foreign currency hedge contracts

meeting the challenges of the internet 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other entities conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the challenges inherent in delivering content over the internet are compounded by the internal technology challenges facing enterprises driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives for example many companies use the internet as a key marketing tool for product launches distribution of promotional videos or contests these onetime events may draw millions of visitors to a company’s website over a brief period of time so the enterprise must have in place the capacity to deal with a flood of visitors seeking to view content or use applications at the same time budget limitations may preclude a company from putting in place extensive internal infrastructure knowing that it will not always need such capacity in addition as reliance on the internet has become more pervasive website operators have been experiencing higher levels of traffic to their sites on a constant basis which place extensive demands on infrastructure 

to address these challenges we have developed solutions designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations we particularly seek to address the following market needs 

superior performance  commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers transact business and provide information about themselves if however a company’s internet site fails to provide visitors with a fast and dependable experience they will likely abandon that site potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the enterprise’s reputation through a combination of people processes and technology we help our customers improve the scalability and predictability of their websites without the need for them to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have a presence in more than 900 networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the “edge” of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations for our customers at the same time our customers have access to control features to enable them to provide content to end users that is current and customized for visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world 

scalability  we believe that scalability is one of the keys to reliability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites and almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points during the day with the proliferation of internet video enterprises of all types must be able to cope with rapidly increasing numbers of requests for bandwidthintensive digital media assets and the storage of those assets in all of these instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions to meet 

  

such peaks and valleys with more than 40000 servers deployed worldwide managed by our proprietary software technology our network is designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned traffic peaks and related storage needs without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an ondemand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure 

security security is one of the most significant challenges facing use of the internet for business and government processes security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can impact every measure of performance including information security speed reliability and customer confidence unlike traditional security strategies that can negatively impact performance akamai’s approach is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance may not be compromised perhaps most significantly our distributed network of thousands of servers is designed to eliminate a single point of failure and can reduce the impact of security attacks 

functionality websites have become increasingly dynamic complex and sophisticated to meet these challenges we have added solutions through both internal investment and acquisitions these new solutions have included services designed to help our customers accelerate dynamic content and applications more effectively manage their online media assets and improve the quality of their online advertising initiatives

our technology and network 

our expansive network infrastructure and sophisticated technology are the foundation of our services we believe akamai has deployed the world’s largest globally distributed computing platform with more than 40000 

  

servers located in more than 900 networks around the world applying our proprietary technology we deliver our customers’ content and computing applications across a system of widely distributed networks of servers the content and applications are then processed at the most efficient places within the network servers are deployed in networks ranging from large backbone network providers to medium and small isps to cable modem and satellite providers to universities and other networks by deploying servers within a wide variety of networks we are better able to manage and control routing and delivery quality to geographically diverse users we also have more than 1000 peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end user networks which reduces data loss while also potentially giving us more options for delivery at reduced cost 

to make this widereaching deployment effective we use specialized technologies such as advanced routing load balancing data collection and monitoring our intelligent routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors experience fast page loading access to applications and content assembly wherever they are on the internet regardless of global or local traffic conditions dedicated professionals staff our network operations control center on a 247 basis to monitor and react to internet traffic patterns and trends we frequently deploy enhancements to our software globally to introduce new service offerings which are designed to improve the effectiveness of our network technology updates are efficiently replicated across our system customers are also able to control the extent of their use of akamai services to scale on demand using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as they require to support widely varying traffic and rapid growth without the need for an expensive and complex internal infrastructure 

business segments and geographic information 

we operate in one industry segment providing services for accelerating and improving delivery of content and applications over the internet for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 25 23 and 22 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations outside the united states of which 18 17 and 18 of overall revenues respectively was derived from europe no single country outside of the united states accounted for 10 or more of our revenues in any of such years for more segment and geographic information including total longlived assets for each of the last two fiscal years see our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including note 19 thereto 

customers 

our customer base is centered on enterprises as of december 31 2008 our customers included many of the world’s leading corporations including adobe apple audi best buy burger king emc hitachi l’oreal microsoft mtv networks myspace the national basketball association nintendo sap and victoria’s secret we also actively sell to government agencies as of december 31 2008 our public sector customers included the federal emergency management agency the national center for missing and exploited children the us air force the us department of defense the us food and drug administration and the us department of labor no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 or 2006 less than 10 of our total revenues in each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10 of our total revenues in 2009 

sales service and marketing 

our sales and service professionals are located in 20 offices in the united states europe and asia we market and sell our services and solutions domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 100 active channel partners including electronic data systems corporation ibm corporation verizon and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketingfocused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers sales agents and referral partners by aligning with these companies we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

  

our sales and service organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 720 employees in our sales and support organization including 142 direct sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit train and retain sufficient global sales technical and services personnel and how well we establish and maintain our reseller and strategic alliances we believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows strategic alliances and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2008 we had 50 employees in our global marketing organization which is a component of our sales and support organization 

research and development 

our research and development personnel are continuously undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing services strengthen our network and create new services in response to our customers’ needs and market demand as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 390 research and development engineers many of whom hold advanced degrees in their fields our research and development expenses were 392 million 441 million and 331 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in addition for each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we capitalized 239 million 178 million and 117 million respectively net of impairments of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used by us to deliver our services and operate our network additionally during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we capitalized 74 million 64 million and 43 million respectively of stockbased compensation attributable to our research and development personnel 

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and 

  

server switches some of our competitors also resell our services other companies have recently emerged that offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the internet in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an externallymanaged services provider like akamai 

with respect to our new ads offerings we compete with a range of other companies that provide targeted advertising solutions at the same time some of the companies that offer competitive solutions have entered into strategic agreements with us that we believe are mutually beneficial we compete on the basis of our technology the availability of our data cooperative our predictive analytics capabilities the ability to leverage existing business relationships and price 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and price 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content and application delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had a total of approximately 1500 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with innovative approaches and established companies with greater resources 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do some of our existing resellers are competitors if one or more other resellers that generate substantial revenues for us were to terminate our relationship or become a competitor or a reseller for a competitor our business could be adversely affected other competitors may attract customers by offering lesssophisticated versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge given the relative ease with which some customers can potentially switch to another content delivery network provider any 

  

differentiated offerings or lower pricing by competitors could lead to a rapid loss of customers our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their offerings with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai as a result our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased it is an important component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and government agencies about our services and convince them to entrust their content and applications to an external service provider and akamai in particular if we are unsuccessful in such efforts our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve 

in recent quarters we have lowered the prices we charge many of our customers for our content delivery services in order to remain competitive this has been particularly true for the digital media services consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes in addition our operating expenses have increased on an absolute basis in each of 2006 2007 and 2008 if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to new or existing content delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

we believe our revenue growth rate will decline in 2009 as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and macroeconomic factors affecting certain aspects of our business we also believe our operating margins will decrease because we have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative and other expenses as a result we may not be able to continue to maintain our current level of profitability in 2009 or on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter we announced a restructuring in november 2008 that included termination of the employment of approximately seven percent of our global workforce which resulted in a charge of approximately 25 million in 2008 there is no guarantee that the restructuring will be sufficient to improve the alignment of our expenses with revenues or that future restructurings will not be required therefore we will need to generate higher revenues to maintain profitability at recent levels or at all 

there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 general global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 

our business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic and market conditions weakness in the united states andor worldwide economy has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows in particular weakness in the online advertising market has affected and could continue to affect the success of our ads initiatives and could have a negative impact on our media and other customers to the extent customers are unable to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver on their behalf such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenues additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure customer loss and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all suppliers on which we rely for servers bandwidth colocation and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions which in turn could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses there can be no assurance therefore that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

our failure to manage growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

we have continued to grow diversify and evolve our business both in the united states and internationally it is unclear however whether such growth will continue in the event of a slowing in our rate of growth we must also address the challenges of establishing an appropriate organizational size while maintaining the quality of our services as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters if we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or to anticipate our future personnel needs our business may be adversely affected 

as our business evolves we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to effectively manage our technical support infrastructure we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems and organization in a timely and costeffective manner to accommodate changing circumstances our business may be adversely affected 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of applications and content over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that 

  

our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard affected customers will be entitled to credits our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and server capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers in addition our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers’ traffic we believe that absent extraordinary circumstances we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer we may not be able to deploy on a timely basis enough servers to meet the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the functioning of those servers in addition damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks that we do not control from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently and costeffectively fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

as part of our business strategy we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and divert management attention 

in late 2006 and early 2007 we acquired nine systems corporation or nine systems netli and red swoosh additionally we completed the acquisition of acerno in november 2008 if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases acquisitions are accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies 

  

or benefits in connection with a future acquisition if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result in addition future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash as in the acerno acquisition or as in the nine systems netli and red swoosh acquisitions dilutive issuances of securities 

our stock price has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events may cause the price of our common stock to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

if we are unable to continue to innovate and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions our ability to provide new and innovative solutions is important to our future growth other companies are also looking to offering internetrelated solutions such as cloud computing to generate growth these other companies may develop technological or business model innovations in the markets we seek to address that are or are perceived to be equivalent or superior to our services in addition our customers’ business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers’ needs for our services our operating results depend on our ability to adapt to market changes and develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources failures in execution or market acceptance of new services we introduce could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and consequently loss by us of market share revenues and earnings 

  

if the accounting estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software investments contingent obligations allowance for doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructuring charges and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct actual results may differ materially from our estimates and we may need to among other things accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results 

a substantial portion of our marketable securities are invested in auction rate securities continued failures in the auctions for these securities may affect our liquidity 

we held 2871 million in par value of auction rate securities or ars as of december 31 2008 which represented approximately 47 of our total short and longterm marketable securities of 6156 million as of that date ars are securities that are structured to allow for shortterm interest rate resets but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years at the end of each reset period which typically occurs every seven to 35 days investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par beginning in february 2008 the majority of ars in the marketplace including the ars that we hold in our portfolio failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders such failures resulted in the interest rate on these ars resetting to predetermined rates in accordance with the underlying loan agreement which might be lower than the current market rate of interest in the event we need to liquidate our investments in these types of securities including for purposes of funding our operations we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments in which demand equals or exceeds the supply of such securities being offered the issuer redeems the outstanding securities a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities mature or there is a default requiring immediate payment from the issuer these alternative liquidation measures may require that we sell our ars at a substantial discount to par value in the future should the ars we hold be subject to prolonged auction failures and we determine that the decline in value of ars is otherthantemporary we would recognize a loss in our consolidated statement of operations which could be material in addition any future failed auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of our investments and our ability to fund our operations furthermore if one or more of the issuers of the ars held in our portfolio are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through additional impairment charges which could be material 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is increasing competition for talented individuals in the regions in which our primary offices are located this 

  

affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we compensate our officers and employees in part through equity incentives including stock options a significant portion of these stock options held by our officers and employees have exercise prices in excess of the current market price of our common stock which has diminished the retentive value of such options the loss of the services of any of our key employees could hinder or delay the implementation of our business model and the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

we may need to defend our intellectual property and processes against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology 

we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid brought against us or pursuant to which we indemnify our customers could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention of our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented such licenses may also be nonexclusive meaning our competition may also be able to access such technology furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

  

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed from mit technology that is covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

we have longterm debt as of december 31 2008 our total longterm debt was 1999 million if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due we would be in default under the terms of our longterm debt obligations which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which in turn would seriously harm our business 

changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 

federal state foreign and international laws and regulations may govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers visitors to their websites and others in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacy related laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

  

a large number of legislative proposals pending before the united states congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concern data privacy and retention issues related to our business particularly the advertisingrelated services we have begun to offer it is not possible to predict whether when or the extent to which such legislation may be adopted in addition the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current data protection policies and practices complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours the adoption of an of these measures could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services local tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes in those jurisdictions which could adversely affect our continued profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to reflect our total actual liability congress has been contemplating net neutrality legislation the adoption of laws regulating the operation of the internet could affect our business as a government contractor we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable requirements then we could face penalties contract terminations and damage to our reputation we also may be required to devote substantial resources to the development and improvement of procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations 

if our ability to deliver media files in popular proprietary content formats were to become restricted or costprohibitive demand for our content delivery services could decline we could lose customers and our financial results could suffer 

our business depends on our ability to deliver media content in all major formats if our legal right or technical ability to store and deliver content in one or more popular proprietary content formats such as adobe ® flash ® or windows ® media ®  was limited our ability to serve our customers in these formats would be impaired and the demand for our content delivery services would decline by customers using these formats owners of propriety content formats may be able to block restrict or impose fees or other costs on our use of such formats which could lead to additional expenses for us and for our customers or which could prevent our delivery of this type of content altogether such interference could result in a loss of existing customers increased costs and impairment of our ability to attract new customers which would harm our revenue operating results and growth 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors 

  

if we are required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

if we seek to acquire significant businesses or technologies or require more cash to fund our future plans we may need to obtain funding from outside sources the current economic environment makes it difficult for companies to obtain financing particularly raising debt financing or implementing credit facilities therefore we may not be able to raise additional capital which could limit future actions we may want to take even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today or issue debt that places restrictions on our future activities we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 

a class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved 

we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended see note 11 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

we may become involved in other litigation that may adversely affect us 

in the ordinary course of business we are or may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition to ordinarycourse litigation we are a party to the litigation described below 

between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of our board of directors authorized management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement that was subject to approval by the court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement the parties agreed to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order and on august 31 2005 the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement on december 5 2006 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit overturned the district court’s certification of the class of plaintiffs who are pursuing the claims that would be settled in the settlement against the underwriter defendants thereafter the district court ordered a stay of all proceedings in all of the lawsuits pending the outcome of plaintiffs’ petition to the second circuit for rehearing en banc and resolution of the class certification issue on april 6 2007 the second circuit denied plaintiffs’ rehearing petition but clarified that the plaintiffs may seek to certify a more limited class in the district court on june 25 2007 the district court signed an order terminating the settlement we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously an adverse resolution of this action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit 

in addition on or about october 3 2007 vanessa simmonds a purported akamai shareholder filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of washington against the underwriters involved in our 1999 initial public offering of common stock alleging violations of section 16b of the exchange act the complaint alleges that the combined number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the lead underwriters and certain unnamed officers directors and principal shareholders exceeded ten percent of our outstanding common stock from the date of our initial public offering on october 29 1999 through at least october 28 2000 the complaint further alleges that those entities and individuals were thus subject to the reporting requirements of section 16a and the shortswing trading prohibition of section 16b and failed to comply with those provisions the complaint seeks to recover from the lead underwriters any “shortswing profits” obtained by them in violation of section 16b akamai was named as a nominal defendant in the action but has no liability for the asserted claims none of our directors or officers serving in such capacities at the time of our initial public offering are currently named as defendants in this action but there can be no guarantee that the complaint will not be amended or a new complaint or suit filed to name such directors or officers as defendants in this action or another action alleging a violation of the same provisions of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended we do not expect the results of this action to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum in recent years however we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly twelvemonth or longer periods our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions that our existing customers purchase at the same time we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than or at the same rate as our revenues accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 

our increase in net income in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2006 reflects the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while limiting the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

 

   

we were profitable for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in november 2008 we announced a workforce reduction affecting 110 employees across all functional areas we recorded 20 million as a restructuring charge for the amount of onetime benefits provided to affected employees included in these costs is a net reduction in noncash stockbased compensation of 08 million reflecting a modification to certain stockbased awards previously granted to affected employees additionally in december 2008 in connection with excess and vacated facilities under longterm noncancelable leases we recorded 05 million as a restructuring charge for the estimated future lease payments less estimated sublease income for these vacated facilities we expect that 17 million of these liabilities will be paid in 2009 

based on our analysis of among other things the aforementioned trends and events as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2009 however our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including generating positive net income in any future period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities capitalized internaluse software costs goodwill and other intangible assets tax reserves impairment 

  

and useful lives of longlived assets loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and the financial accounting standards board or fasb emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly quarterly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an installation fee when the services are first activated the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive income from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue when the event or usage has occurred 

when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element’s relative fair value provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period commencing when all services have begun to be provided for most multielement service arrangements we have entered into to date the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable therefore all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period commencing when we have begun to provide all services ordered 

  

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred installation and activation setup fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash basis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses increases in the reserve for cash basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

  

valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities 

effective january 1 2008 we implemented sfas no 157 “fair value measurement” or sfas no 157 for our financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at least annually sfas no 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and longterm marketable securities that have been classified as level 1 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in sfas no 157 fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices interest rates and yield curves fair values determined by level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 

investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be otherthantemporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is otherthantemporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

included in our short and longterm marketable securities at december 31 2008 and 2007 are ars that are primarily aaarated bonds most of which are collateralized by federally guaranteed student loans ars are longterm variable rate bonds tied to shortterm interest rates that may reset through a “dutch auction” process that is designed to occur every seven to 35 days historically the carrying value par value of ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates beginning in midfebruary 2008 and continuing throughout the period ended december 31 2008 however the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful as a result the interest rates on ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements we will not be able to liquidate affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer or the securities mature due to the longterm nature of the underlying student loan bonds and the failure of the auction process to provide a current market we classified these investments as longterm on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 

in light of these liquidity issues we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december 31 2008 assumes a weighted average discount rate of 6275 and expected term of five years the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaarated ars market the expected term was based on management’s estimate of future liquidity as a result as of december 31 2008 we have estimated an aggregate loss of 501 million of which 372 million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity and of which 129 million was related to the 

  

impairment of ars deemed otherthantemporary and included in gain loss on investments net in the consolidated statement of operations 

despite the failed auctions we continue to receive cash flows in the form of specified interest payments from the issuers of ars in addition except for ars with respect to which we have entered into an agreement allowing us to sell such ars in june 2010 we have the intent and ability to hold our ars until a recovery of the impairment because we believe we have sufficient cash and other marketable securities onhand and from projected cash flows from operations such that we do not anticipate a need to sell our ars prior to a recovery to par value see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december 31 2008 and 2007 we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 these tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

loss contingencies 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

tax reserves 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

  

we currently have significant deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss or nol carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation or fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we adopted the provisions of fin 48 on january 1 2007 as of the date of adoption we had unrecognized tax benefits of 21 million including accrued interest and penalties and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin 48 as of december 31 2008 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 61 million including accrued interest and penalties 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 123r and staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sharebased payment” changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options which could have a material impact on our financial statements in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 

for stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards’ vesting periods for those awards that contain only a service vesting feature for awards with a performance condition vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting periods 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

  

results of operations 

revenues total revenues increased 24 or 1545 million to 7909 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 6364 million for the year ended december 31 2007 total revenues increased 48 or 2077 million to 6364 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 4287 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increases in revenue during the years presented were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers increased sales to existing customers contributed to increases in the average revenue per customer during each year partially offset by reduced unit prices offered to new and renewing customers we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services we expect this trend to continue in 2009 but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and a leveling off of the rate of increased growth in use of the internet also contributing to the increase in revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 were revenues generated through our acquisitions of acerno which added 69 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2008 netli nine systems and red swoosh as of december 31 2008 we had 2858 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 2645 at december 31 2007 and 2347 at december 31 2006 

for 2008 and 2007 25 and 23 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 18 and 17 of total revenues respectively was derived from operations in europe for 2006 22 of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 18 of total revenues was derived from operations in europe other than the united states no single country accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues during these periods we expect international sales to increase slightly as a percentage of our total sales in 2009 as compared to prior years resellers accounted for 16 of revenues in 2008 18 in 2007 and 20 in 2006 for 2008 2007 and 2006 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions 

 

 cost of revenues increased 33 or 552 million to 2226 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1674 million for the year ended december 31 2007 cost of revenues increased 78 or 733 million to 1674 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 941 million for the year ended december 31 2006 these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internaluse software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure additionally in 2008 2007 and 2006 cost of revenues included stockbased compensation expense such expense decreased by 09 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased by 14 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 cost of revenues during 2008 2007 and 2006 also included credits received of approximately 33 million 34 million and 15 million respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any will vary 

  

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers for the years ending december 31 2009 and 2010 the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services are approximately 424 million and 80 million respectively 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2009 we expect to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally for 2009 we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation expense for research and development personnel who design develop test deploy and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we capitalized software development costs of 239 million 178 million and 117 million respectively net of impairments these development costs consisted of external consulting payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we capitalized as internaluse software 74 million 64 million and 43 million respectively of noncash stockbased compensation these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

research and development expenses decreased 11 or 49 million to 392 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 441 million for the year ended december 31 2007 research and development expenses increased 33 or 110 million to 441 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the research and development expense decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to decreases in stockbased compensation expense and travel costs as well as an increase in amount of costs capitalized as internaluse software partially offset by an increase in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount the research and development expense increase in 2007 as compared to the prior year was due to increases in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount as well as additional stockbased compensation expense 

the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2009 because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

  

sales and marketing expenses increased 11 or 168 million to 1644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1476 million for the year ended december 31 2007 sales and marketing expenses increased 23 or 279 million to 1476 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1197 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and marketing personnel attributable to revenue growth and as a result of higher marketingrelated costs particularly for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2009 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services offset by a reduction in payroll and related costs due to a decrease in our sales and marketing personnel and other marketing costs such as advertising 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 general and administrative expenses increased 12 or 149 million to 1360 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1211 million for the year ended december 31 2007 general and administrative expenses increased 34 or 309 million to 1211 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 902 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in general and administrative expenses during both periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth additionally facilitiesrelated costs increased due to office expansions and we incurred increased expenditures for professional services particularly legal and consulting fees this increase was offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense during 2008 in comparison to 2007 

  

the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2009 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring and an increase in rent and facilities costs offset by an expected reduction in litigationrelated expenses 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased 22 or 25 million to 139 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 114 million for the year ended december 31 2007 amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by 29 million or 35 over amortization of other intangible assets in the year ended december 31 2006 of 85 million the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions of acerno in november 2008 and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the red swoosh acquisition in april 2007 the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of netli in march 2007 and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the nine systems acquisition in december 2006 based on our currentlyowned intangible assets we expect amortization of other intangible assets to be approximately 167 million 164 million 164 million 154 million and 126 million for the years ending december 31 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income decreased 4 or 10 million to 248 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 258 million for the year ended december 31 2007 interest income increased 46 or 81 million to 258 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 177 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in the interest rates offsetting higher cash and marketable securities balances driven by an increase in our cash from operations the increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our total invested marketable securities as a result of an increase in our cash from operations 

interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense decreased 8 or 03 million to 28 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 interest expense decreased 3 or 85000 to 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 32 million for the year 

  

ended december 31 2006 interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our 1 convertible senior notes based upon our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2008 we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations including deferred financing amortization will not exceed 31 million in 2009 

other income expense net other income expense net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains on legal settlements other income net decreased 13 or 66000 to other income net of 05 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to other income net of 05 million for the year ended december 31 2007 other income net was 06 million for the year ended december 31 2006 other income net for the year ended december 31 2008 consisted of 05 million of foreign exchange gains and 4000 of net gains on legal settlements other income net of 05 million for the year ended december 31 2007 consisted of approximately 35000 of foreign exchange gains and 05 million of net gains on legal settlements for the year ended december 31 2006 other income net of 06 million consisted of approximately 90000 of foreign exchange losses offset by 05 million of net gains on legal settlements other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 

gain loss on investments net during the year ended december 31 2008 we recorded a net loss on investments of 02 million which reflects a loss of 129 million due to otherthantemporary impairments on marketable securities a gain of 125 million realized on a put option received from one of our investment advisors in november 2008 and a gain of 02 million on the sale of marketable securities during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we recorded a net gain on investments of 24000 and 03 million respectively from the sale of marketable securities we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in 2009 

loss on early extinguishment of debt during 2007 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of 3000 as a result of conversions to common stock of 01 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible notes in august 2007 and 40000 in principal amount of such notes in january 2007 we did not record any loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the 2006 or 2008 

provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2008 our effective tax rate of 381 was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits for the years ended december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 our effective tax rates of 400 and 415 respectively were higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 

provision for income taxes increased by 33 or 222 million to 894 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 672 million during the year ended december 31 2007 provision for income taxes increased by 64 or 262 million to 672 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 411 million during the year ended december 31 2006 these increases were primarily due to increases in our operating income 

while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2009 to remain relatively consistent with 2008 this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with sfas no 123r or any potential tax planning strategies our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options further our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

  

because of the availability of nols a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a noncash expense consequently the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2008 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate debt securities us treasury and government agency securities commercial paper corporate debt securities and student loanbacked ars totaled 7716 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

we held approximately 2871 million and 2800 million in par value of ars at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the ars are primarily aaarated bonds most of which are guaranteed by the us government as part of the federal family education loan program through the us department of education none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgagebacked or collateralized debt obligations in midfebruary 2008 all of our ars experienced failed auctions which failures continued throughout the rest of 2008 as a result we have been unable to liquidate most of our holdings of ars based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial 

  

condition or results of operations in 2009 in november 2008 we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors that provides for the repurchase in june 2010 of 765 million of the ars we hold if we have been unable to achieve liquidity with respect to such securities before that time 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1065 million to 3435 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2370 million for the year ended december 31 2007 cash provided by operating activities increased 1042 million to 2370 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 1327 million for the year ended december 31 2006 we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates 

net cash used in investing activities was 3644 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2267 million for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash used in investing activities was 2056 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cash used in investing activities for 2008 reflects the purchase of acerno in november 2008 for 837 million net purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 5331 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1154 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 3677 million net cash used in investing activities for 2007 reflects net purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 5506 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1005 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 4158 million and 79 million of net cash acquired through our acquisitions of netli in march 2007 and red swoosh in april 2007 additionally net cash used in investing activities during 2007 included a decrease of 07 million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits net cash used in investing activities for 2006 reflects net purchases of short and longterm investments of 3959 million and purchases of property and equipment of 693 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs in addition approximately 51 million of cash including transaction costs was used to acquire nine systems in december 2006 these purchases and investments were offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short and longterm securities of 2643 million and a decrease of 04 million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits for 2009 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately 15 of total revenue for the year we expect to fund such capital expenditures through cash generated from operations 

cash provided by financing activities was 331 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 525 million for the year ended december 31 2007 cash provided by financing activities was 604 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 included proceeds of 220 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2008 also included 112 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options cash provided by financing activities was 525 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 604 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 included proceeds of 316 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 also included 209 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 included proceeds of 279 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 also included 325 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 

  

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 

 as part of an agreement entered into with one of our investment advisors under which it agreed to repurchase 765 million of our ars in june 2010 we were also offered the ability to enter into a line of credit that would be collateralized by the underlying ars investments in january 2009 the line of credit for 765 million was approved by the investment advisor we have not yet used the line of credit 

we believe based on our present business plan that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities we may not however be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of additional factors that could affect our liquidity 

  

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2008 for the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 

 in accordance with fin no 48 as of december 31 2008 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 61 million which included approximately 13 million of accrued interest and penalties we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2009 we are not however able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2008 we had outstanding 86 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases approximately 36 million of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities of which 34 million are classified as shortterm marketable securities and 02 million are classified as longterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through may 2011 the remaining 50 million of irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

the conversion features of our 1 convertible senior notes due december 15 2033 are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity therefore these instruments meet the scope exception of paragraph 11a of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and are 

  

accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas no 133 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

litigation 

we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on litigation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

we adopted sfas no 157 on january 1 2008 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements during 2008 the fasb issued the following amendments to sfas no 157 

 

  

  

 in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” or sfas no 141r sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r became effective for us on january 1 2009 the impact of the standard on our financial position and results of operations will be dependent upon the number of and magnitude of the acquisitions that are consummated once the standard is effective 

in december 2007 the fasb released sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” this statement will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity this new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders this statement is effective for us on january 1 2009 as of december 31 2008 we did not have any minority interests 

in april 2008 the fasb issued an fasb staff position on sfas no 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” or fsp fas no 1423 fsp fas no 1423 amends the factors that should be 

  

considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” or sfas no 142 fsp fas no 1423 is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 141r and other generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america fsp fas no 1423 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we do not expect fsp fas no 1423 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position or fsp eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” this fsp provides that unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method upon adoption we are required to retrospectively adjust our earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions in this fsp this fsp became effective for us on january 1 2009 we have not yet determined the impact if any of this fsp on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio in our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments we place our investments with high quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds united states treasury obligations highquality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

at december 31 2008 we held 2871 million in par value of ars that have experienced failed auctions which has prevented us from liquidating those investments as a result we have classified these investments as longterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 due to these liquidity issues we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december 31 2008 assumes a weighted average discount rate of 6275 and expected term of five years the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaarated ars market the expected term was based on management’s estimate of future liquidity as a result as of december 31 2008 we have estimated an aggregate loss of 501 million of which 372 million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders’ equity and of which 129 million was related to the impairment of ars deemed otherthantemporary and included in gain loss on investments net in the consolidated statement of operations based on our ability to access our cash and shortterm investments and our expected cash flows we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these ars will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations during 2009 or our ability to operate our business in 2009 

our valuation of the ars is sensitive to market conditions and management’s judgment and could change significantly based on the assumptions used if we had used a term of three years or seven years and discount rate of 6275 the gross unrealized loss on the 2106 million in par value of ars classified as availableforsale would have been 237 million or 491 million respectively if we had used a term of five years and discount rate of 5275 or 7275 the gross unrealized loss on the 2106 million in par value of ars classified as availableforsale would have been 288 million or 451 million respectively 

during november 2008 we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors providing for it to repurchase the ars held through such advisor at par value beginning on june 30 2010 the ars covered by this agreement had a par value of 765 million at december 31 2008 we expect to continue to hold these longterm debt instruments until the earlier of the settlement date or the date on which the market for active trading of ars at par value is reestablished at any time during the period up until the june 2010 our investment advisor can call the ars at par value we elected to apply the fair value option under sfas no 159 to the put option incorporated in this repurchase agreement the 125 million fair value of such put option is grouped with other longterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet with the resultant gain offsetting 129 million of the related ars impairment included in other income net the fair value of the put option is determined by comparing the fair value of the related ars as described above to their par values and also considers the credit risk associated with our investment advisor this put option will be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 

the valuation of our 765 million in par value of ars subject to the put option is also sensitive to market conditions and management’s judgment and could change significantly based on assumptions used resulting in a change in the realized loss on investments recorded in our consolidated statement of operations any change in the realized loss on the ars would however be offset by a corresponding change in the realized gain on the valuation of the put option related to these ars recorded in our consolidated statement of operations any net gain loss from future changes in market conditions is not expected to be material because the changes in valuations of the ars and related put option will generally offset each other 

  

our 1 convertible senior notes are subject to changes in market value under certain conditions the holders of our 1 convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the notes on or after december 15 2010 as of december 31 2008 the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the 1 convertible senior notes were 1999 million and 2210 million respectively 

we have operations in europe asia australia and india as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates additionally we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations we do not have any foreign currency hedge contracts

meeting the challenges of the internet 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other entities conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many challenges including 

 

  

  

  

  

 the challenges inherent in the internet are compounded by the internal technology challenges facing enterprises driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives for example many companies use the internet as a key marketing tool for product launches distribution of promotional videos or contests these onetime events may draw millions of visitors to a company’s website over a brief period of time so the enterprise must have in place the capacity to deal with a flood of visitors seeking to view content or use applications in addition as reliance on the internet has become more pervasive website operators have been experiencing higher levels of traffic to their sites on a constant basis which place extensive demands on infrastructure at the same time budget limitations may preclude a company from putting in place extensive internal infrastructure knowing that it will handle less traffic during the rest of the year 

to address these challenges we have developed solutions designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations we particularly seek to address the following market needs 

superior performance commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers transact business and provide information about themselves if however a company’s internet site fails to provide visitors with a fast and dependable experience they will likely abandon that site potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the enterprise’s reputation through a combination of people processes and technology we help our customers improve the scalability and predictability of their websites without the need for them to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have a presence in more than 900 networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the “edge” of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations at the same time our customers have access to control features to enable them to provide content to end users that is current and customized for visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world 

scalability we believe that scalability is one of the keys to reliability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites and almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points during the day with the proliferation of internet video enterprises of all types must be able to cope with rapidly increasing numbers of requests for bandwidthintensive digital media assets and the storage of those assets in all of these instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions to meet such peaks and valleys with more than 30000 servers deployed worldwide managed by our proprietary software technology our network is designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned traffic 

  

peaks and related storage needs without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an ondemand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure 

security security is one of the most significant challenges facing use of the internet for business and government processes security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can impact every measure of performance including information security speed reliability and customer confidence unlike traditional security strategies that can negatively impact performance akamai’s approach is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance is not compromised perhaps most significantly our distributed network of thousands of servers is designed to eliminate a single point of failure and can reduce the impact of security attacks 

our core solutions 

we offer services and solutions for digital media and software distribution and storage content and application delivery application performance services and other specialized internetbased offerings

our technology and network 

our expansive network infrastructure and sophisticated technology are the foundation of our services we believe akamai has deployed the world’s largest globally distributed computing platform with more than 30000 servers located in more than 900 networks around the world applying our proprietary technology we deliver our customers’ content and computing applications across a system of widely distributed networks of servers the content and applications are then processed at the most efficient places within the network servers are deployed in networks ranging from large backbone network providers to medium and small isps to cable modem and satellite providers to universities and other networks by deploying servers within a wide variety of networks we are better able to manage and control routing and delivery quality to geographically diverse users we also have more than 1000 peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end user networks which reduces data loss while also potentially giving us more options for delivery at reduced cost

we operate in one business segment providing services for accelerating delivery of content and applications over the internet for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 23 22 and 21 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations outside the united states of which 17 18 and 16 of overall revenues respectively was derived from europe no single country outside of the united states accounted for 10 or more of our revenues in any of such years for more segment and geographic information including revenue from customers a measure of profit or loss and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years see our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k including note 19 thereto 

customers 

our customer base is centered on enterprises as of december 31 2007 our customers included many of the world’s leading corporations including apple audi bestbuy fedex corporation hitachi l’oreal microsoft mtv networks the national basketball association nintendo qantas airways sap and victoria’s secret we also actively sell to government agencies as of december 31 2007 our public sector customers included the federal emergency management agency the internal revenue service the national center for missing and exploited children the us air force the us department of defense the us food and drug administration and the us department of labor no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 or 2005 less than 10 of our total revenues in each of the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10 of our total revenues in 2008 

sales service and marketing 

our sales and service professionals are located in 20 offices in the united states europe and asia we market and sell our services and solutions domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 50 active resellers including electronic data systems corporation ibm corporation verizon and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketingfocused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers sales agents and referral partners by aligning with these companies we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

our sales and service organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 590 employees in our sales and support organization including 139 direct sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit train and retain sufficient global sales technical and services personnel and how well we establish and maintain our strategic alliances we believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements participation at trade shows strategic alliances and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2007 we had 73 employees in our global marketing organization which is a component of our sales and support organization 

research and development 

our research and development personnel are continuously undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing services strengthen our network and create new services in response to our customers’ needs and market 

  

demand as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 350 research and development engineers many of whom hold advanced degrees in their fields our research and development expenses were 441 million 331 million and 181 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in addition for each of the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we capitalized 178 million 117 million and 85 million respectively net of impairments of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we capitalized 64 million and 43 million respectively of stockbased compensation 

competition 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of our competitors also resell our services other companies have recently emerged that offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative to our services in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an externally managed services provider like akamai 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of the quality of our offerings our customer service and price 

proprietary rights and licensing 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content and application delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology two of these patent applications have now been issued these patents will expire in 2018 we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had a total of approximately 1300 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with innovative approaches and established companies with greater resources 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do some of our existing resellers are potential competitors if one or more resellers that generate substantial revenues for us were to terminate our relationship and become a competitor or a reseller for a competitor our business could be adversely affected other competitors may attract customers by offering lesssophisticated versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their offerings with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai as a result our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased it is an important component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and government agencies about our services and convince them to entrust their content and applications to an external service provider and akamai in particular if we are unsuccessful in such efforts our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years we expect that this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve 

in recent quarters we have lowered the prices we charge our customers for our content delivery services in order to remain competitive consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes in addition our operating expenses have increased on an absolute basis in each of 2005 2006 and 2007 if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to our existing content delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

  

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

we may not be able to maintain our current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative and other expenses therefore we will need to generate higher revenues to maintain profitability at recent levels or at all there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to manage growth diversification and changes to our business could harm us 

we are continuing to grow diversify and evolve our business both in the united states and internationally as a result of the diversification of our business personnel growth acquisitions and international expansion in the recent years many of our employees are now based outside of our cambridge massachusetts headquarters if we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or to anticipate our future growth and personnel needs our business may be adversely affected 

as we grow and diversify our business we must also expand and adapt our operational infrastructure our business relies on our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial reporting and control systems all of these systems have become increasingly complex in the recent past due to the growing diversification and complexity of our business acquisitions of new businesses with different systems and increased regulation over controls and procedures to effectively manage our technical support infrastructure we will need to continue to upgrade and improve our data systems billing systems and other operational and financial systems procedures and controls these upgrades and improvements will require a dedication of resources and in some cases are likely to be complex if we are unable to adapt our systems in a timely manner to accommodate our growth our business may be adversely affected 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of application and content delivery services over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard our customer does not pay for all or a part of its service on that day our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions there can be no assurance that attacks by 

  

unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our enhanced security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

we may have insufficient transmission and server capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers in addition our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers’ traffic we believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer we may not be able to deploy on a timely basis enough servers to meet the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the functioning of those servers in addition damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

as part of our business strategy we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 

we acquired three companies in late 2006 and early 2007 nine systems corporation or nine systems netli and red swoosh if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result in addition future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or as in the nine systems netli and red swoosh acquisitions dilutive issuances of securities 

our stock price has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our shares regardless of our operating performance 

if we are unable to continue to innovate and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions other companies may develop technological or business model innovations that address content delivery and application acceleration requirements in ways that are or are perceived to be equivalent or superior to our services in addition our customers’ business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers’ needs for our services our operating results depend on our ability to adapt to market changes and develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources failures in execution or market acceptance of new services we introduce could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and consequently loss of market share revenues and earnings 

if the estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software contingent obligations doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructuring charges and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct we may need to accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

a substantial portion of our shortterm marketable securities is invested in highlyrated auction rate securities failures in these auctions may affect our liquidity 

a substantial percentage of our marketable securities portfolio is invested in highlyrated municipal auction rate securities auction rate securities are securities that are structured to allow for shortterm interest rate resets but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years at the end of each reset period which typically occurs every 28 days investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par during february 2008 

  

the majority of auction rate securities in the marketplace including certain auction rate securities that we held in our portfolio failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders such failures resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting to predetermined rates in accordance with the underlying loan agreement which might be higher or lower than the current market rate of interest in the event we need to liquidate our investments in these types of securities we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful the issuer redeems the outstanding securities a buyer is found outside the auction process the securities mature or there is a default requiring immediate repayment from the issuer in the future should the auction rate securities we hold be subject to additional auction failures andor we determine that the decline in value of auction rate securities are other than temporary we would recognize a loss in our consolidated statement of operations which could be material in addition any future failed auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of our investments furthermore if one or more issuers of the auction rate securities held in our portfolio are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge which could be material 

future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships there is increasing competition for talented individuals in the areas in which our primary offices are located this affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

we have licensed technology from mit covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may need to defend our intellectual property and processes against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights against both technology providers and customers that use such technology we have agreed to indemnify our customers if our services infringe specified intellectual property rights therefore we could become involved in litigation brought against customers if our services and technology are implicated any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

   

  

 if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention of our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

we have operations in several foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

we have longterm debt as of december 31 2007 our total longterm debt was 1999 million if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due we would be in default under the terms of our longterm debt obligations which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which in turn would seriously harm our business 

  

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours this could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes that would adversely affect our continued profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to reflect our total actual liability congress has been contemplating net neutrality legislation the impact of the adoption of laws regulating the operation of the internet could impact our business as a government contractor we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable requirements then we could face penalties contract terminations and damage to our reputation we also may be required to devote substantial resources to the development and improvement of procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations 

economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 

our business could be affected by general economic conditions weakness in the united states or worldwide economy could have a negative effect on our operating results including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows additionally in a downcycle economic environment we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover there can be no assurance that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors 

if we are required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

if our revenues decrease or grow more slowly than we anticipate if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues or if we seek to acquire significant businesses or technologies we may need to obtain funding from outside sources if we are unable to obtain this funding our business would be materially and adversely affected in addition even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us in addition we may not be able to raise any additional capital 

a class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved 

we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of 

  

common stock in violation of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the exchange act see item 3 of part i of this annual report on form 10k for more information any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

we may become involved in other litigation that may adversely affect us 

in the ordinary course of business we are or may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition to ordinarycourse litigation we are a party to the litigation described below 

between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 and the exchange act primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of our board of directors authorized management to negotiate a 

  

settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement that was subject to approval by the court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement the parties agreed to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order and on august 31 2005 the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement on december 5 2006 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit overturned the district court’s certification of the class of plaintiffs who are pursuing the claims that would be settled in the settlement against the underwriter defendants thereafter the district court ordered a stay of all proceedings in all of the lawsuits pending the outcome of plaintiffs’ petition to the second circuit for rehearing en banc and resolution of the class certification issue on april 6 2007 the second circuit denied plaintiffs’ rehearing petition but clarified that the plaintiffs may seek to certify a more limited class in the district court on june 25 2007 the district court signed an order terminating the settlement we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously an adverse resolution of this action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit 

in addition on or about october 3 2007 vanessa simmonds a purported akamai shareholder filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of washington against the underwriters involved in our 1999 initial public offering of common stock alleging violations of section 16b of the exchange act the complaint alleges that the combined number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the lead underwriters and certain unnamed officers directors and principal shareholders exceeded ten percent of our outstanding common stock from the date of our initial public offering on october 29 1999 through at least october 28 2000 the complaint further alleges that those entities and individuals were thus subject to the reporting requirements of section 16a and the shortswing trading prohibition of section 16b and failed to comply with those provisions the complaint seeks to recover from the lead underwriters any “shortswing profits” obtained by them in violation of section 16b akamai was named as a nominal defendant in the action but has no liability for the asserted claims we do not expect the results of this action to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum in recent years however we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly twelvemonth or longer periods our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions that our existing customers purchase at the same time we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than or at the same rate as our revenues accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 

our improved financial results in 2007 as compared to 2006 and 2005 reflect the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while limiting the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

 

   

we were profitable for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

based on our analysis of among other things the aforementioned trends and events as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2008 however our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our ability to 

 

  

  

  

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including generating positive net income in any future period 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

overview 

our mda is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves capitalized internaluse software costs intangible assets and goodwill income and other taxes impairment and useful lives of longlived assets loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

definitions 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and the financial accounting standards board or fasb emerging issues task force issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract 

  

has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual or other nonmonthly period revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s actual usage each month and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 

we typically charge customers an installation fee when the services are first activated the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive income from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the fee is fixed or determinable the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 

when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element’s relative fair value provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period for most multielement service arrangements to date the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable therefore all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period provided that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

in limited instances resulting in less than 1 of total revenue in each year reported we also license software under perpetual and term license agreements we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modifications of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” as prescribed by this guidance we apply the residual method of accounting the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements as indicated by vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value be deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements so long as all other revenue recognition criteria of sop 972 are met 

we recognize revenue from fixedfee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin or arb no 45 “longterm constructiontype contracts” and with the applicable guidance provided by sop 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype 

  

contracts” we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project in certain customer arrangements we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change at the outset of a fixedfee arrangement if we are not able to estimate the total cost to complete nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones we account for the arrangement using the completedcontract method of accounting under this method we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixedfee contract indicates a loss we will record the loss immediately 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred installation and activation setup fees and amounts billed under extended payment terms 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash basis increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses increases in the reserve for cash basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities 

the fair value of our investments and marketable securities is generally determined from quoted market prices based upon transactions in active markets we also have investments in auction rate securities that consist entirely of municipal debt securities recorded at cost which approximates fair market value unless the auction fails due to their variable interest rates which reset through an auction process typically every 28 days this auction mechanism generally allows existing investors to continue to own their securities with a revised interest 

  

rate based on the auction or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value because of these short intervals between interest reset dates we monitor these auctions to ensure they are successful which provides evidence that the recorded values of these investments approximate their fair values to the extent an auction were to fail such that the securities were deemed to be not liquid we would need to seek other alternatives to determine the fair value of these securities which may not be based on quoted market transactions 

investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including among other factors the duration of the period that and extent to which the fair value is less than cost basis the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors and overall market conditions and trends once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary a writedown is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty writedowns if recorded could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if among other things relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 these tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

loss contingencies 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

tax reserves 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

we currently have significant deferred tax assets comprised of net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized during 2005 our management determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized and accordingly released substantially all of our valuation allowance this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a twelvequarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income at that time 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas 123r3 “transition election to accounting for the tax effect of sharebased payment awards” we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stockbased compensation pursuant to sfas no 123r under the modified prospective transition method no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stockbased payments that continue to be classified as equity awards additionally we elected to use the “longform method” as provided in paragraph 81 of sfas no 123r to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits upon adoption of sfas no 123r the longform method required us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 123 subject to adjustments for net operating loss or nol carryforwards 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation or fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we adopted the provisions of fin 48 on january 1 2007 as of the date of adoption we had unrecognized tax benefits of 21 million including accrued interest and penalties and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin 48 as of december 31 2007 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 40 million including accrued interest and penalties 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

since january 1 2006 we have accounted for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r prior to that date we recognized stockbased compensation costs pursuant to accounting principles bulletin no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 123 “sharebased payment” in the notes to our financial 

  

statements see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 123r and staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sharebased payment” changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options which could have a material impact on our financial statements in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 

for stock options restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the awards’ vesting periods for those awards that contain only a service vesting feature for awards with a performance condition vesting feature we recognize compensation cost on a gradedvesting basis over the awards’ expected vesting periods 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

results of operations 

revenues total revenues increased 48 or 2077 million to 6364 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 4287 million for the year ended december 31 2006 total revenues increased 51 or 1456 million to 4287 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2831 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increases in revenue during the years presented were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers the latter leading to increases in the average revenue per customer during each year partially offset by reduced unit prices offered to new and renewing customers we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers particularly in the media and entertainment segment is the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services we expect this trend to continue in 2008 also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 were revenues generated through our acquisitions of netli and nine systems as of december 31 2007 we had 2645 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 2347 at december 31 2006 and 1910 at december 31 2005 

for 2007 and 2006 23 and 22 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 17 and 18 of total revenues respectively was derived from operations in europe for 2005 21 of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 16 of total revenues was derived from operations in europe other than the united states no single country accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues during these periods we expect international sales to increase slightly as a percentage of our overall sales in 2008 as compared to prior years resellers accounted for 18 of revenues in 2007 20 in 2006 and 24 in 2005 for 2007 2006 and 2005 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues 

  

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions 

 

 cost of revenues increased 78 or 733 million to 1674 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 941 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cost of revenues increased 69 or 384 million to 941 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2005 these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continued to invest in our infrastructure additionally in 2007 and 2006 cost of revenues included stockbased compensation expense which increased by 14 million and 20 million respectively as compared to 2006 and 2005 respectively cost of revenues during 2007 2006 and 2005 also included credits received of approximately 34 million 15 million and 12 million respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any will vary 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers for the years ending december 31 2008 2009 and 2010 the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services are approximately 382 million 66 million and 24 million respectively 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2008 we expect to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally for 2008 we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand additionally cost of revenues is expected to increase as a result of higher stockbased compensation expense due to additional equity awards we expect to grant to networkrelated personnel 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation for research and development personnel who design develop test and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for certain internaluse software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we capitalized software development costs of 178 million 117 million and 85 million respectively net of impairments these development costs consisted of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we 

  

capitalized 64 million and 43 million respectively of noncash stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

research and development expenses increased 33 or 110 million to 441 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 research and development expenses increased 83 or 150 million to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared 181 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the research and development expense increases in both 2007 and 2006 as compared to the prior years were due to increases in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount as well as additional stockbased compensation expense 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2008 as we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make investments in our core technology develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased 23 or 279 million to 1476 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1197 million for the year ended december 31 2006 sales and marketing expenses increased 54 or 418 million to 1197 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 779 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and marketing personnel attributable to revenue growth and as a result of higher stockbased compensation expense particularly for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 

the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

   

we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in 2008 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services the expected increase in hiring of sales and marketing personnel and additional expected increases in other marketing costs such as advertising 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 general and administrative expenses increased 34 or 309 million to 1211 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 902 million for the year ended december 31 2006 general and administrative expenses increased 70 or 372 million to 902 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 530 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in general and administrative expenses during both periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth as well as higher stockbased compensation expense additionally facilitiesrelated costs have increased due to office expansions and we have incurred increased expenditures for professional services particularly legal fees related to current litigation matters 

the following table quantifies the net increase in various components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2008 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring an increase in rent and facilities costs and higher litigationrelated expenses in connection with a trial that commenced in february 2008 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased 35 or 29 million to 114 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

as compared to 85 million for the year ended december 31 2006 amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 34 million or 66 over amortization of other intangible assets in the year ended december 31 2005 of 51 million the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions of netli in march 2007 and nine systems in december 2006 the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of speedera in june 2005 based on our currently owned intangible assets we expect amortization of other intangible assets to be approximately 134 million 136 million 129 million 123 million and 115 million for the years ending december 31 2008 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income increased 46 or 81 million to 258 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 177 million for the year ended december 31 2006 interest income increased 315 or 134 million to 177 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in our total invested marketable securities as a result of an increase in our cash from operations the increase in interest income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was also due to an increase in our invested marketable securities in 2006 as compared to 2005 an increase in cash from operations as well as the investment of the 2021 million in net proceeds we received from our public equity offering of 120 million shares of our common stock in november 2005 

interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense decreased 3 or 85000 to 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2006 interest expense decreased 41 or 22 million to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 53 million for the year ended december 31 2005 based upon our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2007 we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations including deferred financing amortization will not exceed 31 million in 2008 

other income expense net other income expense net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains and losses on legal settlements other income net decreased 8 or 43000 to other income net of 527000 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to other income net of 570000 for the year ended december 31 2006 other expense net was 507000 for the year ended december 31 2005 other income net for the year ended december 31 2007 consisted of 35000 of foreign exchange gains and 492000 of net gains on legal settlements other income net of 570000 for the year ended december 31 2006 consisted of approximately 90000 of foreign exchange gains and 480000 of net gains on legal settlements for the year ended december 31 2005 other expense net of 507000 consisted of approximately 15 million of foreign exchange losses offset by 10 million of net gains on legal settlements other income expense net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 

gain loss on investments net during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded a net gain on investments of 24000 on the sale of marketable securities during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we recorded a net gain on investments of 261000 and a net loss on investments of 27000 respectively from the sale of marketable securities we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in 2008 

loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 was 14 million as a result of our redemption of 566 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes during 2005 this loss of 14 million consisted of 889000 in premiums above par value paid to redeem such notes and 481000 of deferred financing costs associated with redeeming such notes prior to their maturity 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes for the year ended december 31 2007 our effective tax rate of 400 was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation and an increase in our tax valuation allowance for capital loss carryforwards partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits for the year ended december 31 2006 our effective tax rate of 415 was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of nondeductible stockbased compensation partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits for the year ended december 31 2005 our effective tax rate was a benefit of 3635 and was higher than the 35 statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a tax benefit of 2858 million recorded in connection with the release of substantially all of the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 

provision for income taxes increased by 64 or 262 million to 672 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 411 million during the year ended december 31 2006 benefit from income taxes was 2576 million for the year ended december 31 2005 during 2005 in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recorded an income tax benefit of 2858 million which was offset by provisions for income taxes primarily related to our alternative minimum tax obligations and income earned in profitable foreign jurisdictions as a result of the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2005 we recorded a provision for income taxes of 411 million and 672 million in 2006 and 2007 respectively 

based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a twelvequarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations during the third quarter of 2005 we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our united states and foreign nol carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration as a result during 2005 we released a total of 3495 million of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance of such amount 2858 million was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations 610 million was attributable to stock option exercises which was recorded as an increase in additional paidin capital on our balance sheet and approximately 27 million was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets 

as of december 31 2007 we had a total valuation allowance of 112 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a valuation allowance of 67 million against capital loss carryforwards that are expected to expire unused and also reversed an existing valuation allowance of 19 million related to certain state nol carryforwards 

while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2008 to remain relatively consistent with 2007 this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with sfas no 123r or any potential tax planning strategies our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options further our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events including settlements of tax audits and assessments the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

because of the availability of the nols discussed above a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a noncash expense consequently the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

  

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

liquidity and capital resources 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2007 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities which consisted of corporate debt securities us treasury and government agency securities commercial paper municipal debt securities and municipal auction rate securities totaled 6335 million we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 

we held approximately 2800 million in municipal auction rate securities at december 31 2007 these investments consisted solely of municipal debt securities none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgagebacked in midfebruary 2008 many of our municipal auction rate securities experienced failed auctions of the 2800 million of auction rate securities we held at december 31 2007 approximately 1455 million had experienced failed auctions through february 26 2008 the continued uncertainty in the credit markets which has caused our auction rate securities to fail prevented us from liquidating certain of our holdings of auction rate securities based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1034 million to 2354 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 1320 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cash provided by operating activities increased 492 million to 1320 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 828 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues partially 

  

offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries in connection with expected increases in headcount and higher commissions the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2267 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 2056 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cash provided by investing activities was 1838 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash used in investing activities for 2007 reflects net purchases of short and longterm availableforsale securities of 5506 million and purchases of property and equipment of 1005 million including the capitalization of internaluse software development costs related to our current and future service offerings amounts attributable to these purchases and investments were offset in part by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short and longterm marketable securities of 4158 million and 79 million of net cash acquired in our acquisitions of netli in march 2007 and red swoosh in april 2007 additionally cash used in investing activities during 2007 included a decrease of 07 million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits cash used in investing activities for 2006 reflects net purchases of short and longterm investments of 3959 million and purchases of property and equipment of 693 million in addition approximately 51 million of cash including transaction costs was used to acquire nine systems in december 2006 these purchases and investments were offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of short and longterm securities of 2643 million and a decrease of 04 million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 reflects purchases of property and equipment of 362 million and net purchases of short and longterm marketable securities of 2156 million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in november 2005 these investments were offset by sales and maturities of short and longterm securities of 661 million acquisition of 17 million in cash through the acquisition of speedera and a decrease of 02 million in restricted investments previously held for security deposits for 2008 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately 16 of total revenues 

cash provided by financing activities was 525 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 604 million for the year ended december 31 2006 cash provided by financing activities was 1591 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 included proceeds of 316 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 also included 209 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 included proceeds of 279 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 also included 325 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options cash provided by financing activities in 2005 reflects net proceeds from our november 2005 equity offering of 2021 million and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 145 million offset by payments made to redeem 566 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes and payments on capital lease obligations of 08 million 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in among other things working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

  

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 

 we believe based on our present business plan that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities we may not however be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of additional factors that could affect our liquidity 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2007 over the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 

   

in accordance with fin no 48 as of december 31 2007 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 40 million which included approximately 08 million of accrued interest and penalties we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in 2008 we are not however able to provide a reasonable reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 

letters of credit 

as of december 31 2007 we had outstanding 86 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to facility leases approximately 36 million of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities of which 31 million are classified as longterm marketable securities and 05 million are classified as shortterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through may 2011 the remaining 50 million irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december 2019 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third party licensees of our technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

the conversion features of our 1 convertible senior notes due december 15 2033 are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity therefore these instruments meet the scope exception of paragraph 11a of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas no 133 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

litigation 

we are party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on litigation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” or sfas no 157 which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal

meeting the challenges of the internet 

 

the internet plays a crucial role in the way companies government agencies and other entities conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many challenges including 

 

  

in addition to the challenges inherent in the internet companies and other entities face internal technology challenges driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives for example many companies use the internet as a key marketing tool for product launches distribution of promotional videos or contests these onetime events may draw millions of visitors to a company’s website over a brief period of time so the enterprise must have in place the capacity to deal with a flood of visitors seeking to view content or use applications at the same time budget limitations may preclude a company from putting in place extensive internal infrastructure knowing that it will handle less traffic during the rest of the year 

 

to address these challenges we have developed solutions that are designed to help companies government agencies and other enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations we particularly seek to address the following market needs 

 

superior performance commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers transact business and provide information about themselves if however a company’s internet site fails to provide visitors with a fast and dependable experience they will likely abandon that site potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the enterprise’s reputation our solutions are designed to reduce or eliminate downtime and poor performance of a customer’s website digital media and applications through a combination of people processes and technology we help our customers improve the reliability scalability and predictability of their sites without the need for our customers to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have a presence in nearly 1000 networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the “edge” of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations at the same time our customers have access to control features to enable them to provide content to end users that is current and customized for visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world 

 

scalability we believe that scalability is one of the keys to reliability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites and almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points during the day with the proliferation of internet video enterprises of all types must be able to cope with rapidly increasing numbers of requests for bandwidthintensive digital media assets and the storage of them in all of these instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions to meet such peaks and valleys leveraging more than 20000 servers deployed worldwide our network is designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned traffic peaks and related storage needs without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an on demand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure 

 

security security may be the most significant challenge facing use of the internet for business and government processes because security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can 

impact every measure of performance including information security speed reliability and customer confidence unlike traditional security strategies that can negatively impact performance akamai’s edgeplatform is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance is not compromised perhaps most significantly our distributed network of thousands of servers is designed to eliminate a single point of failure and can reduce the impact of security attacks

sales service and marketing 

 

our sales and service professionals are located in 11 offices in the united states with additional locations in europe and asia we market and sell our services and solutions domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 50 active resellers including electronic data systems corporation ibm corporation verizon and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with resellers we have several other types of sales and marketingfocused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers sales agents and referral partners by aligning with these companies we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

 

our sales and service organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 500 employees in 

our sales and support organization including 103 direct sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit train and retain sufficient sales technical and global services personnel and how well we establish and maintain our strategic alliances we believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel

competition 

 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

  

we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of our competitors also resell our services other companies have recently emerged that offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertisingbased billing or revenuesharing models that may represent an alternative to our services in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external managed services provider like akamai 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry as well as alternative approaches to content and application delivery over the internet on the basis of price the quality of our offerings and our customer service 

 

proprietary rights and licensing 

 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology two of these patent applications have now been issued these patents will expire in 2018 we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had a total of 1058 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with innovative approaches and established companies with greater resources 

 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do some of our existing resellers are potential competitors if one or more resellers that generate substantial revenues for us were to terminate our relationship and become a competitor or a reseller for a competitor our business could be adversely affected other competitors may attract customers by offering lesssophisticated versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their offerings with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai as a result our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internet related solutions that are not servicebased it is an important component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and government agencies about our services and convince them to entrust their content and applications to an external service provider and akamai in particular if we are unsuccessful in such efforts our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

 

if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs our business and financial results are likely to suffer 

 

prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years we expect that this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes in addition our operating expenses have increased on an absolute basis in each of 2004 2005 and 2006 if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to our existing content delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

 

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

 

the year ended december 31 2004 was the first fiscal year during which we achieved profitability as measured in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative and other expenses therefore we will need to generate higher revenues to maintain profitability at recent levels or at all there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 

  

as part of our business strategy we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 

 

on december 13 2006 we completed our acquisition of nine systems corporation or nine systems and in june 2005 we completed our acquisition of speedera networks inc or speedera on february 5 2007 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire netli inc or netli if attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or purchases acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a productive result in addition future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or as in the nine systems and speedera acquisitions dilutive issuances of securities 

 

future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 

 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results for example beginning in 2006 under statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “share based payment” or sfas no 123r we are required to account for our stockbased awards as a compensation expense and as a result our net income and net income per share in subsequent periods has been significantly reduced previously we recorded stockbased compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value at the time they were granted 

 

for option grants that have an exercise price at fair market value we calculated compensation expense and disclosed its impact on net income loss and net income loss per share as well as the impact of all stockbased compensation expense in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements sfas no 123r required us to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our first quarter of 2006 and requires us to expense stockbased awards including shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan stock options restricted stock deferred stock units and restricted stock units as compensation cost as a result our earnings per share is likely to be significantly lower in the future even if our revenues increase 

 

if we are unable to develop new services and enhancements to existing services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources failures in execution or market acceptance of new services we introduce could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and consequently loss of market share revenues and earnings 

 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of application and content delivery services over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard our customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that day our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters unauthorized access to our servers failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our enhanced security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are 

unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

 

we may have insufficient transmission and server capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers in addition our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers’ traffic we believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer we may not be able to deploy on a timely basis enough servers to meet the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the functioning of those servers in addition damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

 

if the estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition stockbased compensation costs capitalization of internaluse software contingent obligations doubtful accounts intangible assets and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructuring charges and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct we may need to accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that they rely on in implementing our business plan there is increasing competition for talented individuals in the areas in which our primary offices are located this affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

 

we have licensed technology from mit covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we may need to defend our intellectual property and processes against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or maintain profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have previously brought lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights such lawsuits can be expensive and require a significant amount of attention of our management and technical personnel and the outcomes are unpredictable these legal protections afford only limited protection monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

 

we have operations in several foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

 12 

 

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

 

we have longterm debt as of december 31 2006 our total longterm debt was 2000 million if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due we would be in default under the terms of our longterm debt obligations which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which in turn would seriously harm our business 

 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours this could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes that would adversely affect our continued profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to reflect our total actual liability internetrelated laws remain largely unsettled even in areas where there has been some legislative action the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or our operations or interpretations of existing law could adversely affect our business 

 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors 

 

our stock price has been volatile 

 

the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following 

 

 13 

 

any of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our shares regardless of our operating performance 

 

if we are required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

 

if our revenues decrease or grow more slowly than we anticipate if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues or if we seek to acquire significant businesses or technologies we may need to obtain funding from outside sources if we are unable to obtain this funding our business would be materially and adversely affected in addition even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us in addition we may not be able to raise any additional capital 

 

a class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved 

 

we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended see item 3 of part i of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2006 for more information any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

 

we may become involved in other litigation that may adversely affect us 

 

in the ordinary course of business we are or may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of akamai’s board of directors authorized management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement that is subject to approval by the court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement the parties agreed to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order and on august 31 2005 and the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement on december 5 2006 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit overturned the district court’s certification of the class of plaintiffs who are pursuing the claims that would be settled in the settlement against the underwriter defendants plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the second circuit on january 5 2007 in response to the second circuit’s decision and have informed the district court that they would like to be heard as to whether the settlement may still be approved even if the decision of the court of appeals is not reversed the district court indicated that it would defer consideration of final approval of the settlement pending plaintiffs’ request for further appellate review we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and if the settlement is not finalized and approved we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously an adverse resolution of the action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit if the settlement is not finalized and approved

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum in recent years however we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on twelvemonth or longer periods our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions our existing customers purchase at the same time we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than or at the same rate as our revenues accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers acquisitions or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 

 

  recent events 

 

on december 13 2006 we acquired all of the outstanding equity of nine systems in exchange for approximately 27 million shares of akamai common stock and approximately 45 million in cash and we assumed options that had been issued by nine systems corporation that are exercisable for approximately 400000 shares of akamai common stock the revenues and expenses generated from the acquisition date december 13 2006 to december 31 2006 were not significant to our fiscal 2006 financial results reported in our consolidated statement of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

on february 5 2007 we announced that we had entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire netli under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger upon consummation we will acquire all of the outstanding equity of netli in exchange for approximately 32 million shares of akamai’s common stock subject to certain closing adjustments 

 

our improved financial results in 2006 as compared to 2005 and 2004 reflect the success of our efforts to increase our monthly and annual recurring revenues while limiting the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

 

 

 

we were profitable for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future 

 

 20 

  

  

based on our analysis of these identified trends and events we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during 2007 however our future results and our ability to generate profits will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including our ability to 

 

  

given these uncertainties there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including positive net income 

 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

overview 

 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable and related reserves capitalized internaluse software costs intangible assets and goodwill income and other taxes impairment and useful lives of longlived assets restructuring liabilities loss contingencies and stockbased compensation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

definitions 

 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are 

highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 

 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize service revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and the financial accounting standards board or fasb emerging issues task force issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

 

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our payment history with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

 

we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or annual minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage for annual revenue commitments we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer’s usage in such period we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive income from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the fee is fixed or determinable the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 

 

when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element’s relative fair value provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period for most multielement service arrangements to date the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable therefore all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 

 

we also license software under perpetual and term license agreements we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modifications of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” as prescribed by this guidance we apply the residual method of accounting the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop 972 are met 

 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

 

we recognize revenue from fixedfee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin or arb no 45 “longterm constructiontype contracts” and with the applicable guidance provided by sop 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project in certain customer arrangements we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change at the outset of a fixedfee arrangement if we are not able to estimate the total costtocomplete nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones we account for the arrangement using the completedcontract method of accounting under this method we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixedfee contract indicates a loss we will record the loss immediately 

 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be objectively established 

 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

 

deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees prepayments made by customers for future periods deferred installation and activation setup fees amounts billed under extended payment terms and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements 

 

accounts receivable and related reserves 

 

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts cash basis customers and service credits increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received the reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business as well as for billing disputes these credits result in a reduction to revenues decreases to the reserve for service credits are the result of actual credits being issued to customers causing a corresponding reduction in accounts receivable 

 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we reserve for all invoices that have been outstanding greater than one year we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments in addition we reserve a portion of revenues as a 

reserve for service credits reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits these credits typically relate to management’s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments we do not have any offbalance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such events occur we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if this comparison indicates that an impairment is present the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset if a readily determinable market price does not exist fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of january 1 2006 and january 1 2007 these tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill other intangible assets consist of completed technologies customer relationships trademarks and noncompete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value derived from the related intangible assets goodwill is carried at its historical cost 

 

restructuring liabilities related to facility leases 

 

when we vacate a facility subject to a noncancelable longterm lease we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us in the latter case we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income to date we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we record restructuring liabilities discounted at the appropriate rate for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 900000 in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities which we expect will be paid within 12 months 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

tax reserves 

 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred 

income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 

 

we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized during 2005 our management determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be realized and accordingly released substantially all of our valuation allowance this decision was based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a 12quarter period and on the projections of expected future taxable income the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of 391 which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect apportioned by jurisdiction in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 

 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we estimated 

 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 123r3 “transition election to accounting for the tax effect of sharebased payment awards” we have elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stockbased compensation pursuant to sfas no 123r under the modified prospective transition method no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stockbased payments that continue to be classified as equity awards additionally we elected to use the “longform method” as provided in paragraph 81 of sfas no 123r to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits the longform method requires us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 123 subject to adjustments for net operating loss carryforwards 

 

accounting for stockbased compensation 

 

since january 1 2006 we have accounted for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r historically we recognized stockbased compensation costs pursuant to accounting principles bulletin no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 123 “sharebased payment” in the notes to our financial statements see note 16 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 123r and staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sharebased payment” changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options which could have a material impact on our financial statements in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates our stockbased compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 

 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus 

qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

 

results of operations 

 

revenues total revenues increased 51 or 1456 million to 4287 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2831 million for the year ended december 31 2005 total revenues increased 35 or 731 million to 2831 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2100 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in total revenues for 2006 as compared to 2005 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of 1460 million service revenue which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services increased 52 to 4275 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2815 million for the year ended december 31 2005 service revenue was 2068 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increases in service revenue during the periods presented were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and increases in the average revenue per customer the increases in service revenue 2006 and 2005 are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers our delivery of streaming services for a number of highprofile media events during 2006 also contributed to higher service revenue also contributing to the increases in service revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 were revenues generated from customers of speedera which we acquired in june 2005 as of december 31 2006 we had 2347 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1910 as of december 31 2005 and 1310 as of december 31 2004 

 

software and softwarerelated revenue decreased 27 or 449000 to 12 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 16 million for the year ended december 31 2005 software and softwarerelated revenue was 33 million for the year ended december 31 2004 software and softwarerelated revenue includes sales of customized software projects and technology licensing the decreases in software and softwarerelated revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects that we undertook for customers and a decrease in the number of software licenses executed with customers we do not expect software and softwarerelated revenue to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2007 

 

for 2006 and 2005 22 and 21 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 18 and 16 of total revenues respectively was derived from operations in europe for 2004 19 of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 14 of total revenues was derived from operations in europe no single country accounted for 10 or more of revenues derived outside of the united states during these periods we do not expect international sales to increase as a percentage of our overall sales in 2007 resellers accounted for 20 of revenues in 2006 24 in 2005 and 27 in 2004 for 2006 and 2005 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues for 2004 microsoft corporation accounted for 10 of total revenues 

 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services amortization of internaluse software and amortization of capitalized stockbased compensation 

 

cost of revenues increased 69 or 384 million to 941 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cost of revenues increased 21 or 95 million to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 462 million for the year ended december 31 2004 these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure additionally cost of revenues increased in 2006 due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

cost of revenues during 2006 2005 and 2004 also included credits received of approximately 15 million 12 million and 10 million respectively from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with 

billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any will vary 

 

cost of revenues is comprised of the following in millions 

 

 

 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers for the years ending december 31 2007 2008 and 2009 the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services are approximately 200 million 84 million and 897000 respectively 

 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2007 we expect to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs along with increased payroll and related costs as we continue to make investments in our network to service our customer base cost of revenues is also expected to increase as we continue to expense employee stock awards at fair value in accordance with sfas no 123r the adoption of sfas no 123r will also result in additional expense associated with the amortization of stockbased compensation 

 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stockbased compensation for research and development personnel who design develop test and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except certain internal use software development costs eligible for capitalization during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we capitalized software development costs of 117 million 85 million and 75 million respectively net of impairments these development costs consisted of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs for personnel involved in the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network additionally for the year ended december 31 2006 we capitalized 43 million of stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

 

research and development expenses increased 83 or 150 million to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 181 million for the year ended december 31 2005 research and development expenses increased 49 or 59 million to 181 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 were 121 million research and development expense increased in 2006 due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense resulting from sfas no 123r the increase in 2005 was due to an increase in payroll and related costs due to an increase in headcount 

 

the following table quantifies the net changes in research and development expenses over periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2007 as we continue to increase our hiring of development personnel and make investments in our core technology and refinements to our other service offerings additionally research and development expenses are expected to increase as a result of expensing stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r 

 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs stockbased compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and service support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 54 or 418 million to 1197 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 779 million for the year ended december 31 2005 sales and marketing expenses increased 40 or 222 million to 779 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was partially the result of higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and marketing personnel due to revenue growth additionally marketing and related expense increased in 2006 due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense as a result of sfas no 123r 

 

the following table quantifies the net changes in sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in 2007 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services the expected increase in hiring of sales and marketing personnel and additional expected increases in other marketing costs such as advertising additionally sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase as a result of expensing stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 

 28 

 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 70 or 372 million to 902 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 530 million for the year ended december 31 2005 general and administrative expenses increased 13 or 60 million to 530 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2006 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth as well as stockbased compensation expense the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth as well as stockbased compensation expense these increases were offset by a reduction in legal and consulting costs associated with the dismissal of the lawsuits between akamai and speedera as a result of our acquisition of speedera and a reduction in nonincome taxes as a result of settlements with state taxation authorities in 2005 that allowed us to reduce the related accrual these onetime savings resulted in higher nonincome taxes in 2006 as compared to the prior year 

 

the following table quantifies the net changes in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we capitalized software development costs of 889000 and 718000 respectively consisting of external consulting fees and payroll and payrollrelated costs associated with the development of internallyused software applications once the projects are completed such costs will be amortized and included in general and administrative expenses 

 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2007 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring an increase in nonincome tax expense and an increase in rent and facilities costs because we expanded leased office space during 2006 additionally general and administrative expenses are expected to increase as a result of higher stockbased compensation expense as a result of sfas no 123r 

 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased to 85 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 51 million for the year ended december 31 2005 amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2004 was 48000 the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2006 was due to the amortization of intangible assets of 34 million in connection with the acquisition of nine systems in december 2006 and speedera in june 2005 the increase in amortization of intangible assets in 2005 as compared to 2004 was due to the amortization of intangible assets of 51 million in connection with our acquisition of speedera we expect to amortize approximately 107 million 102 million 92 million 76 million and 64 million for fiscal years 

2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 respectively as a result of the nine systems and speedera acquisitions in january 2007 we announced a plan to acquire netli inc if this acquisition is completed we expect that amortization of other intangible assets will increase in the future 

 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income increased 315 or 134 million to 177 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2005 interest income increased 98 or 21 million to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in interest income in 2006 as compared to 2005 and 2004 was due to an increase in our invested marketable securities period over period due to the investment of 2021 million in net proceeds we received from our public equity offering of 120 million shares of our common stock in november 2005 as well as generating greater cash flows from operations we also experienced an increase in interest rates earned on our investments 

 

interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense decreased 41 or 22 million to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 53 million for the year ended december 31 2005 interest expense decreased 48 or 49 million to 53 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease during each of these periods was due to lower interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes during 2005 and 2004 we redeemed or repurchased 566 million and 1694 million respectively in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes as of december 31 2006 there was an aggregate principal amount of 200 million of our 10 convertible senior notes outstanding we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations including deferred financing amortization will not exceed 31 million in 2007 

 

other income expense net other income expense net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains and losses on legal settlements other net expense decreased 212 or 11 million to other net income of 570000 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to other net expense of 507000 for the year ended december 31 2005 other net income was 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 other net income for the year ended december 31 2006 represented 90000 of foreign exchange gains and 480000 of net gains on legal settlements other net expense of 507000 for the year ended december 31 2005 represented approximately 15 million of foreign exchange losses offset by 10 million of net gains on legal settlements for the year ended december 31 2004 other net income of 11 million represented approximately 518000 of gains on legal settlements and 543000 of foreign exchange gains other net income expense may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 

 

gain loss on investments net during the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded a net gain on investments of 261000 on the sale of marketable securities during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we recorded a net loss on investments of 27000 and 69000 respectively from the sale of marketable securities we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in 2007 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt we had no loss on early extinguishment of debt during 2006 because we did not redeem or repurchase any debt during the year loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to 14 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2005 is due to costs incurred in connection with our redemption of 566 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes during 2005 this loss of 14 million consists of 889000 in premiums above par value paid to redeem such notes and 481000 of deferred financing costs associated with redeeming such notes prior to their maturity during 2004 we repurchased 1694 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 68 million 

 

provision benefit for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to 411 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to a benefit for income taxes of 2576 million during the year ended december 31 2005 provision for income taxes was 772000 for the year ended december 31 2004 during 2005 in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recorded an income tax benefit of 2858 million which was offset by provision for income taxes primarily related to our alternative minimum tax 

obligations and income earned in profitable foreign jurisdictions as a result of the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2005 we recorded a provision for income taxes of 411 million in 2006 the provision for income taxes for 2004 was primarily related to our alternative minimum tax payment obligations and income earned in foreign jurisdictions where we were profitable 

 

as of december 31 2004 our united states and foreign net operating losses or nols and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because at the time pursuant to sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” we did not have sufficient history of taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a 12quarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations during the third quarter of 2005 we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our united states and foreign nol carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other deferred tax assets as a result during 2005 we released a total of 3495 million of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance of the 3495 million 2858 million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations 610 million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises which was recorded as an increase in additional paidin capital on our balance sheet and approximately 27 million of the valuation release was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had a remaining valuation allowance of 63 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded additional deferred tax assets related to acquired nol carryforwards from nine systems however these nols are subject to limitation pursuant to section 382 of the internal revenue code due to changes in ownership of more than 50 because the realization of these deferred tax assets does not meet the “more likely than not” criterion under sfas no 109 we recorded a valuation allowance of 44 million against the acquired nols we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of 19 million related to certain state nols that we expect will expire unused 

 

while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2007 to remain relatively consistent with 2006 this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with sfas no 123r the effective tax rate including the effect of discrete items could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options 

 

because of the availability of the nols discussed above a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a noncash expense consequently the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances and projections of our future provision for income taxes annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions 

 

 31 

 

  

as of december 31 2006 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 4345 million of which 42 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash cash equivalents and marketable securities see “letters of credit” below 

 

cash provided by operating activities increased 492 million to 1320 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 828 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash provided by operating activities increased 316 million to 828 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 512 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for each of 2006 and 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to increased service revenue as well as increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries in connection with expected increases in headcount the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 

 

cash used in investing activities was 2056 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 1838 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash provided by investing activities was 91 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash used in investing activities for 2006 reflects net purchases of short and longterm investments of 1316 million and capital expenditures of 693 million consisting of the capitalization of internaluse development costs related to our current and future service offerings and purchases of network infrastructure equipment in addition approximately 51 million of cash including transaction costs was used to acquire nine systems these investments were offset by a decrease of 400000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 reflects net purchases of marketable securities of 1495 million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in november 2005 additionally cash used in investing activities for 2005 includes capital expenditures of 362 million these investments were offset by 17 million of cash acquired through the speedera acquisition and a decrease of 202000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects proceeds from net sales and maturities of investments of 241 million offset by capital expenditures of 201 million during 2004 cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of 50 million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of 50 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of 96000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits for 2007 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately the same percentage of revenues as 2006 

 

cash provided by financing activities was 604 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 1591 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash used in financing activities was 1319 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 included proceeds of 279 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 also includes 325 million related to excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options cash provided by financing activities in 2005 reflects net proceeds from our november 2005 equity offering of 2021 million and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 

145 million offset by payments made to redeem 566 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on capital lease obligations of 818000 cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects payments for the repurchase of approximately 1694 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of 543000 offset by net proceeds received from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes of 243 million and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 138 million 

 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

 

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

we believe based on our current business plan that our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 4345 million as of december 31 2006 and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of potential dilution 

 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2006 over the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 

 

 

letters of credit 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had outstanding 42 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to longterm facility leases the letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities of which 31 million are classified as longterm marketable securities and 11 million are classified as shortterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet dated as of december 31 2006 the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through may 2011 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors stockholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

 

the conversion features of our 1 convertible senior notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity therefore these instruments meet the scope exception of paragraph 11a of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas no 133 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

litigation 

 

we are party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on litigation 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” or fin no 48 fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin no 48 prescribes a twostep process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized first the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination if the tax position is deemed morelikelythannot to be sustained the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement fin no 48 will be effective for us beginning in 2007 we do not expect the implementation of fin no 48 to have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission or the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 108 or sab 108 sab 108 expresses the sec staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements sab 108 also states that correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended such correction may be made the next time the registrant files the prior year financial statements registrants electing not to restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the guidance in sab 108 in their annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 the cumulative effect of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year and the offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year registrants should disclose the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment the disclosure should also include when and how each error arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial the sec staff encourages early application of the guidance in sab 108 for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 the implementation of sab 108 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” or sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but may change current practice for some entities sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those years we do not expect the implementation of sab 157 to have a material impact on our financial statements

meeting the challenges of the internet 

 

the internet has matured into a key tool for companies public sector agencies and other entities to conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s business communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many challenges including 

 

  

in addition to the challenges inherent in the internet companies and other entities face internal technology challenges driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives for example as public sector agencies migrate more and more of their processes from inperson mail or phone services to internetbased applications it has become essential that their websites be more reliable and that they deliver their content and applications more efficiently to their constituents at the same time budget limitations may preclude public sector agencies from developing their own infrastructure for internetfacing applications enterprises of all types are confronted with the increasingly widespread use of broadband connectivity leading to more users requesting more varied types of rich content as a result there is greater stress on centralized infrastructures 

 

to address these challenges akamai has developed solutions that are designed to help companies and government agencies increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internetfacing operations 

 

superior performance commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers transact business and provide information about themselves if however a company’s internet site fails to provide visitors with a fast and dependable experience they will likely abandon that site potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the enterprise’s reputation akamai’s edgeplatform is designed to reduce or eliminate downtime and poor performance of a customer’s website and applications through a combination of people processes and technology akamai 

offers solutions designed to achieve reliability stability and predictability without the need for our customers to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have a presence in hundreds of networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the “edge” of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations at the same time our customers have access to control features to enable them to provide content to end users that is current and customized for visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world 

 

scalability we believe that scalability is one of the keys to reliability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites more generally almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points during the day in both instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions against such peaks and valleys linking thousands of servers in hundreds of networks around the world the akamai edgeplatform is designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned traffic peaks without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an on demand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure 

 

security security may be the most significant challenge facing use of the internet for business and government processes because security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can impact every measure of performance including information security speed reliability and customer confidence unlike traditional security strategies that can impact performance negatively akamai’s edgeplatform is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance is not compromised perhaps most significantly our distributed network of thousands of servers is designed to eliminate a single point of failure and can reduce the impact of attacks 

 

our solutions 

 

with the edgeplatform as our backbone we offer services and solutions for content and application delivery application performance services on demand managed services and business performance management services 

 

the akamai edgeplatform 

 

akamai’s edgeplatform is the foundation of our business solutions we believe akamai has deployed the world’s largest globally distributed computing platform with thousands of servers located in hundreds of networks around the world leveraging this platform we deliver our customers’ content and computing applications across a system of widely distributed networks of servers the content and applications are then processed at the most efficient places within the network servers are deployed in networks ranging from large backbone network providers to medium and small isps to cable modem and satellite providers to universities and other networks we also have more than 500 peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end user networks reducing data loss while also giving us more options for delivery during network congestion or failures

akamai media delivery 

 

we believe that the demand for internet access to media of all types—music movies games streaming news and quotes and more—is growing rapidly however there are many challenges to successfully monetizing media assets online in particular media companies need costeffective means to deliver large files to millions of users in different formats compatible with multiple enduser devices and platforms the akamai media delivery service is designed to provide a solution to many of the challenges of media delivery over the internet by helping media industry clients bypass traditional server and bandwidth limitations to better handle peak traffic conditions and large file sizes we support all major streaming formats and the edgeplatform provides capacity levels that individual enterprises cannot costeffectively replicate on their own 

 

akamai electronic software delivery 

 

internet traffic conditions and high loads can dramatically impact software download speed and reliability furthermore surges in traffic from product launches or distribution of security updates can overwhelm traditional software delivery infrastructure impacting web site performance and causing users to be unable to download software our electronic software delivery service is designed to leverage the akamai edgeplatform to provide capacity for large surges in traffic related to software launches and other distributions with a goal of improved customer experiences increased use of electronic delivery and successful product launches 

 

application performance services

our sales and service professionals are located in 9 offices in the united states with additional locations in europe and asia we market and sell our services and solutions domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 40 active resellers including electronic data systems corporation ibm internap network services corporation mci and telefonica group in addition to entering into agreements with reseller partners we have several other types of sales and marketingfocused alliances with entities such as system integrators application service providers sales agents and referral partners by aligning with these companies we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry 

 

our sales and service organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 286 employees in our sales and support organization including 89 direct sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit train and retain sufficient sales technical and global services personnel and how well we establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners we believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel 

 

to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements trade shows strategic partnerships and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2005 we had 57 employees in our global marketing organization 

 

research and development 

 

our research and development personnel are continuously undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing services strengthen our network and create new services in response to our customers’ needs and market demand as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 204 research and development engineers many of whom hold advanced degrees in their field our research and development expenses were 181 million 121 million and 130 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively in addition for each of the years 

ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we capitalized 85 million 75 million and 75 million respectively net of impairments of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network 

 

competition 

 

the market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

 

  

we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of these companies resell our services in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external managed services provider like akamai 

 

proprietary rights and licensing 

 

our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states and foreigncountry patents covering our content delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology two of these patent applications have now been issued these patents will expire in 2018 we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had a total of 784 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with innovative approaches and established companies with greater resources 

 

we compete in markets that are intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do other competitors may attract customers by offering lesssophisticated versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those we charge our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their offerings with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai as a result our competitors include hardware manufacturers software companies and other entities that offer internetrelated solutions that are not servicebased competitors it is an important component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and government agencies about our services and convince them to entrust their content and applications to an external service provider and akamai in particular if we are unsuccessful in such efforts our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer 

 

if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs our business and financial results are likely to suffer 

 

prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years we expect that this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to our existing content delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

 

failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at recent levels or at all 

 

the year ended december 31 2004 was the first fiscal year during which we achieved profitability as measured in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative and other expenses therefore we will need to generate higher revenues to maintain profitability at recent levels or at all there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including

future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 

 

a change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results for example beginning in 2006 under statement of financial accounting standards no 123r or sfas no 123r we will be required to account for our stockbased awards as a compensation expense and our net income and net income per share will be significantly reduced previously we have recorded compensation expense only in connection with option grants that have an exercise price below fair market value for option grants that have an exercise price at fair market value we calculated compensation expense and disclosed their impact on net income loss and net income loss per share as well as the impact of all stockbased compensation expense in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements sfas no 123r requires us to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our first quarter of 2006 and will require us to expense stockbased awards including shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan stock options restricted stock and stock appreciation rights as compensation cost as a result our earnings per share is likely to be significantly lower even if our revenues increase 

 

if we are unable to develop new services and enhancements to existing services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results may suffer 

 

the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technologies is complex and uncertain we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion misunderstandings about market demand or a lack of appropriate resources failures in execution or market acceptance of new services we introduce could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and consequently loss of market share revenues and earnings 

 

any unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business financial results and reputation 

 

our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of application and content delivery services over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard our customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that day our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users although we have taken steps to prevent such disruptions there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future that our enhanced security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be damaging any widespread interruption of the functioning our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

 

as part of our business strategy we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 

 

in june 2005 we completed our acquisition of speedera we may seek to enter into additional business combinations or acquisitions in the future acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential 

unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses any inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operation if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a productive result in addition with future acquisitions we could use substantial portions of our available cash or as in the speedera acquisition make dilutive issuances of securities future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could also have an adverse effect on our ability to remain profitable 

 

because our services are complex and are deployed in complex environments they may have errors or defects that could seriously harm our business 

 

our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

 

we may have insufficient transmission and server capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and loss of revenues 

 

our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers in addition our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to handle all of our customers’ traffic we believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons including due to payment disputes or network providers going out of business any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer we may not be able to deploy on a timely basis enough servers to meet the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the functioning of those servers in addition damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

 

if the estimates we make and the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may be adversely affected 

 

our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition capitalization of internaluse software contingent obligations doubtful accounts and restructuring charges these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructuring charges and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct we may need to accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

 

if we are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

 

our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that they rely on in 

implementing our business plan there is increasing competition for talented individuals in the areas in which our primary offices are located this affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

 

if our license agreement with mit terminates our business could be adversely affected 

 

we have licensed technology from mit covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we may need to defend our intellectual property and processes against patent or copyright infringement claims which would cause us to incur substantial costs 

 

other companies or individuals including our competitors may hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services or develop new services which could make it more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve profitability companies holding internetrelated patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

 

our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties 

 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have brought numerous lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

 

we face risks associated with international operations that could harm our business 

 

we have operations in several foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly 

subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

  

any failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our business 

 

we have longterm debt as of december 31 2005 our total longterm debt was 2000 million if we are unable to remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the future our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due we would be in default under the terms of our notes which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which in turn would seriously harm our business 

 

if we are required to seek additional funding such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

 

if our revenues decrease or grow more slowly than we anticipate if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues or if we seek to acquire significant businesses or technologies we may need to obtain funding from outside sources if we are unable to obtain this funding our business would be materially and adversely affected in addition even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us in addition we may not be able to raise any additional capital 

 

internetrelated and other laws could adversely affect our business 

 

laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing internetrelated services such as ours this could negatively affect both our business directly as well as the businesses of our customers which could reduce their demand for our services tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes that would adversely affect our continued profitability we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our reserves however may not be adequate to reflect our total actual liability internetrelated laws remain largely unsettled even in areas where there has been some legislative action the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or our operations or interpretations of existing law could adversely affect our business 

provisions of our charter documents our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may have antitakeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 

 

provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors 

 

a class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved 

 

we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the exchange act any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

 

we may become involved in other litigation that may adversely affect us 

 

in the ordinary course of business we may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition to ordinarycourse litigation we are a party to the lawsuit described below 

 

between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 and the exchange act primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in 

connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of akamai’s board of directors authorized management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement that is subject to approval by the court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement the parties agreed to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order and on august 31 2005 the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and if the settlement is not finalized and approved we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously an adverse resolution of the action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions our customers purchase at the same time we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than or at the same rate as our revenues accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 

 

our improved financial results in 2005 as compared to 2004 and 2003 reflect our efforts to increase our monthly recurring revenues while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenues consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

 

 

 

we were profitable for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 however we cannot guarantee continued profitability for any period in the future we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future

based on our analysis of these known trends and events we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly basis during 2006 however our future results will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including our ability to 

 

  

as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives including positive net income 

 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

overview 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 

accepted in the united states of america these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable reserves capitalized internaluse software costs intangible assets and goodwill income and other taxes useful lives of property and equipment restructuring accruals and contingent obligations we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

definitions 

 

we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 

 

review of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize service revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” and the financial accounting standards board’s or fasb emerging issues task force issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

 

at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on a combination of factors including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review our payment history with the customer and other forms of payment assurance upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

 

we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum for these services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive income from services sold as discrete nonrecurring events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the fee is fixed or determinable the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 

 

we periodically enter into multielement service arrangements when we enter into such arrangements each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements for example objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the element when sold separately if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period for most multielement service arrangements to date the fair value 

of each element has not been objectively determinable therefore all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period 

 

we also license software under perpetual and term license agreements we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modifications of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” as prescribed by this guidance we apply the residual method of accounting the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop 972 are met 

 

we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 

 

we recognize revenue from fixedfee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin or arb no 45 “longterm constructiontype contracts” and with the applicable guidance provided by sop 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project in certain customer arrangements we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change at the outset of a fixedfee arrangement if we are not able to estimate the total costtocomplete nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones we account for the arrangement using the completedcontract method of accounting under this method we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixedfee contract indicates a loss we will record the loss immediately 

 

from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless both the fair values of our services delivered to the customer and of the vendor’s product or service we receive can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable 

 

we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties we record revenue for these transactions when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service if these conditions are present we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 

 

deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees deferred installation and activation setup fees amounts billed under extended payment terms and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements

trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts cash basis customers and service credits increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers where collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received the 

reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business as well as for billing disputes these credits result in a reduction to revenues decreases to the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to customers causing a corresponding reduction in accounts receivable 

 

estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve until we receive consistent payments in addition we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for service credits reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits these credits typically relate to management’s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments we do not have any offbalance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

 

impairment and useful lives of longlived assets 

 

we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such a triggering event occurs we compare the carrying amount of the longlived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

 

restructuring liabilities related to facility leases 

 

when we vacate a facility subject to a noncancelable longterm lease we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us in the latter case we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income to date we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we record restructuring liabilities discounted at the appropriate rate for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had 23 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities in 2003 we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of 96 million we expect that approximately 14 million of the amount accrued as of december 31 2005 will be paid within 12 months 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the 

likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

tax reserves 

 

our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 

 

we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in the third quarter of 2005 management determined it was more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets would be realized this decision was based on our cumulative history of book earnings over a 12quarter period and on projections of expected future taxable income the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of 3965 which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 

 

we have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our determination of the amount of these tax reserves involves assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the cost of the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated 

 

accounting for stock options 

 

historically through december 31 2005 we recognized stock option costs pursuant to accounting principles board opinion or apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations we have disclosed the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements effective in 2006 we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” both sfas no 123 and 123r require management to make assumptions to determine the fair value of stock options including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the underlying common stock changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of the stock options which could have a material impact on our financial statements additionally in our pro forma disclosure we incorporate a forfeiture estimate as we recognize equity expense should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalized internaluse software costs 

 

we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

 

results of operations 

 

revenues total revenues increased 35 or 731 million to 2831 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2100 million for the year ended december 31 2004 total revenues increased 30 or 488 million to 2100 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 1613 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in total revenues for 2005 as compared to 2004 was attributable to an 

increase in service revenue of 747 million partially offset by a reduction in software and softwarerelated revenue of 16 million the increase in total revenues for 2004 as compared to 2003 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of 494 million partially offset by a reduction in software and softwarerelated revenue of 477000 and related party revenue of 137000 

 

service revenue which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services increased 36 or 747 million to 2815 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 2068 million for the year ended december 31 2004 service revenue was 1574 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and increases in the average revenue per customer these increases are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers also contributing to the increases in service revenue were revenues generated from the acquisition of speedera on june 10 2005 as of december 31 2005 we had 1910 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1310 as of december 31 2004 and 1126 as of december 31 2003 

 

for 2005 and 2004 21 and 19 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 16 and 14 of overall revenues respectively was derived from operations in europe for 2003 16 of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 13 of overall revenues was derived from operations in europe no single country accounted for 10 or more of revenues derived outside of the united states during these periods resellers accounted for 24 of revenues in 2005 27 in 2004 and 25 in 2003 for 2005 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues for 2004 and 2003 microsoft corporation accounted for 10 and 15 respectively of total revenues 

 

software and softwarerelated revenue decreased 49 or 16 million to 16 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 33 million for the year ended december 31 2004 software and softwarerelated revenue was 37 million for the year ended december 31 2003 software and softwarerelated revenue includes sales of customized software projects and technology licensing the decreases in software and softwarerelated revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects that we undertook for customers and a decrease in the number of software licenses executed with customers we do not expect software and softwarerelated revenue to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2006 

 

we had no revenue from related parties during 2005 and 2004 service and software revenue from related parties was 137000 for the year ended december 31 2003 related party revenue in 2003 represented revenue from akamai australia a joint venture with es group ventures pty ltd relating to resale commitments in june 2003 this joint venture was terminated we do not expect to have any revenue from related parties in 2006 

 

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and equityrelated compensation for network operations personnel cost of software licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software 

 

cost of revenues increased 21 or 95 million to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 462 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cost of revenues decreased 24 or 147 million to 462 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 608 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in cost of revenues for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in aggregate bandwidth costs due to higher traffic levels and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit the total cost of revenues decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of a decline in depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the depreciation from the investments we made in our network infrastructure the decline in deprecation expense in 2004 was partially offset by an increase in total bandwidth costs due to an increase in the amount of traffic delivered 

 

cost of revenues during 2005 2004 and 2003 also included credits of 12 million 10 million and 30 million respectively as a result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing 

disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future however the timing and amount of future credits if any will vary 

 

cost of revenues is comprised of the following in millions 

 

 

 

we have longterm purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and internet service providers for the years ending december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and colocation services are approximately 60 million 11 million and 409000 respectively 

 

we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2006 we expect to deliver more traffic on our network which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic however such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally we expect increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs as well as an increase in payroll and payrollrelated costs as we continue to make investments in our network to service our expanding customer base additionally with the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we expect significant increases in cost of revenues attributable to equityrelated compensation expense 

 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equityrelated compensation for research and development personnel who design develop test and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except certain software development costs requiring capitalization during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we capitalized software development costs of 85 million 75 million and 75 million respectively consisting of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 

 

research and development expenses increased 49 or 59 million to 181 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 121 million for the year ended december 31 2004 research and development expenses decreased 6 or 839000 to 121 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 130 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs due to an increase in headcount the decrease in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs including equityrelated compensation as a reflection of the impact of workforce reductions in prior years and a reduction in equity compensation as stock awards became fully vested the following table quantifies the net changes in research and development expenses over periods presented in millions 

 

 

we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2006 as we continue to increase hiring of development personnel and make investments in our core technology and refinements to our other service offerings additionally with the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we expect significant increases in research and development expense attributable to equityrelated compensation expense 

 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs equityrelated compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and service support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

 

sales and marketing expenses increased 40 or 222 million to 779 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2004 sales and marketing expenses increased 17 or 81 million to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 476 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs particularly commissions for sales and marketing personnel due to revenue growth additionally marketing and related costs increased in 2005 due to higher advertising and promotional costs as compared to 2004 the following table quantifies the net increase in sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in 2006 due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales the expected increase in hiring of sales and marketing personnel and additional expected increases in marketing costs such as advertising additionally with the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we expect significant increases in sales and marketing expenses attributable to equityrelated compensation expense 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components 

 

  

general and administrative expenses increased 13 or 60 million to 530 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2004 general and administrative expenses decreased 18 or 102 million to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 573 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth as well as an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts this increase was offset by a reduction in legal and consulting costs associated with the dismissal of the lawsuits between akamai and speedera as a result of our 

acquisition of speedera the decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2004 was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated a reduction in payroll and related costs including equity compensation as a result of equity awards becoming fully vested and reduced rent expense due to lease restructurings in prior years during 2005 and 2004 consulting and advisory services increased significantly compared to those in 2003 as a result of the costs associated with the evaluation of our internal controls in order to allow management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to our internal control over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the following table quantifies the net change in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we capitalized software development costs of 718000 and 236000 respectively consisting of external consulting fees and payroll and payrollrelated costs associated with the development of internallyused software applications once the projects are completed such costs will be amortized and included in general and administrative expenses 

 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2006 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring an increase in nonincome tax expense and an increase in rent and facilities costs as we expanded our leasing of office space in 2005 these increases will be offset by an expected reduction in legal costs additionally with the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we expect significant increases in general and administrative expenses attributable to equityrelated compensation expense 

 

amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets increased to 51 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 48000 for the year ended december 31 2004 amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2003 was 22 million the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2005 was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of speedera in june 2005 intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions were fully amortized in the first quarter of 2003 consequently there was no corresponding amortization of such assets in 2004 we expect to amortize approximately 84 million 74 million 61 million 48 million and 41 million for fiscal years 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively in connection with the speedera acquisition 

 

restructuring benefits charges we did not record any restructuring charges or benefits during 2005 or 2004 during the year ended december 31 2003 we recorded net restructuring benefits of 85 million as a result of amendments to certain real estate leases during the year ended december 31 2003 we amended or terminated three longterm leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of 161 million in cash and restricted cash as a result of these amendments to or terminations of longterm leases we reversed 96 million of previously recorded restructuring liabilities offset by a restructuring charge of 11 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility located in europe the reversals represent the difference between the previously estimated restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the landlords thereof we estimate the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors 

we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future however we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our longterm leases if we believe it to be in our best interest 

 

interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities interest income increased 98 or 21 million to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2004 interest income increased 66 or 856000 to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 13 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in interest income in 2005 and 2004 as compared to previous years was due to an increase in our invested marketable securities period over period as we generated more cash from operations and invested the proceeds from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes in 2004 and 2005 we also experienced an increase in interest rates earned on our investments in november 2005 we received proceeds of 2021 million from our public equity offering of 120 million shares of our common stock accordingly we expect interest income to increase in 2006 

 

interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense decreased 48 or 49 million to 53 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2004 interest expense decreased 44 or 81 million to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 183 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease during each of these periods was due to lower interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes at various times between december 2003 and september 2005 offset by interest payable on our 1 convertible senior notes issued in december 2003 and january 2004 during 2005 and 2004 we redeemed or repurchased 566 million and 1694 million respectively in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes as a result of these transactions we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations including deferred financing amortization will not exceed 31 million in 2006 

 

other expense income net other net expense represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains and losses on legal settlements other net expense increased 148 or 16 million to 507000 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to other net income of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 other net income increased to 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to other net expense of 44000 for the year ended december 31 2003 other net expense for the year ended december 31 2005 represented 15 million of foreign exchange losses offset by 10 million of net gains on legal settlements other net income of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 represented approximately 518000 of gains on legal settlements and 543000 of foreign exchange gains for the year ended december 31 2003 other net expense of 44000 consisted of foreign exchange losses other net expense income may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates 

 

loss gain on investments net during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we recorded a net loss on investments of 27000 and 69000 respectively on the sale of marketable securities during 2003 we recorded a net gain of 16 million of which 17 million related to the sale of equity investments in publiclytraded companies offset by losses of 55000 on investments in privatelyheld companies and sales of marketable securities we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in 2006 as we no longer hold any substantial investments in publicly or privatelyheld companies 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to 14 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2004 loss on early extinguishment of debt increased to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 21 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2005 is due to costs incurred in connection with our redemption of 566 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes during 2005 this loss of 14 million consists of 889000 in premiums above par value paid to redeem such notes and 481000 of deferred financing costs associated with redeeming the notes prior to their maturity during 2004 and 2003 we repurchased 1694 million and 740 million respectively in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 68 million and 21 million respectively 

benefit provision for income taxes benefit for income taxes increased to 2576 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to a provision for income taxes of 772000 during the year ended december 31 2004 provision for income taxes increased 23 or 143000 to 772000 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 629000 for the year ended december 31 2003 during 2005 in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recorded an income tax benefit of 2858 million the provision for income taxes for each of 2004 and 2003 was primarily related to our alternative minimum tax payment obligations and income earned in foreign jurisdictions where we were profitable 

 

as of june 30 2005 our united states and foreign net operating losses or nols and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because at the time pursuant to sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” we did not have sufficient history of taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a 12quarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations during the third quarter of 2005 we determined that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our united states and foreign nol carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other deferred tax assets as a result during the third quarter of 2005 we released a total of 3218 million of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance of the 3218 million 2581 million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations 610 million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises which was recorded as an increase in additional paidin capital on the balance sheet and approximately 27 million of the valuation release was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets 

 

as of september 30 2005 we had a remaining valuation allowance of 356 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company released the remainder of the valuation allowance except for 69 million that we will maintain because the realization of certain deferred tax assets does not meet the “more likely than not” criterion under sfas no 109 this portion of the valuation allowance primarily relates to certain state nols with a fiveyear carryover period that as of december 31 2005 we expect will expire unused the fourthquarter valuation allowance release is consistent with the requirement under apb no 28 “interim financial reporting” that we use an annualized effective tax rate for each interim period during the year including current year interim periods after a valuation allowance release has occurred the total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for 2005 was 2858 million 

 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2005 remained relatively low before considering the deferred tax valuation allowance release as discussed above however our annualized effective tax rate in future periods after 2005 is expected to significantly increase we expect that our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in 2006 will be approximately 40 

 

because of the availability of the nols discussed above a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a noncash expense consequently the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances and projections of our future provision for income taxes annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards applicable tax rates transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain therefore actual results could differ materially from our projections 

 

we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

to date we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions 

 

  

as of december 31 2005 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 3141 million of which 45 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash cash equivalents and marketable securities see “letters of credit” below 

 

cash provided by operating activities increased 316 million to 828 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 512 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash provided by operating activities increased 692 million to 512 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to cash used in operating activities of 180 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for each of 2005 and 2004 as compared to previous years was primarily due to increased service revenue and increases in deferred revenue we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenues partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries in connection with expected increases in headcount the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 

 

cash used in investing activities was 1838 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 91 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash used in investing activities was 331 million for the year ended december 31 2003 cash used in investing activities for 2005 reflects net purchases of marketable securities of 1495 million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in november 2005 additionally cash used in investing activities for 2005 includes capital expenditures of 362 million consisting of the capitalization of the purchase of network infrastructure equipment and internaluse software development costs related to our current and future service offerings these investments were offset by 17 million of cash acquired through the speedera acquisition and a decrease of 202000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects proceeds from net sales and maturities of investments of 241 million offset by capital expenditures of 201 million during 2004 cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of 50 million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of 50 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of 96000 in restricted investments previously held for security deposits cash used in investing activities for 2003 reflects net purchases of investments of 193 million an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase 50 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and capital expenditures of 89 million for 2006 we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities to be approximately the same percentage of revenues as 2005 

 

cash provided by financing activities was 1591 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately 1319 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash provided by financing activities was 1052 million for the year ended december 31 2003 cash provided by financing activities in 2005 reflects net proceeds from our november 2005 equity offering of 2021 million and 

proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 145 million offset by payments made to redeem 566 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on capital lease obligations of 818000 cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects payments for the repurchase of approximately 1694 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of 543000 offset by net proceeds received from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes of 243 million and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 138 million cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects net proceeds from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes of 1698 million proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 86 million settlement of notes receivable for stock of 23 million offset by payments for the repurchase of 740 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of 14 million 

 

changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenue accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sales of equity investments and similar events 

 

the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 

 

 

we believe based on our current business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 3141 million and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders see “risk factors” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of potential dilution 

contractual obligations contingent liabilities and commercial commitments 

 

the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2005 over the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 

 

 

letters of credit 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had outstanding 45 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to longterm facility leases the letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities of which 38 million are classified as longterm marketable securities and 730000 are classified as shortterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet dated as of december 31 2005 the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit these restrictions are expected to lapse through may 2011 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors stockholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 

 

the conversion features of our 1 convertible senior notes are equitylinked derivatives as such we recognize these instruments as offbalance sheet arrangements the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholder’s equity therefore these instruments meet the scope exception of paragraph 11a of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas no 133 see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

litigation 

 

we are party to litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “legal proceedings” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on litigation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” effective on january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values as of the date of grant the adoption of this statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we disclosed the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options only in the notes to the financial statements which is no longer permitted see equityrelated compensation in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

sfas no 123r applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified repurchased or canceled after the effective date of adoption additionally compensation costs for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date of adoption shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered the compensation cost for that portion of such awards shall be based on the grantdate fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 changes to the grantdate fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded the compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of our adoption of sfas 123r using the attribution method that was used under sfas no 123 which was the straightline method any unearned or deferred compensation related to those earlier awards shall be written off against the appropriate equity accounts additionally common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option 

 

we adopted sfas no 123r on a modified prospective basis beginning january 1 2006 accordingly the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on our results of operations increasing cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses we currently estimate that adoption of the statement will reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately 014 in 2006 however the amount may change based upon the number and value of additional stock option grants and forfeiture rates we have utilized the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the value of our stock options for more information on the impact of expensing stock options for the three years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 see equityrelated compensation in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

sfas no 123r also changes the reporting of taxrelated amounts within the statement of cash flows the gross amount of any windfall tax benefits resulting from stockbased compensation will be reported as cash flows from financing activities under the indirect method of presentation of the statement of cash flows any shortfalls resulting from the writeoff of deferred tax assets will be reported in net income and classified within the change of deferred income taxes in the operating section of the statement of cash flows

1 meeting the challenges of the internet 

  the internet has matured into a key tool for companies public sector agencies and other entities to conduct business and reach the public the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s business communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet due to many challenges including 

   in addition to the challenges inherent in the internet companies and other entities face internal technology challenges driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies companies need an agile internetfacing infrastructure that costeffectively meets realtime strategic and business objectives as public sector agencies migrate more and more of their processes from inperson mail or phone services to internetbased applications it has become essential that their websites be more reliable and that they deliver their content and applications more efficiently to their constituents at the same time budget limitations may preclude public sector agencies from developing their own infrastructure for internetfacing applications enterprises of all types are confronted with the increasingly widespread use of broadband connectivity leading to more users requesting more different types of rich content as a result there is greater stress on centralized infrastructures 

  akamai meets these challenges in ways that are designed to help companies and government agencies increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the performance reliability and security of their internet facing operations 

  superior performance customers seeking to remain competitive and meet the challenges of globalization look to akamai’s edgeplatform to reduce or eliminate downtime and poor performance through a combination of people processes and technology akamai offers solutions designed to achieve reliability stability and predictability without the need for our customers to spend a lot of money to develop their own internetrelated infrastructure instead we have a presence in hundreds of networks around the world so that content can be delivered from akamai servers located closer to website visitors — from what we call the edge of the internet we are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations at the same time our customers have access to control features to ensure that the content served to end users is current and is delivered efficiently without the need for end users to traverse the internet to the origin server 

  scalability many akamai customers experience seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites on a larger scale almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points during the day in both instances it can be difficult and expensive to plan for and deploy solutions against such peaks and valleys the akamai edgeplatform has the robustness and flexibility to handle planned and unplanned peaks without additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of our customers as a result we are able to provide an on demand solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the face of unpredictable traffic spikes which helps them avoid expensive overinvestment in a centralized internetfacing infrastructure 

  security security may be the most significant challenge facing use of the internet for business and government processes today that’s because security threats — in the form of attacks viruses worms and intrusions — can impact every measure of performance including speed reliability customer confidence and information security unlike traditional security strategies that can impact performance negatively akamai’s edgeplatform is designed to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents and anomalies we rely on both builtin defense mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so performance is not compromised 

2 the akamai edgeplatform 

  the edgeplatform is the foundation of akamai’s business solutions we believe akamai has deployed the world’s largest globally distributed computing platform with more than 15000 servers in 69 countries to make this widereaching deployment effective the edgeplatform includes specialized technologies such as advanced routing load balancing data collection and monitoring through a combination of architecture and services akamai’s edgeplatform helps our customers implement their web strategy quickly without adding equipment cost or complexity to their existing information technology or it infrastructure 

  the key to the edgeplatform’s effectiveness is its use of a distributed computing model in which both content and computing applications are delivered across a system of widely distributed networks of servers and processed at the most efficient places within the network to implement this model our servers are deployed in more than 950 networks including large backbone network providers medium and small isps cable modem and satellite providers universities and other networks we also deploy our servers at smaller and mediumsized domestic and international isps through our akamai accelerated network program under this program we offer use of our servers to isps in exchange we typically do not pay for rack space to house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content from our servers to internet users by hosting our servers isps gain access to popular content from the internet that is served from our platform as a result when this content is requested by a user the isp does not need to pay for the bandwidth otherwise necessary to retrieve the content from the originating website we also have more than 500 peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end user networks lowering latency and packet loss while also giving us more options for delivery during network congestion or failures 

  our edgeplatform components for content and application delivery are designed so that sites download and run more quickly withstand security threats and reliably process applications and deliver content to anywhere in the world our intelligent routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors experience fast page loading and content assembly wherever they are on the internet regardless of global or local traffic conditions customers are also able to control the extent of their use of akamai services to scale on demand using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as is required to support widely varying traffic and rapid ebusiness growth without expensive and complex infrastructure buildout

  with the edgeplatform as our backbone we offer services and solutions for content and application delivery application performance services on demand managed services and business performance management services

 application performance services 

  application performance services improve the performance of highly dynamic content common on corporate extranets and wide area networks traditionally this market has been addressed primarily by hardware and software products we believe our approach offers a more costeffective and comprehensive solution in this area without customers having to make significant infrastructure investments 

  one example of an akamai application performance service is our web application accelerator service a customer might use this service to improve the operation of an online reservations application by tying such an application to the akamai edgeplatform a customer can enjoy high levels of performance through connection and route optimization techniques that dynamically avoid problem spots on the internet 

  in addition our firstpoint solution is designed to provide application performance improvement for companies with mirrored websites that require traffic management for multiple application servers and databases with the firstpoint service enterprises and organizations with a geographically distributed web infrastructure can take advantage of realtime internet performance information to distribute incoming requests to an optimal website 

on demand managed services 

  akamai’s on demand managed services including akamai edgecomputing and net storage offerings enable enterprises to dramatically reduce the need for an internal infrastructure to handle unpredictable levels of internet traffic with access to the edgeplatform customers are able to rapidly launch and deploy new applications worldwide with on demand availability and scalability but on a costeffective basis for example akamai on demand events provides an on demand platform for running promotional websites — through macromedia flash® promotions site search sweepstakes polls regional offers or other innovative applications that create a positive brand experience 

  akamai’s edgecomputing service enables enterprises to deliver java j2ee web applications that scale on demand and perform faster and more reliably worldwide than if relying on their internal it infrastructures at the same time this reduces the demands on their own it infrastructures and simplifies their support requirements by enabling internetbased applications that improve promotion and sales customer service and vendor and partner management our customers are better positioned to compete more effectively and reduce business costs

  edgecontrol tools can be integrated with existing enterprise management systems allowing our customers to manage their distributed content and applications via a common interface edgecontrol also provides integration with third party network management tools including those offered by ibm hewlettpackard and bmc software having created one of the industry’s first examples of a commercially proven utility computing platform akamai now provides a global network of servers that can be utilized by a customer on demand allowing our customers to manage usage troubleshooting monitoring and reporting based on their individual business requirements

  to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai brand we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements trade shows strategic partnerships and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2004 we had 29 employees in our global marketing organization 

research and development 

  our research and development organization is continuously enhancing and improving our existing services strengthening our network and creating new services in response to our customers’ needs and market demand as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 164 employees in our research and development organization many of whom hold advanced degrees in their field our research and development expenses were 121 million 130 million and 218 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition for each of the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 we capitalized 75 million net of impairments of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network for the year ended december 31 2002 60 million was capitalized 

6 competition 

  the market for our services remains relatively new intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of 

   we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of these companies resell our services we also compete with companies that host online conferences using proprietary conferencing applications finally potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai 

proprietary rights and licensing 

  our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states patents covering our content delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology two of these patent applications have now been issued these patents will expire in 2018 we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 

employees 

  as of december 31 2004 we had a total of 605 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good 

factors affecting future operating results 

  the following are certain of the important factors that could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

   we compete in markets that are new intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do other competitors may attract customers by offering services that may be perceived as less sophisticated versions of our services at lower prices than those we charge our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their services with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer or internet service providers from installing our servers in addition potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an external provider like akamai increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

   prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years we expect that this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we serve consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional services and features to our existing edgesuite delivery customers our revenues and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

   the year ended december 31 2004 was the first fiscal year during which we achieved profitability as measured in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative interest and other expenses therefore we will need to generate higher revenues to maintain profitability there are numerous factors that could alone or in combination with other factors impede our ability to increase revenues andor moderate expenses including 

 8 

 

   the market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new services into existing and emerging markets the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to developing new services or enhancements to our existing services before knowing whether our investments will result in services the market will accept in addition in an effort to control expenses our spending on research and development decreased over the past three years furthermore we may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources failures in execution or market acceptance of new services we introduce could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenues and earnings 

   we have longterm debt as of december 31 2004 our total longterm debt was approximately 2566 million of which 566 million is due on june 30 2007 and our stockholders’ deficit was approximately 1259 million our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes in addition if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due we would be in default under the terms of our loans which would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which in turn would seriously harm our business 

   our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of application and content delivery services over the internet for our core services we currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard our customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that day our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the necessary capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users for example approximately four percent of our customers experienced a brief delay in delivery of services on june 15 2004 as a result of a denial of service resulting from an attack by hackers on our network we believe this attack targeted several wellknown websites that are customers of akamai although we have taken steps to enhance our ability to prevent the recurrence of such an incident there can be no assurance that similar attacks will not be attempted in the future that our enhanced security measures will be effective or that a successful attack would not be more damaging any widespread loss or interruption of our network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

   our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers we believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons for example a number of these network providers are operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws as a result there is uncertainty about whether such providers or others that enter into bankruptcy will be able to continue to provide services to us any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all our business and financial results could suffer in addition our telecommunications and network providers typically provide rack space for our servers damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

   our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services we may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely manner if we are unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be identified or if there are unidentified errors that allow persons to improperly access our services we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

   on march 16 2005 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger providing for our acquisition of speedera networks inc or speedera in exchange for the issuance of approximately 12 million shares of our common stock closing of the merger is subject to regulatory approval as well as the approval of speedera’s stockholders the process of obtaining such approval could be expensive and timeconsuming if we are unable to obtain or are significantly delayed in obtaining such approvals or are otherwise unable to complete the merger we would have devoted substantial resources and management attention without any accompanying benefit in such an event our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

   we have made acquisitions of other companies in the past and may enter into business combinations and acquisitions in addition to the proposed speedera acquisition in the future acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses we face all of these risks in connection with the proposed speedera acquisition if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a productive result in addition with future acquisitions we could use substantial portions of our available cash or as in the proposed speedera merger transaction make dilutive issuances of securities future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could also have an adverse effect on our ability to remain profitable 

   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about among other things taxes revenue recognition capitalization of internaluse software contingent obligations doubtful accounts and restructuring charges among other things these estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructuring charges and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct we may need to accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

   we have licensed technology from mit covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our core technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

   other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services companies providing internetrelated products and services are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights particularly patent rights we have been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging that we have violated other companies’ intellectual property rights any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following 

   if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have brought numerous lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be 

11 challenged invalidated or circumvented furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

   our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that they rely on in implementing our business plan none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we have a “key person” life insurance policy covering only the life of f thomson leighton our chief scientist and a member of our board of directors the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

   we have operations in several foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include 

 

   if our revenues decrease or grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues we may need to obtain funding from outside sources if we are unable to obtain this funding our business would be materially and adversely affected in addition even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us if at all 

   laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online this could negatively affect the businesses of our customers and reduce their demand for our services tax laws that might apply to our 

12 servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes that would adversely affect our continued profitability internetrelated laws however remain largely unsettled even in areas where there has been some legislative action the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or our operations or interpretations of existing law could adversely affect our business 

   provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction without the approval of our board of directors 

   we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the exchange act any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

   in the ordinary course of business we may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  between july 2 2001 and november 7 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 and the exchange act primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single 

13 consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 a special litigation committee of akamai’s board of directors authorized management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated among class plaintiffs all issuer defendants and their insurers the parties negotiated a settlement which is subject to approval by the court on february 15 2005 the court issued an opinion and order preliminarily approving the settlement provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in the original settlement agreement we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and if the settlement is not finalized and approved we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously an adverse resolution of the action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit 

  in february 2002 we filed suit against speedera networks inc or speedera in federal court in massachusetts alleging patent infringement and false advertising by speedera in april 2003 we amended our complaint to include an allegation that speedera infringes a newlyissued content delivery patent held by mit and licensed to akamai in response speedera filed a counterclaim in this case alleging that akamai has infringed a speedera patent relating to the combined provision of traffic management and content delivery services in june 2004 speedera amended its counterclaim to include a second patent covering a similar service it offers we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this counterclaim we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and intend to contest them vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this counterclaim 

  in june 2002 we filed suit against speedera in california superior court alleging theft of akamai trade secrets from an independent company that provides website performance testing services in connection with this suit in september 2002 the court issued a preliminary injunction to restrain speedera from continuing to access our confidential information from the independent company’s database and from using any data obtained from such access in october 2002 speedera filed a crossclaim against us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and alleging that we engaged in various unfair trade practices made false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair competition a trial date has been set for april 18 2005 we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in speedera’s crossclaim and intend to contest the allegations vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this crossclaim 

  in november 2002 we filed suit against speedera in federal court in massachusetts for infringement of a patent held by akamai in january 2003 speedera filed a counterclaim in this case alleging that akamai has infringed a patent held by speedera we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and intend to contest them vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this counterclaim

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

  we primarily derive revenue from the sale of akamai services to customers executing contracts having terms of one year or longer which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services features and functions our customers purchase at the same time we must ensure that our expenses do not increase at the same rate as our revenue accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology see “factors affecting future operating results” elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  our improved financial results in 2004 as compared to 2003 and 2002 reflect our improvements in our ability to increase our monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated 

   we were profitable during the year ended december 31 2004 the first full fiscal year during which we had net income we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the future 

 17 

   based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and events we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly basis during 2005 however our future results will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled “factors affecting future operating results” including our ability to

 as a result there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives 

recent events 

  on march 16 2005 we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common and preferred stock including vested and unvested stock options of speedera by issuing approximately 12 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately 130 million based on the closing stock price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on march 15 2005 the acquisition is expected to be accounted for by us under the purchase method of accounting and is expected to close during the quarter ended june 30 2005 subject to various regulatory approvals the merger agreement provides for a stay of all existing litigation between speedera and us until the closing of the merger or any earlier termination of the merger agreement upon the closing all lawsuits between speedera and us would be released 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable reserves investments capitalized internaluse software costs intangible assets income and other taxes useful lives of property and equipment restructuring accruals and contingent obligations we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

   we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make highly judgemental estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and requires us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 

 

   at the inception of a customer contract for service we make an estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the services provided we base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check financial review the receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history with the customer upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all unpaid invoices to that customer and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received changes in our estimates and judgments of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 

  we primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum for these 

19 services we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the service has been delivered to the customer the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured should a customer’s usage exceed the monthly minimum we recognize revenue for that excess in the period of the usage we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete events or based solely on usage for these services we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties the fee is fixed or determinable the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 

  we periodically enter into multielement service arrangements when we enter into such arrangements each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements for example objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the element when sold separately if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period for most multielement service arrangements to date the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable therefore all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period 

  we license software under perpetual and term license agreements we apply the provisions of statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modifications of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” as prescribed by this guidance we apply the residual method of accounting the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop 972 the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop 972 are met 

  we also sell our services through a reseller channel assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s contracted nonrefundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 

  we recognize revenue from fixedfee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin “arb” no 45 “longterm constructiontype contracts” and with the applicable guidance provided by sop 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project in certain customer arrangements we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change at the outset of a fixedfee arrangement if we are not able to estimate the total costtocomplete nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones we account for the arrangement using the completedcontract method of accounting under this method we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixedfee contract indicates a loss we will record the loss immediately 

  deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees deferred installation and activation setup fees amounts billed under extended payment terms and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements 

   trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest in addition to trade accounts receivable our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue 

20 recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts cash basis customers and service credits increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers where collection is no longer assured the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received the reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business as well as for billing disputes these credits result in a reduction to revenues decreases to the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to customers which have a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable 

  estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customerspecific accountbyaccount basis the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve until we receive consistent payments we evaluate customer receivable balances and reserves on a monthly basis in addition we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for service credits reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits these credits typically relate to management’s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments we do not have any offbalance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

   from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless both the fair values of our services delivered to the customer and of the vendor’s product or service we receive can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable 

   we periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is otherthantemporary we consider several factors that may trigger an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time the investment’s value has been below carrying value and the financial results of the entity in which we invest when we conclude that the reduction is otherthantemporary the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is otherthantemporary could increase loss on investments 

   we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such a triggering event occurs we compare the carrying amount of the longlived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

   when we vacate a facility subject to a noncancelable longterm lease we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us in the latter case we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income to date we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan beginning in 2003 in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we record restructuring liabilities discounted at the appropriate rate for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 

  as of december 31 2004 we had 36 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities in 2003 we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of 96 million we expect that approximately 14 million of the amount accrued as of december 31 2004 will be paid within 12 months in the event that we are able to sublease our restructured space we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable 

   we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

   we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences we provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in past years despite our profitability in 2004 as of december 31 2004 we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized a decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit an increase in total assets and stockholder’s equity and could have a significant impact on earnings in future periods 

  we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated 

   we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees who devote time to the development of internaluse software projects if the project is an enhancement to previously developed software we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus 

22 qualifying the work incurred for capitalization once the project is complete we must estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

results of operations 

  revenues total revenues increased 30 or 488 million to 2100 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 1613 million for the year ended december 31 2003 total revenues increased 11 or 163 million to 1613 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 1450 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in total revenues for 2004 as compared to 2003 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of 494 million partially offset by a reduction in software and softwarerelated revenue of 477000 the increase in total revenues for 2003 as compared to 2002 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of 287 million partially offset by a reduction in software and softwarerelated revenue of 28 million and related party revenue of 97 million 

  service revenue which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services increased 31 or 494 million to 2068 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 1574 million for the year ended december 31 2003 service revenue was 1287 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and in an increase in the average revenue per customer we believe these increases are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers as of december 31 2004 we had 1310 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1126 as of december 31 2003 and 955 as of december 31 2002 

  for 2004 and 2003 19 and 16 respectively of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 14 and 13 of overall revenues respectively was derived from operations in europe for 2002 13 of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 10 of overall revenues was derived from operations in europe no single country accounted for 10 or more of revenues derived outside of the united states during these periods resellers accounted for 27 of revenues in 2004 25 in 2003 and 24 in 2002 for 2004 and 2003 microsoft corporation accounted for 10 and 15 respectively of total revenues for 2002 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenues 

  in september 2004 we entered into an amendment to our agreement with microsoft corporation to adjust the pricing and commitment levels in addition we also amended the service level agreement guarantees applicable to the various services purchased by microsoft the term of the agreement runs until september 2005 but may be renewed by the parties microsoft will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by 50 for extensions of the term of the agreement and convert the contract to a monthtomonth term after september 2005 if the parties fail to reach agreement as to appropriate price and service level changes at such time 

  software and softwarerelated revenue decreased 13 or 477000 to 33 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 37 million for the year ended december 31 2003 software and softwarerelated revenue was 65 million for the year ended december 31 2002 software and softwarerelated revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under longterm contracts the decreases in software and softwarerelated revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects performed and a decrease in the number of software and other technology licenses executed as we focused on our core services business we do not expect software and softwarerelated revenue to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2005 

  we had no revenue from related parties during 2004 service and software revenue from related parties was 137000 and 98 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the reduction in revenue from related parties in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to revenue in 2002 from 

23 sockeye networks inc akamai technologies japan kk or akamai japan and softbank broadband media or sbbm a coinvestor in akamai japan with no associated revenue from those parties in 2003 or 2004 related party revenue in 2003 represents revenue from akamai australia a joint venture with es group ventures pty ltd relating to resale commitments in december 2002 and june 2003 the joint ventures of akamai japan and akamai australia respectively were terminated in 2003 we formed a whollyowned subsidiary in japan we do not expect to have any revenue from related parties in 2005 

  cost of revenues cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and equityrelated compensation for network operations personnel cost of licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software costs 

  cost of revenues decreased 24 or 147 million to 462 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 608 million for the year ended december 31 2003 cost of revenues decreased 29 or 243 million to 608 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 852 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the total cost of revenues decrease for both periods is primarily a result of a decline in depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the depreciation from the recent investments we have made in our network infrastructure in 2004 however a portion of this decrease in deprecation expense was offset by an increase in total bandwidth costs as a result of higher traffic delivered traffic delivered over our network increased significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003 despite this increase in traffic overall bandwidth costs have continued to increase at a lower rate because we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit cost of revenues decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 by 243 million primarily as a result of a reduction in depreciation of network equipment lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic 

  cost of revenues during 2004 2003 and 2002 also included credits received of approximately 10 million 30 million and 56 million respectively as a result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to monitor and reduce our network costs however the timing and amount of these credits if any will vary 

  cost of revenues is comprised of the following in millions 

   we have longterm commitments for bandwidth usage and colocation with various networks and isps for the years ending december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 the minimum commitments are approximately 97 million 456000 and 41000 respectively 

  we believe cost of revenues will increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 we expect that bandwidth costs will increase slightly as a result of higher expenses associated with increased traffic on our network offset by expected lower bandwidth costs per unit additionally we expect increases in depreciation of our network equipment and amortization of internaluse software development costs as well as an increase in payroll and payrollrelated costs as we continue to make investments in our network our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005 

24   research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equityrelated compensation for research and development personnel who design develop test and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except certain software development costs requiring capitalization during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we capitalized software development costs of 75 million 75 million and 60 million respectively consisting of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years 

  research and development expenses decreased 6 or 839000 to 121 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 130 million for the year ended december 31 2003 research and development expenses decreased 40 or 88 million to 130 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 218 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease in 2004 as compared to 2003 as well as 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs including equityrelated compensation as a result of the impact of workforce reductions in 2002 and reduction of equity compensation as stock awards have become fully vested the following table quantifies the net reduction in research and development expenses over periods presented in millions 

   we believe that research and development expenses will increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 as we continue to increase hiring of development personnel our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005 

  sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs equityrelated compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing sales and service support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

  sales and marketing expenses increased 17 or 81 million to 557 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 476 million for the year ended december 31 2003 sales and marketing expenses decreased 27 or 172 million to 476 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 648 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to a rise in payroll and payrollrelated costs particularly commissions as a result of revenue growth during 2004 the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a reduction in payroll and payrollrelated costs including decreases in equityrelated compensation attributable to reductions in headcount in 2002 sales and marketing during 2003 also decreased as a result of reductions in advertising costs associated with an agreement between cnn news group and akamai which expired in the fourth quarter of 2002 the following table quantifies the net increase and decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions 

 25   we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an expected increase in commissions as a result of higher forecasted sales an increase in hiring of sales personnel and an expected increase in marketing costs our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005 

  general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally payroll and related costs including equityrelated compensation and related expenses for executive finance business applications network management human resources and other administrative personnel fees for professional services nonincome related taxes the provision for doubtful accounts and rent and other facilityrelated expenditures for leased properties during the year ended december 31 2004 we capitalized software development costs of approximately 200000 consisting of external consulting and payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internallyused software applications 

  general and administrative expenses decreased 18 or 102 million to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 573 million for the year ended december 31 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased 42 or 409 million to 573 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 981 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease in general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated a reduction in payroll and related costs including equity compensation as a result of equity awards becoming fully vested and reduced rent expense as a result of the impact of restructurings that occurred in previous years during 2004 however consulting and advisory services increased significantly compared to 2003 as a result of the costs associated with the evaluation of our internal controls in order to allow management to report on and our independent auditors to attest to our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the following table quantifies the net reduction in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions 

   we expect general and administrative expenses to slightly increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to ongoing litigation costs associated with trials currently scheduled to occur in 2005 if our proposed acquisition of speedera is completed however we expect our litigation costs to be greatly reduced and our overall general and administrative expenses to be about the same in 2005 as compared to 2004 our expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing sfas no 123r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005 

  amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights amortization of other intangible assets decreased 98 or 22 million to 48000 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2003 amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2002 was 119 million intangible assets acquired in business combinations were fully amortized as of the end of the first quarter of 2003 therefore there was no corresponding amortization of such intangibles assets in the remainder of 2003 or in 2004 we expect to 

26 amortize approximately 48000 of intangible assets related to acquired license rights in 2005 and in each year thereafter through 2008 during which they will become fully amortized 

  restructuring charges benefits we did not record any restructuring charges or benefits during the year ended december 31 2004 during the year ended december 31 2003 we recorded net restructuring benefits of 85 million as a result of amendments to certain lease agreements during the year ended december 31 2003 we amended or terminated three longterm leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of 161 million in cash and restricted cash as a result of amendments to or terminations of longterm leases we reversed 96 million of previously recorded restructuring liabilities offset by a restructuring charge of 11 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility located in europe the reversals represent the difference between the previously estimated restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the landlords thereof beginning in 2004 our monthly rental payments have been reduced to a lower amount more aligned with current market rates 

  during the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 458 million which represents 36 million for employee severance benefits and 422 million attributable to facility leases and longlived asset impairments during the year ended december 31 2002 in connection with the termination of our facility leases for 500 and 600 technology square in cambridge massachusetts we recorded a restructuring charge of 80 million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued also during the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 297 million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under noncancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties in addition we impaired leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures deposits deferred rent and other longlived assets related to these facilities in the amount of 45 million 

  the following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases in millions 

   the restructuring liabilities will be fully paid through august 2007 we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future however we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our longterm leases if we believe it to be in our and our stockholders’ best interests we have estimated the 

27 amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors 

  interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest earned on notes receivable for stock interest income increased 66 or 856000 to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 13 million for the year ended december 31 2003 interest income decreased 57 or 17 million to 13 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in interest income for the year ended december 31 2004 was a result of an increase in our invested shortterm and longterm marketable securities balance during the course of 2004 the decrease in interest income for 2003 as compared to 2002 was the result in a decrease in our holdings of shortterm and longterm marketable securities and a decrease in interest rates 

  interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs interest expense decreased 44 or 81 million to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 183 million for the year ended december 31 2003 for the year ended december 31 2003 interest expense remained relatively flat at 183 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease during the year ended december 31 2004 was due to lower interest expense as a result of our repurchases of a substantial portion of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes in december 2003 and at various times in 2004 offset by interest payable on our 1 convertible senior notes issued in december 2003 and january 2004 during 2004 we repurchased 1694 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes as a result of these transactions we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations including deferred financing amortization and capital lease interest expense will not exceed 70 million in 2005 

  other income expense net net other income expense represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains on legal settlements other net income of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2004 represents approximately 518000 of gains on legal settlements and 543000 of foreign exchange gains for the year ended december 31 2003 other net expense was 44000 as compared to other net income of 68000 for the year ended december 31 2002 the difference between 2003 and 2002 is attributable to exchange rate fluctuations net other income expense may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates 

  loss gain on investments net during the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded a net loss on investments of 69000 on the sale of marketable securities during 2003 we recorded a net gain of 16 million of which 17 million related to the sale of equity investments in publiclytraded companies offset by losses of approximately 55000 on investments in privatelyheld companies and sale of marketable securities loss on investments in 2002 of approximately 61 million included a loss of approximately 43 million related to our investment in netaxs inc a related party which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between netaxs and fastnet corporation in april 2002 in addition loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of 24 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value the loss on investments was partially offset by a gain of 400000 on the sale of our equity interest in akamai japan to sbbm and by approximately 149000 of realized investment gains we do not expect significant gain or losses on investments as we no longer hold investments in publicly or privatelyheld companies 

  loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt increased 47 million or 223 to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 21 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt is a result of costs incurred in connection with our repurchase of 1694 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes during 2004 this loss of 68 million consists of the reduction of 25 million of deferred financing costs associated with repurchases of notes prior to their maturity 28 million in premiums above par value paid to repurchase such notes and 15 million of advisory services and offering costs incurred in connection with the repurchases 

  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased 143000 or 23 to 772000 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 629000 for the year ended december 31 2003 provision for 

28 income taxes for the year ended december 31 2002 was 492000 the provision for income taxes during all periods presented relates to foreign income taxes which may fluctuate in the future based upon changes in foreign income despite our profitability in 2004 as of december 31 2004 we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized a decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit 

liquidity and capital resources 

  to date we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions 

   as of december 31 2004 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 1084 million of which 46 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash cash equivalents and marketable securities see “letters of credit” below 

  cash provided by operating activities increased 692 million to 512 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to cash used in operating activities of 180 million for the year ended december 31 2003 cash used in operating activities decreased 478 million to 180 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 658 million for the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to the increase in cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings during 2004 as well as a decrease in payments made on accrued restructuring liabilities during the period the decrease in cash used in operating activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1080 million in net losses before noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization loss on investments equityrelated compensation and loss on early extinguishment of debt we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to remain positive as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenue billings and a reduction in payments towards our real estate restructuring liabilities partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays due to expected increases in headcount however the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 

  cash provided by investing activities was 91 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to cash used in investing activities of 331 million for the year ended december 31 2003 cash provided by investing activities was 380 million for the year ended december 31 2002 cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects proceeds from net purchases sales and maturities of investments of 241 million offset by capital expenditures of 201 million consisting of the capitalization of internaluse software development costs related to our current and future service offerings and purchase of network infrastructure equipment during 2004 cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of 50 million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of 50 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of 96000 in restricted cash previously held for security deposits the increase in cash provided by investing activities for 2004 as compared to cash used in investing activities for 2003 was primarily due to an increase in the proceeds from net purchases sales and maturities of investments offset by an increase in capital expenditures in 2004 cash used in investing activities for 2003 

29 reflects net purchases sales and maturities of investments of 193 million an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase 50 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and capital expenditures including capitalization of internaluse software development costs of 89 million cash provided by investing activities for 2002 reflects proceeds from net purchases sales and maturities of investments of 584 million less capital expenditures of 142 million including capitalization of internaluse software development costs cash provided by investing activities during 2002 also includes a payment of 65 million to cnn news group to settle an obligation resulting from our acquisition of intervu inc in april 2000 we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 10 to 12 of revenues in 2005 

  cash used in financing activities was 1319 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to cash provided by financing activities of approximately 1052 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and approximately 12 million for the year ended december 31 2002 cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects payments for the repurchase of approximately 1694 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of 543000 offset by proceeds received from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes net of financing costs of 243 million and issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 138 million cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects proceeds received from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes net of financing costs of 1698 million issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 86 million settlement of notes receivable for stock of 23 million offset by payments for the repurchase of 740 million in principal amount of our 5 1  2  convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of 14 million cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans of 28 million and payments on our capital lease obligations of 16 million cash received from the issuance of common stock under equity compensation plans increased in 2004 as compared to prior years as a result of more option exercises in 2004 

  changes in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenues accounts payable accounts receivable and various accrued expenses as well as changes in our capital and financial structure including debt repurchases and issuances stock option exercises sale of equity investments and settlements of notes receivable for stock 

  the following table represents the net outflow of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions 

 30   we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 1084 million and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities we may seek to retire or refinance our longterm debt with cash equity or a combination thereof if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders see “factors affecting future operating results” 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2004 over the next five years and thereafter in millions 

 letters of credit

31 recent accounting pronouncements 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment revised 2004” which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of sharebased payments is no longer an alternative sfas no 123r is effective for all stockbased awards granted on or after july 1 2005 we expect to adopt this standard in july 2005 under the modified prospective transition method under this method a company records compensation expense for all new awards and awards modified repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date in addition companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 123r to our consolidated results of operations but expect that the adoption will have a material impact 

  in september 2004 the emerging issues task force or the eitf reached consensus on issue 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” or eitf 048 eitf 048 provides guidance on when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt securities with a market trigger should be included in diluted earnings per share or eps the guidance states that these securities should be treated the same as other convertible securities and included in diluted eps computation regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met eitf 048 is effective for all periods ending after december 15 2004 and is applied retrospectively as a result of the adoption of eitf 048 our 1 convertible senior notes convertible into 129 million shares are now included in our diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended december 31 2004 which has resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of 001 for that period

  we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our periodic reports and amendments to those periodic reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission industry background   the end of the 20th century witnessed the explosive growth of the internet and the emergence of ebusiness ebusiness is the use of the internet to streamline processes improve productivity and increase efficiencies enabling enterprises to communicate more effectively with customers vendors and partners connect backend data systems and transact commerce in a secure manner the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s business communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet as a result of many potential bottlenecks including    driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies ebusiness is becoming a critical component for corporate enterprises these trends require enterprises to rely on an agile ebusiness infrastructure to meet their realtime strategic and business objectives we expect enterprises to favor a more decentralized information technology architecture to support their goals of disaster recovery high availability denialofservice mitigation and back up we also anticipate that enterprises will continue to expand their use of technologies that allow an enterprise to conduct business over the internet which are referred to as internet protocol or ip technologies   in recent years government agencies have begun to migrate more and more of their processes from inperson mail or phone services to internetbased applications as a result it has become essential to many public sector bodies that their websites be more reliable and that they deliver their content and applications more efficiently to their constituents at the same time budget cuts preclude development of an expensive selfmanaged infrastructure we expect that an increasing number of public sector entities will look to third party content and application delivery providers like akamai to solve these challenges our solutions   akamai provides proven services and solutions for predictable scalable and secure ebusiness transactions without the cost of building out infrastructure built on the globally distributed akamai edgeplatform akamai solutions extend web operations anywhere anytime and improve insight and management of applications and content through our edgecontrol sm technology   these services and solutions enable customers to reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a uniform ip infrastructure while ensuring superior performance reliability scalability and manageability forming the core of these services are our edgesuite and edgecomputing offerings suites of services that allows enterprises to maximize performance and minimize cost while distributing their internetrelated content and applications using ip technology   akamai also offers a set of solutions aimed at solving customers’ business problems including online commerce web site security ebusiness continuity and optimized extranets these solutions combine various 2 features and capabilities of the edgesuite and edgecomputing services in a way that uniquely addresses each of these problem sets 

 

   by moving electronic content and applications closer to our customers’ end users our edgesuite service allows enterprises to improve the enduser experience boost reliability and scalability and reduce the cost of their ebusiness infrastructure we believe that our edgesuite offering is the only service available in the industry capable of providing the benefits of distributed performance to an enterprise’s entire website and all aspects of its applications our edgesuite service reduces the amount of ip infrastructure that our customers must implement to maintain a global internet presence while site owners maintain a control copy of their applications and content our edgesuite service provides global delivery load balancing and storage of these applications and content enabling businesses to focus valuable resources on strategic matters rather than tactical infrastructure issues   customers of our edgesuite service have access to the following service features            3            4 

 

   enterprises can position themselves to grow revenue and market share compete more effectively and reduce business costs by enabling world wide web applications that improve promotion and sales customer service and vendor and partner management however most enterprise it infrastructures are not equipped to handle these applications which can include store dealer locators promotional contests search functionality user registration product pricing configurators and other key tools akamai edgecomputing enables enterprises to deliver java j2ee web applications that scale on demand and perform faster and more reliably worldwide than they could relying on their internal it infrastructures at the same time we help them reduce the demands on their own it infrastructures and simplify their support requirements   edgecomputing allows enterprises to extend more of their applications into the network closer to end users including customers partners suppliers and employees by adding application server capabilities and support for application and development frameworks such as java j2ee and microsoft net we are striving to become a pervasive distributed and standardsbased high performance deployment platform for enterprise applications internetbased services and website content of all kinds   in may 2003 we launched akamai edgecomputing sm powered by ibm websphere® a new solution that enables enterprises to deploy javabased software applications over the akamai network on a “payasyougo” basis our customers can now extend applications built on ibm’s websphere internet infrastructure software to akamai’s distributed network of servers to handle everyday web application traffic and spikes in demand specific application functions such as creating and viewing a personalized portal can now be securely “pushed” to the edge of our network and executed closer to the user 

 

   akamai online commerce is a highly secure on demand business solution that helps customers more efficiently conduct ebusiness transactions by meeting peak performance needs to deliver a positive customer experience increasing conversion rates and ensuring transaction completion while reducing infrastructure buildout costs   akamai ebusiness continuity is an ebusiness solution designed to provide internetenabled enterprises with 100 availability of their most critical web operations providing online business continuity by distributing applications over a global network   akamai site security is a set of controls that help protect ebusinesses against malicious and random traffic from hackers worms and viruses while providing insight into the effectiveness of their security systems   akamai optimized extranets is an ebusiness solution that improves the performance scalability and security of extranet business applications without requiring expensive buildouts 

 

   underlying all of akamai’s services and solutions is our edge control technology which provides comprehensive reporting and management capabilities often businesses use outsourced services to extend the reach and scope of their ebusiness initiatives and achieve the performance and reliability benefits that these services can deliver however for many enterprises outsourcing also means handing over the control of their ebusiness infrastructure to a third party typically relying on outside organizations forces a difficult choice gain the significant advantages of thirdparty content delivery services or maintain visibility and control of your own infrastructure and the flow of your own information   our edge control technology offers a suite of enterpriseclass management services for content and applications across the internet that help eliminate the need to make this choice by  5    our edge control offering seamlessly integrates with existing enterprise management systems allowing customers to manage their distributed content and applications via a common interface edge control provides integration with third party network management tools including those offered by ibm hewlettpackard and bmc software having created one of the industry’s first examples of a commercially proven utility computing platform we now provide a global network of servers that can be utilized “on demand” allowing customers to view and manage usage billing troubleshooting monitoring and reporting based on their individual business requirements business segments and geographic information   we operate in one business segment providing ebusiness infrastructure services and solutions for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 approximately 16 and 13 respectively of revenue was derived from our operations outside the united states of which 13 and 10 respectively relate to europe no single country accounted for 10 or more of revenue derived outside of the united states for all other years less than 10 of revenue was derived from sources outside of the united states revenue from services accounted for 98 89 and 83 respectively of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 for more information on our segments and geographic areas including revenues from customers see our consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on form 10k including note 19 thereto the akamai edgeplatform   the edgeplatform is the foundation of akamai’s business solutions we believe it is the world’s largest globally distributed computing platform with over 14000 servers deployed in over 1000 networks in 71 countries it includes specialized technologies including advanced routing load balancing data collection and monitoring that lay over the internet making it a predictable scalable and secure platform for conducting profitable ebusiness   our servers are deployed in over 1000 networks including tier 1 providers medium and small isps cable modem and satellite providers universities and other networks we also deploy our servers at smaller and mediumsized domestic and international isps through our akamai accelerated network program under this program we typically do not pay for rack space to house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content from our servers to internet users in exchange isps host our servers and obtain access to popular content from the internet that is served from our platform as a result when this content is requested by an enduser the isp does not need to pay for the bandwidth otherwise necessary to retrieve the content from the originating website   the key to the edgeplatform’s effectiveness is its use of a distributed computing model in which both content and computing applications are exchanged in a system of widely distributed networks of servers and processed at the most efficient places within the network through a combination of architecture and services akamai’s edgeplatform helps organizations maximize ebusiness efforts quickly without adding equipment cost or complexity to existing it infrastructure   akamai’s edgeplatform is also the first ebusiness platform to support edge side includes esi an open specification for dynamic assembly and delivery of highly dynamic web content at the edge of the internet using esi and the akamai edgeplatform companies can accelerate ebusiness applications while reducing complexity development time and deployment costs as the first application server to support esi the oracle9i application server allows customers to seamlessly write and deploy applications that are optimized to deliver dynamic web content at top speed across the akamai edgeplatform and oracle9ias   our edgeplatform is designed so that sites download and run more quickly deflect security threats and reliably process applications and deliver content — anywhere in the world customers are also able to control 6 the extent of their use of akamai services to scale on demand using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as is required to support widely varying traffic and rapid ebusiness growth without expensive and complex infrastructure buildout 

  we monitor the edgeplatform through our network operations command center or nocc located at our corporate headquarters with a backup facility in california our experienced network operations personnel staff the nocc 24 hours per day seven days a week we perform realtime monitoring of our own servers and of the internet to make certain that content is delivered to users with the best possible performance and reliability a key design principle of our system is the use of a distributed network of servers with no single point of failure as a result if any computer data center or portion of the internet fails our services will continue operating we constantly monitor the performance of connections between various locations around the internet and our regions using numerous types of network information to determine the performance of these connections the result is a “map” of the optimal akamai region for each location at that point in time we rebuild this map periodically to reflect changing conditions   our technology is designed so that our servers maintain redundancy with other servers in our network to ensure the highest level of performance and reliability for our customers this is increasingly important for reliably delivering the missioncritical content and applications of an enterprise over ip networks that on their own are often unreliable customers   our customer base is centered on enterprises as of december 31 2003 our customers included many of the world’s leading enterprises including apple computer inc best buycom inc fedex corporation general motors corporation microsoft corporation nasdaq mtv networks sony ericsson mobile communications and victoria’s secret we have also begun to address the needs of the government market and as of december 31 2003 had customers such as the centers for disease control and prevention the department of defense the department of education the food and drug administration the us army recruitment the us geological survey’s earthquake hazards program and the voice of america for the year ended december 31 2003 microsoft corporation accounted for 15 of total revenue no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2001 or 2002 sales services and marketing   our sales and service professionals are located in eight offices in the united states with additional locations in europe and japan we market and sell our services and solutions domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 25 active resellers including electronic data systems corporation ibm internap network services corporation mci telefonica group and others in addition to entering into agreements with reseller partners we have several other types of alliances including edge architecture design partners asp partners agency partners technology partners and network partners by aligning with these companies we are better able to market our services and adoption of our technology throughout the industry   our sales and support organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2003 we had 212 employees in our sales and support organization including 98 sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit train and retain sufficient direct sales technical and global services personnel and how well we establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners we believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel   to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai name we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements trade shows strategic partnerships and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2003 we had 20 employees in our global marketing organization 7 research and development   our research and development organization is continuously enhancing and improving our existing services strengthening our network and creating new services in response to our customers’ needs and market demand as of december 31 2003 we had 146 employees in our research and development organization many of whom hold advanced degrees in their field our research and development expenses were 130 million 218 million and 448 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively competition   the market for our services remains relatively new intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of    we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of these companies resell our services we also compete with companies that host online conferences using proprietary conferencing applications we do not believe that any other company currently offers the range of solutions that we offer through our edgesuite service proprietary rights and licensing   our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states patents covering our content delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending our issued patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020 in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology two of these patent applications have now been issued these patents will expire in 2018 we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code employees   as of december 31 2003 we had a total of 535 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good 8 factors affecting future operating results   the following important factors among other things could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

 

   we have never been profitable under generally accepted accounting principles we have incurred significant losses since inception in 1998 and expect to continue to incur losses through at least the first half of 2004 we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative interest and other expenses therefore we will need to generate higher revenue to achieve and maintain profitability there are numerous factors that could standing alone or combined with other factors impede our ability to increase revenue andor moderate expenses including  

 

   the market for our internetrelated services is relatively new we cannot be certain that a broadbased market for our services will emerge or be sustainable many of our customers are early adopters of new technologies such as those we offer if we are unable to maintain pricing levels or our market share among these companies our revenues will not grow and may decrease if enterprises that are less aggressive in adopting new technologies are reluctant to purchase our services we will have fewer opportunities to sell our services and will have difficulty generating growth and profits 

 

   we have significant longterm debt and we may not be able to make interest or principal payments when due as of december 31 2003 our total longterm debt was approximately 3860 million and our stockholders’ deficit was approximately 1754 million in january 2004 we issued an additional 250 million of our 10 convertible senior notes due december 15 2033 our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic 9 and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes 

  neither our existing 5 12 convertible subordinated notes due 2007 nor our 10 convertible senior notes due in 2033 restrict our ability or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future performance which is subject to many factors including factors beyond our control   in december 2003 and january 2004 we repurchased 990 million in principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes in february 2004 we announced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional 1010 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5 12 convertible subordinated notes the tender offer period is scheduled to expire on march 10 2004 there can be no assurance however that we will complete the tender offer in whole or in part in order to reduce further future cash interest payments as well as future payments due at maturity we may from time to time depending on market conditions repurchase or redeem additional outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes for cash exchange 5 12 convertible subordinated notes for shares of our common stock warrants preferred stock debt or other consideration or a combination of any of the foregoing if we exchange shares of our capital stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our capital stock for outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes the number of shares that we might issue as a result of such exchanges could significantly exceed the number of shares originally issuable upon conversion of the 5 12 convertible subordinated notes we cannot assure you that we will repurchase redeem or exchange any additional 5 12 convertible subordinated notes   historically we have had negative cash flow from operations for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash used in operating activities was approximately 180 million as of march 9 2004 we had 2010 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes outstanding assuming no additional 5 12 convertible subordinated notes are converted or redeemed our annual interest payments on our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes will be approximately 111 million and annual interest payment on our 10 convertible senior notes will be approximately 20 million in addition if our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes are converted or if we do not repurchase redeem exchange or otherwise repay our outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes prior to 2007 they will become due the holders of our 10 convertible senior notes have the right to require us to redeem such notes in december 2010 unless we are able to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service and in 2007 pay the 5 12 convertible subordinated notes and service the 10 convertible senior notes we will be required to raise additional funds or default on our obligations under our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes and 10 convertible senior notes 

 

   the holders of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes have the right to convert those notes into our common stock the conversion price for the 5 12 convertible subordinated notes is 11547 per share the current market price for shares of our common stock is significantly below the conversion price of the 5 12 convertible subordinated notes if the market price for our common stock does not exceed the conversion price the holders of the notes are unlikely to convert their securities into common stock and we will be required instead to pay the holders of such notes 

 

   our 1 convertible senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder under certain circumstances at an initial conversion price of 1545 per share the conversion of some or all of the 1 convertible senior notes and any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the existence of the 1 convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress our common stock price 10 

 

   if our revenue decreases or grows more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue we may need to obtain funding from outside sources if we are unable to obtain this funding our business would be materially and adversely affected in addition even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us if at all 

 

   we compete in markets that are new intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their services with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer or isps from installing our servers increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   prices we have been charging for some of our services have declined in recent years we expect that this decline may continue in the future as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we address consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenue based on comparable traffic volumes if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of “upselling” our higherpriced services to our edgesuite delivery customers our revenue and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 microsoft accounted for more than 10 of our revenue in september 2003 we entered into an amendment to our content delivery services customer agreement with microsoft that has a twoyear term and includes a minimum usage commitment microsoft will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by 50 for the second year of the term and convert the contract to a monthtomonth term after the first year if the parties fail to reach agreement as to appropriate price changes after the first year of the term while we expect revenue from microsoft to be greater than 10 of our total revenue in 2004 an unexpected significant decline in sales to microsoft would reduce our revenue and cause our business and financial results to suffer 

 

   the market price of our common stock has been volatile trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including the following  11    any of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall in addition the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our shares regardless of our operating performance 

 

   our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable distribution of application and content delivery services over the internet for our core services we currently provide a guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard our customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that day our network or services could be disrupted by numerous events including natural disasters failure or refusal of our thirdparty network providers to provide the capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users any widespread loss or interruption of our network or services would reduce our revenue and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

 

   our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers we believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons for example a number of these network providers are operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws as a result there is uncertainty about whether such providers or others that enter into bankruptcy will be able to continue to provide services to us any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us our business and financial results could suffer in addition our telecommunications and network providers typically provide rack space for our servers damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

 

   our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services if we are unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be identified we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 12 

 

   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about including without limitation taxes revenue recognition capitalization of internaluse software contingent obligations doubtful accounts and restructuring charges that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructuring charges and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances if our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are not correct we may need to accrue additional charges which could adversely affect our results of operations which in turn could adversely affect our stock price 

 

   we have licensed technology from mit covered by various patents patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patents patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patents and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

   other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services as a result we may be found to infringe the proprietary rights of others in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology our business and operating results would be significantly harmed companies in the internet market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights particularly patent rights we have been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging that we have violated other companies’ intellectual property rights any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following    if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

 

   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights we have brought numerous lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws 13 may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 

 

   our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that they rely on in implementing our business plan none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we have a “key person” life insurance policy covering only the life of f thomson leighton our chief scientist and a member of our board of directors the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

 

   we have operations in several foreign countries and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally such expansion could require us to make significant expenditures we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include  

 

   we have made acquisitions of other companies in the past and may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources without a productive result in addition with future acquisitions we could use substantial portions of our available cash or make dilutive issuances of securities future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 

 

   laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls 14 for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online this could negatively affect the businesses of our customers and reduce their demand for our services tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes that would adversely affect our profitability internetrelated laws however remain largely unsettled even in areas where there has been some legislative action the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or our operations or interpretations of existing law could adversely affect our business 

 

   terrorist attacks in new york pennsylvania and washington dc in september 2001 disrupted commerce throughout the united states and other parts of the world the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and abroad and the potential for military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market sell or operate our services and software our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

   provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition our board of directors has adopted and recently amended a shareholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction see “description of capital stock” 

 

   we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of the securities act and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended which we refer to as the exchange act this litigation could be expensive and divert the attention of our management and other resources we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this action any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

 

   in the ordinary course of business we may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   between july 2 2001 and august 31 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint an adverse resolution of the action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit   in february 2002 we filed suit against speedera networks inc or speedera in federal court in massachusetts alleging patent infringement and false advertising by speedera in april 2003 we amended our complaint to include an allegation that speedera infringes a newlyissued content delivery patent held by mit and licensed to akamai in response speedera filed a counterclaim in this case alleging that akamai has infringed a speedera patent relating to the combined provision of traffic management and content delivery services we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and intend to contest them vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this counterclaim   in june 2002 we filed suit against speedera in california superior court alleging theft of akamai trade secrets from an independent company that provides website performance testing services in connection with this suit in september 2002 the court issued a preliminary injunction to restrain speedera from continuing to access our confidential information from the independent company’s database and from using any data obtained from such access in october 2002 speedera filed a crossclaim against us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and alleging that we engaged in various unfair trade practices made false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair competition we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in speedera’s crossclaim and intend to contest the allegations vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this crossclaim   in september 2002 teknowledge corporation or teknowledge filed suit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against akamai cw and inktomi corporation alleging that certain services offered by each company infringe a teknowledge patent relating to automatic retrieval of changed files by a network software agent we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit   in november 2002 we filed suit against speedera in federal court in massachusetts for infringement of a patent held by akamai in january 2003 speedera filed a counterclaim in this case alleging that akamai has infringed a patent held by speedera we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and intend to contest them vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this counterclaim 16

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters   our common stock trades under the symbol “akam” from the time that public trading of our common stock commenced on october 29 1999 until september 3 2002 and since may 5 2003 our common stock was listed on the nasdaq national market our common stock was listed on the nasdaq smallcap market between september 3 2002 and may 2 2003 prior to october 29 1999 there was no public market for our common stock the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale price per share of the common stock on the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq smallcap market as applicable    as of march 4 2004 there were 589 holders of record of our common stock   we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on shares of our common stock or other securities and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain all future earnings if any for use in the operation of our business 


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview   we primarily derive revenue from recurring akamai services sold to customers under contracts of a duration of more than one year which we refer to as recurring revenue or longterm contracts these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is important to our financial success accordingly to be successful we must eliminate or reduce loss of monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations of terminations increase our base level of recurring revenue contracts on a quarteroverquarter basis and build on that base by adding new customers in the future and increasing the number of features and functions our customers purchase at the same time we must ensure that our expenses do not substantially exceed our revenue accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology see “factors affecting future operating results” elsewhere in the annual report on form 10k   our improved financial results in 2003 as compared to 2002 and 2001 reflect our ability to increase our monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated    since our inception we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology build our worldwide network sell and market our services and software and support our operations in recent years we have incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments and facility lease settlements we have not yet achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis however we have observed the following known trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operation in the future  19  20   based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and events we expect to generate net income during 2004 however our future results will be affected by many factors identified below in “factors affecting future operating results” including our ability to  as a result there is no assurance that the aforementioned trends will continue or that we will achieve our expected financial objectives recent events   in november 2003 we entered into an agreement with cable and wireless internet services or cwis leading to the dismissal of lawsuits filed by cwis against us in boston san francisco and london alleging that our services infringe several different cwis patents we did not admit liability or make any payments in connection with these dismissals as part of the settlement we also agreed to dismiss several lawsuits that we had brought against cwis in addition akamai and cwis agreed not to sue each other for a period of five years with respect to the patents and their respective service offerings that had been at issue in these cases   in december 2003 we forgave 247000 of 778000 due under a note receivable that had been issued to us by an employee that enabled this employee in 1999 to purchase shares of our common stock we recorded the forgiveness of 247000 as equityrelated compensation the remaining 531000 due on the note was paid in full in december 2003   in december 2003 we issued 1750 million in aggregate principal amount of 1 convertible senior notes in exchange for 1698 million in cash which reflected a purchase discount of 275 to the initial purchaser of the notes and other offering expenses the notes are due in december 2033 however we have the right to redeem the notes at par value in december 2010 and the holders of these notes have the right to require us to redeem the notes in december 2010 the 1 convertible senior notes accrue interest at the rate of 1 per year which is payable semiannually under certain circumstances holders of these notes may convert them into shares of our common stock at the price of 1545 per share as a result of this transaction we recorded interest expense including deferred financing amortization costs totaling 125000 in 2003   in january 2004 the initial purchaser of the 1 convertible senior notes exercised its option to purchase an additional 250 million in principal amount of the notes for a payment of 243 million net of the initial purchaser’s discount   in december 2003 and january 2004 in a limited number of individually negotiated transactions we repurchased an aggregate of 990 million in principal amount of our outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate cash payment of 989 million net of interest paid or payable to the holders   in february 2004 we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional 1010 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes under the modified dutch auction structure of the tender offer we offered to repurchase up to 1010 million in principal amount of validly tendered 5 12 convertible subordinated notes at a purchase price between 1000 and 1005 for each 1000 in principal amount tendered the tender offer is subject to numerous conditions the tender offer period is scheduled to expire on march 10 2004 21 application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts investments capitalization of internaluse software intangible assets income taxes depreciable lives of property and equipment restructuring accruals and contingent obligations we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

   we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make critical accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and the specific manner that we apply those principles we define a “critical accounting estimate” as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

 

   we recognize revenue from our services and software when    at the inception of a longterm customer contract for service we make a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably assured we base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check financial review the receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history with the customer upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy assuming the other criteria are met if we subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably assured we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received we also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we recognize   when we provide professional services such as custom applications and other services considered essential to the functionality of software for a fixed fee we recognize revenue from the fees for such services and any related software licenses as we complete the project using the percentageofcompletion method we generally determine the percentageofcompletion by comparing the labor hours we have incurred to date to the estimate of the total labor hours required to complete the project based on regular discussions with our project managers this method is used because we consider expended labor hours to be the most reliable available measure of progress on these projects adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known when the estimate indicates a loss such loss is provided for 22 in its entirety significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percentageofcompletion of each contract different assumptions could yield materially different results 

  other professional services not considered essential to the functionality of the software are limited and primarily include integration fees we recognize revenue from these professional services monthly along with the related longterm customer contract when we provide services on a time and materials basis we recognize revenue as we perform the services based on actual time incurred when we provide support and maintenance services we recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the related contracts typically one year 

 

   from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable 

 

   we periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is otherthantemporary we consider several factors that may trigger an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time the investment’s value has been below cost and the financial results of the entity in which we invest when we conclude that the reduction is otherthantemporary the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is otherthantemporary could increase loss on investments 

 

   we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such a triggering event occurs we compare the carrying amount of the longlived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis the critical accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets and the useful lives of these assets changes in these estimates could increase loss from operations materially 

 

   when we vacate a facility subject to a noncancelable longterm lease we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us in the latter case we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income to date we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan beginning in 2003 in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” we record restructuring liabilities discounted at the appropriate rate for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 23   as of december 31 2003 we had 52 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities in 2003 we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of 96 million we expect that approximately 16 million of the amount accrued as of december 31 2003 will be paid within twelve months in the event that we are able to sublease our restructured space we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable 

 

   we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the collectibility of accounts receivable we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   we have recorded certain tax accruals to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and property tax positions these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes rules regulations and interpretations our estimate of the value of our tax accruals contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of taxrelated assets and liabilities and the provision for income taxes we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in making this assessment we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether based on such evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods this assessment requires significant judgment in addition we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed probable that certain tax positions will be sustained 

 

   we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees who devote time to the application development stage of internaluse software projects if the project is an enhancement to previously developed software we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred during the application development stage for capitalization we must gather employee data for the amount of time incurred during the application development phase once the project is complete we must estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period results of operations   revenue total revenue increased 11 or 163 million to 1613 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 1450 million for the year ended december 31 2002 total revenue decreased 11 or 182 million to 1450 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 1632 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the increase in total revenue for 2003 as compared to 24 2002 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of 287 million partially offset by reductions in software and softwarerelated revenue of 28 million and related party revenue of 97 million the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed revenue along with usagebased customer revenue due to an increase in customer traffic delivered during the year microsoft corporation was the largest contributor to the increase in revenue attributable to usage that was not precommitted by our customers service revenue also increased due to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts as of december 31 2003 we had 1126 customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 955 as of december 31 2002 and 1078 as of december 31 2001 revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to a reduction in service revenue of 67 million attributable to a decrease in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts a reduction in software and softwarerelated revenue of 59 million due to a decrease in the amount of software and other technology licensed to customers as well as a decrease in related party revenue primarily due to the reduction in the monthly commitment of sockeye networks inc or sockeye 

  for 2003 and 2002 16 and 13 respectively of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states of which 13 and 10 respectively was derived from operations in europe no single country accounted for 10 or more of revenue derived outside of the united states for 2001 less than 10 of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states resellers accounted for 25 of revenue in 2003 24 in 2002 and 20 in 2001 for 2003 microsoft corporation accounted for 15 of revenue for 2002 and 2001 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of revenue   in september 2003 we executed an amendment to our content delivery services customer agreement with microsoft corporation the amended agreement has a twoyear term with a minimum usage commitment of 13 million the parties have agreed that in august 2004 they will negotiate in good faith appropriate changes if any to the pricing levels then in effect if akamai and microsoft corporation are unable to reach agreement on requested pricing changes the pricing will not change however microsoft corporation will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by 50 for the second year of the term and the services shall thereafter be provided on a monthtomonth basis subject to termination by either party on ten days notice   service revenue which consists of revenues from our content and application delivery services increased 22 or 287 million to 1574 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 1287 million for the year ended december 31 2002 service revenue was 1353 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the increase in service revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed revenue an increase in customer traffic delivered during the year and an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts the decrease in service revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue contracts partially offset by an increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer we expect service revenue to continue to increase in 2004 as companies continue to choose to outsource some of their it spending   software and softwarerelated revenue decreased 43 or 28 million to 37 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 65 million for the year ended december 31 2002 software and softwarerelated revenue was 124 million for the year ended december 31 2001 software and softwarerelated revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under longterm contracts the continual decrease in software and softwarerelated revenue for the periods presented reflects a reduction in the amount of customized software projects and other technology licensed to customers and a decrease in the number of perpetual licenses executed as we focus on our core services business   service and software revenue from related parties decreased 99 or 97 million to 137000 for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 98 million for the year ended december 31 2002 service and software revenue from related parties was 154 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the reduction in revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 from related parties was primarily attributable to revenue in 2002 from sockeye akamai technologies japan kk or akamai japan and softbank or sbbm a coinvestor in akamai japan with no associated revenue in 2003 related party revenue in 2003 represents revenue from 25 akamai australia a joint venture with es group ventures pty ltd relating to resale commitments in december 2002 and june 2003 the joint ventures of akamai japan and akamai australia respectively were terminated in 2003 akamai formed a whollyowned subsidiary in japan the decrease in revenue from related parties in 2002 as compared to 2001 was a result of the reduction in sockeye’s minimum monthly revenue commitment in 2001 and the cancellation in november 2002 of sockeye’s contract with us we expect no revenue from related parties during 2004 

  cost of revenue cost of revenue includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and colocation of our network equipment cost of revenue also includes payroll and related costs and equityrelated compensation for network operations personnel cost of licenses depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software costs   cost of revenue decreased 28 or 242 million to 611 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 853 million for the year ended december 31 2002 cost of revenue decreased 21 or 230 million to 853 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 1083 million for the year ended december 31 2001 traffic delivered over our network increased during 2003 compared to 2002 despite this increase in traffic cost of revenue decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to lower bandwidth costs which we achieved by entering into new competitively priced network contracts renegotiating existing network contracts to achieve more favorable pricing and continued improved management of our network traffic during 2003 depreciation of network equipment continued to decrease as our network assets became fully depreciated payroll and payrollrelated costs including equity compensation also decreased in 2003 due to a reduction in headcount cost of revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 by 230 million primarily as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our network lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic   cost of revenue during 2003 and 2002 also included credits received of approximately 30 million and 56 million respectively as a result of entering into new competitively priced network contracts and renegotiation of existing network contracts we expect that credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to lower our network costs however the timing and amount of these credits if any will vary   cost of revenue is comprised of the following in millions    we believe cost of revenue will slightly increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 because we expect to deliver more traffic on our network and that amortization of internaluse software development costs will increase we anticipate that these increases will be offset by a decline in depreciation of our network equipment in addition higher expenses associated with increased traffic on our network would be mitigated by lower bandwidth costs per unit if we are successful at continuing to improve our management of our network   research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equityrelated compensation for research and development personnel who design develop test and enhance our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except certain software development costs required to be capitalized during the year ended december 31 26 2003 and 2002 we capitalized 75 million and 60 million respectively net of impairments of payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network we did not capitalize any payroll costs in 2001 these capitalized internaluse software costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years

  general and administrative expenses decreased 42 or 409 million to 570 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 979 million for the year ended december 31 2002 general and administrative expenses decreased 20 or 240 million to 979 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 1219 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to reduced payroll and related costs including equityrelated compensation and reduced rent expense as a result of restructurings in 2003 general and administrative expenses also decreased due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated the decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts reduced payroll and related costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of facility restructurings the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in 2002 compared to 2001 reflected an improvement in the financial health of our customer base which had begun to include more customers that do not rely solely on internetbased commerce for their revenues the decrease in general and administrative over these years is quantified as follows in millions    we do not expect significant further decreases in general and administrative expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003 rather we believe that these expenses will remain constant in 2004   amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations amortization of other intangible assets decreased 81 or 97 million to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 119 million for the year ended december 31 2002 amortization of other intangible assets decreased 35 or 66 million to 119 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 185 million for the year ended december 31 2001 intangible assets acquired in business combinations were fully amortized as of the end of the first quarter of 2003 therefore there was no corresponding amortization of such intangibles assets in the remainder of 2003 the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the discontinuation of assembled workforce amortization in 2002 partially offset by an impairment to intangible assets in 2002 we expect to amortize approximately 48000 of intangible assets in 2004 and in each year thereafter through 2008 during which they will become fully amortized   amortization of goodwill we no longer amortize goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on january 1 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately 10 million to goodwill the resulting balance of goodwill was 49 million on january 1 2002 for purposes of performing an impairment test we determined that we had one reporting unit and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of january 1 2004 2003 and 2002 the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of january 1 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the fair value on january 1 2004 2003 and 2002 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill as of these dates accordingly we concluded that no impairment existed on these dates unless changes in events or 28 circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required we will next test goodwill for impairment as of january 1 2005 amortization of goodwill was 2373 million for the year ended december 31 2001 

  restructuring charges we recorded net restructuring benefits of 85 million as a result of amendments to and terminations of facility leases during the year ended december 31 2003 during the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 458 million which represents 36 million for employee severance benefits and 422 million attributable to facility leases and longlived asset impairments during the year ended december 31 2001 we recorded restructuring charges of 405 million which represents 51 million for employee severance benefits and 354 million attributable to facility leases and longlived asset impairments our restructuring expenses are summarized as follows in millions    during 2002 in connection with the termination of our facility leases for 500 and 600 technology square in cambridge massachusetts we recorded restructuring charges of 80 million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued also during 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 297 million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under noncancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties in addition we impaired leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures deposits deferred rent and other longlived assets related to these facilities in the amount of 45 million   during 2003 we amended or terminated three longterm leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of 161 million in cash and restricted cash as a result of these lease amendments and terminations we reversed 96 million of previously accrued restructuring liabilities and recorded 11 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility in europe these three transactions are as follows  29    the following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases in millions    we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future however we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our longterm leases if we believe it to be in the best interests of akamai and our stockholders we have estimated the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors   impairment of goodwill during the first quarter of 2001 we reviewed goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment under the guidance of sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” we considered several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred including our market capitalization compared to book value the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses a review of these factors as of march 31 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was required for longlived assets of acquired businesses we grouped all longlived assets for acquired businesses including goodwill and other intangible assets and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these longlived assets the discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses as a result of this analysis we recorded an impairment charge of 19128 million during the first quarter of 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value as of march 31 2001   interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on notes receivable for stock interest income decreased 57 or 17 million to 13 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2002 interest income decreased 75 or 92 million to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 123 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in interest income for each of 2003 and 2002 as compared with prior periods was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments we expect our interest income in 2004 to be consistent with 2003 as our invested cash balance should remain constant or slightly increase assuming consummation of the tender offer to repurchase 1010 million of our outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes in march 2004 with no expected change in the interest rates we expect to earn   interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations interest expense was 183 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 184 million for the year ended december 31 2002 and 189 million for the year ended december 31 2001 interest expense remained 30 relatively constant throughout the periods presented in december 2003 and january 2004 we repurchased 990 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5 12 convertible subordinated notes in february 2004 we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to an additional 1010 million in principal amount of the 5 12 convertible subordinated notes in december 2003 and january 2004 we issued 2000 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible senior notes if the tender offer is fully successful we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations will not exceed 105 million in 2004 

  other income we received 10 million in proceeds on a keyperson life insurance policy as a result of the death in september 2001 of daniel m lewin akamai’s cofounder   gain loss on investments net during 2003 we recorded a net gain on investments of 16 million of which 17 million related to the sale of equity investments in publiclytraded companies offset by losses of 55000 on investments in a privatelyheld companies and sale of marketable securities loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of 43 million related to our investment in netaxs inc a related party which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between netaxs and fastnet corporation in april 2002 loss on investments was partially offset by a gain of 400000 on our sale of our equity interest in akamai japan to sbbm in addition loss on investments in 2002 consists of a loss of 24 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value partially offset by approximately 149000 of realized investment gains for the year ended december 31 2001 loss on investments includes a loss of 102 million for the adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment that was determined to be otherthantemporary realized losses of 28 million and a related party loss of 20 million in an investment accounted for under the equity method we do not expect significant gain or losses on investments as our portfolio is comprised primarily of highgrade debt instruments   loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december 31 2003 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 21 million as a result of costs incurred in connection with our repurchase of 740 million in principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes during the year this loss represents the reduction of 12 million of deferred financing costs associated with repurchases of notes and 890000 of advisory services incurred related to the repurchases we expect to incur additional losses on early extinguishment of debt in connection with additional repurchases of our 5 12 convertible subordinated debt in 2004 see “recent events” above liquidity and capital resources   to date we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions    as of december 31 2003 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 2084 million of which 96 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash cash equivalents and marketable securities see “letters of credit and restricted cash” below 31   cash used in operating activities decreased 73 or 478 million to 180 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 658 million for the year ended december 31 2002 cash used in operating activities decreased 45 or 535 million to 658 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1193 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in cash used in operating activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1080 million or 141 in net losses before noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization loss on investments equityrelated compensation and loss on early extinguishment of debt cash used in operating expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 decreased primarily due to a decrease of approximately 54000 or 41 in net losses before noncash expenses   cash used in investing activities was 364 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 961 million for the year ended december 31 2002 cash provided by investing activities was 396 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in cash provided by investing activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to an increase in our net investment in marketable securities year over year cash used in investing activities for 2003 reflects net purchases sales and maturities of investments of 277 million and capital expenditures including capitalization of internaluse software development costs of 89 million cash provided by investing activities for 2002 reflects net purchases sales and maturities of investments of 1165 million less capital expenditures of 142 million including capitalization of internaluse software development costs cash provided by investing activities during 2002 also includes a payment of 65 million to cnn news group to settle an obligation resulting from our acquisition of intervu inc or intervu in april 2000 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion we expect total capital expenditures a component of cash used in investing activities will not exceed 10 of revenue in 2004   cash provided by financing activities was 1002 million for the year ended december 31 2003 12 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and 85 million for the year ended december 31 2001 cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects proceeds received from the issuance of our 1 convertible senior notes net of financing costs of 1698 million issuances of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plans of 86 million settlement of notes receivable for stock of 23 million offset by payments for the repurchase of 740 million in principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase 50 million in principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and payments on our capital leases of 14 million we satisfied the 50 million commitment to repurchase notes in january 2004 cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of 28 million and payments on our capital lease obligations of 16 million cash received from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans increased in 2003 as compared to prior years as a result of more option exercises in 2003 assuming consummation of our announced tender offer for up to 1010 million in principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes along with the issuance of an additional 250 million in principal amount of our 1 convertible senior notes and the repurchase of 250 million in principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes we expect our cash used for financing activities in 2004 to increase as compared to 2003   we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 2084 million will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and outstanding debt securities and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders see “factors affecting future operating results” 32 contractual obligations and commercial commitments   the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2003 over the next five years and thereafter in millions  letters of credit and restricted cash   as of december 31 2003 we had issued 46 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to longterm facility leases the letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities of which 39 million are classified as longterm and 726000 are classified as shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations as provided by the letters of credit   as of december 31 2003 we had 50 million classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet this amount reflects our commitment at december 31 2003 to repurchase 50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes as of december 31 2003 the related debt is included in our current liabilities as current portion of 5 12 convertible subordinated notes in our consolidated balance sheet offbalance sheet arrangements   we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors stockholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” we have not accrued a liability for any guarantee identified because the likelihood of incurring a payment obligation under the guarantees is remote see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements recent accounting pronouncements   in november 2002 the emerging issues task force or eitf reached a consensus on issue 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf 0021 addresses revenue recognition for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the deliverables in these revenue arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting when the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements and if the 33 arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered element delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable the relative fair value of each unit should be determined and the total consideration of the arrangement should be allocated among the individual units based on their fair value the guidance on this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into after june 30 2003 the adoption of eitf 0021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46 or fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities — an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” fin 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties and the equity investors lack one or more essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest fin 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 we currently do not hold any variable interest entities and therefore fin 46 did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements   in october 2003 the fasb issued fasb staff position or fsp 466 “effective date of fasb interpretation 46 consolidation of variable interest entities” this fsp deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin 46 for interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 fsp 466 had no effect on our consolidated financial statements   in december 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46r or fin 46r “a revision to fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46r clarifies some of the provisions of fin 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements fin 46r is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after march 15 2004 entities that have adopted fin 46 prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of fin 46 until the effective date of fin 46r we currently do not hold any variable interest entities and therefore fin 46r is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements   in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” this statement amends sfas no 133 to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis this statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 we adopted sfas no 149 on july 1 2003 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of debt that under previous guidance issuers could account for as equity sfas no 150 requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position sfas no 150 became effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise became effective july 1 2003 the adoption of the sfas no 150 did not impact our consolidated financial statements   in august 2003 the eitf reached a consensus on issue 0305 “applicability of aicpa statement of position 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software” eitf 0305 addresses the applicability of sop 972 to nonsoftware deliverables in an arrangement containing morethanincidental software in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole software and softwarerelated elements are included within the scope of sop 972 softwarerelated elements include software products and services as well as any nonsoftware deliverables for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality the adoption of eitf 0305 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results   in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin or sab no 104 “revenue recognition” which supersedes no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” sab no 104 rescinds 34 accounting guidance on sab no 101 related to multipleelement arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 the adoption of sab no 104 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

  we make available free of charge on or through our internet website our periodic reports and amendments to those periodic reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the commission industry background   the end of the 20th century witnessed the explosive growth of the internet and the emergence of ebusiness ebusiness is the use of the internet to streamline processes improve productivity and increase efficiencies enabling enterprises to easily communicate with customers vendors and partners connect backend data systems and transact commerce in a secure manner the internet however is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s business communication demands as a result information is frequently delayed or lost on its way through the internet as a result of many potential bottlenecks including    driven by competition globalization and costcontainment strategies ebusiness is becoming a critical component for corporate enterprises these trends require enterprises to rely on an agile ebusiness infrastructure to meet their realtime strategic and business objectives we expect enterprises to favor more decentralized information technology architecture to support their goals of disaster recovery high availability denialofservice mitigation and back up we also anticipate that enterprises will continue to expand their use of technologies that allow an enterprise to conduct business over the internet which are referred to at internet protocol or ip technologies our solutions   akamai offers a broad range of secure ebusiness infrastructure solutions and software that enable customers to reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a uniform ip infrastructure while ensuring superior performance reliability scalability and manageability forming the core of these solutions is our edgesuite offering a suite of services that allows enterprises to maximize performance and minimize cost while distributing their internetrelated content and applications using ip technology   by moving electronic content and applications closer to our customers’ end users our edgesuite service allows enterprises to improve the enduser experience boost reliability and scalability and reduce the cost of their ebusiness infrastructure we believe that our edgesuite offering is the only service available in the industry capable of providing the benefits of distributed performance to an enterprise’s entire website and all aspects of its applications our edgesuite service reduces the amount of ip infrastructure required to maintain a global internet presence site owners maintain a control copy of their applications and content and our edgesuite service provides global delivery load balancing and storage thereby enabling businesses to focus valuable resources on strategic matters rather than tactical infrastructure issues 2   customers of our edgesuite service have access to the following service and software features              3            business segments and geographic information   we operate in one business segment providing ebusiness infrastructure services and software for the year ended december 31 2002 approximately 13 of revenue was derived from our operations outside the united states for all other periods less than 10 of revenue was derived from sources outside of the united states for more information on our segments and geographic areas see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 4 the akamai platform   the akamai platform is the collection of akamai’s core technologies and global network footprint comprising intelligent core technologies such as advanced routing load balancing data collection and monitoring the akamai platform is designed to ensure the highest levels of availability reliability and performance of information flow between our customers and the internet   our platform consists of a global network of over 13000 computer servers and the complex proprietary software that resides on them our servers are deployed in over 1100 networks including tier 1 providers medium and small isps cable modem and satellite providers universities and other networks we also deploy our servers at smaller and mediumsized domestic and international isps through our akamai accelerated network program under this program we offer use of our servers to isps in exchange we typically do not pay for rack space to house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content from our servers to internet users by hosting our servers isps obtain access to popular content from the internet that is served from our platform as a result when this content is requested by a user the isp does not need to pay for the bandwidth otherwise necessary to retrieve the content from the originating website   we monitor our platform through the nocc located at our corporate headquarters with a backup facility on the west coast expert network operations personnel staff the nocc 24 hour per day seven days a week we perform realtime monitoring of our own servers and of the internet to make certain that content is delivered to users with the best possible performance and reliability a key design principle of our system is the use of a distributed network of servers with no single point of failure as a result if any computer data center or portion of the internet fails our services will continue operating we constantly monitor the performance of connections between various locations around the internet and our regions using numerous types of network information to determine the performance of these connections the result is a “map” of the optimal akamai region for each location at that point in time we rebuild this map periodically to reflect changing conditions   our technology is designed so that our servers maintain redundancy with other servers in our network to ensure the highest level of performance and reliability for our customers this is increasingly important for reliably delivering the missioncritical content and applications of an enterprise over ip networks that on their own are often unreliable customers   our customer base is centered on enterprises as of december 31 2002 customers who have adopted our services include many of the world’s leading enterprises including american suzuki motor corporation apple computer inc barnes  noble best buycom inc canon japan fedex corporation general motors corporation ll bean inc microsoft corporation molex incorporated nasdaq sony music entertainment japan staples inc verisign inc and veritas software corporation we have also begun to address the needs of the government market and as of december 31 2002 had customers such as the centers for disease control and prevention the us geological survey’s earthquake hazards program and the us government printing office for the year ended december 31 2000 apple computer represented 12 of total revenue no customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2001 or december 31 2002 sales service and marketing   our sales and service professionals are located in eleven offices in the united states with additional locations in europe and japan we market and sell our services and software domestically and internationally through our direct sales and services organization and through more than 20 active resellers including digex inc electronic data systems corporation or eds international business machines corporation or ibm internap network services corporation telefonica group and others our sales and support organization includes employees in direct and channel sales professional services account management and technical consulting as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 167 employees in our sales and support organization including 62 direct sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of 5 achievement of quota objectives our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on how successfully we recruit train and retain sufficient direct sales technical and global services personnel and how well we establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners we believe that the complexity of our services will require a number of highly trained global sales and services personnel 

  to support our sales efforts and promote the akamai name we conduct comprehensive marketing programs our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign print advertisements online advertisements trade shows strategic partnerships and ongoing customer communication programs as of december 31 2002 we had 29 employees in our global marketing organization research and development   our research and development organization is continuously enhancing and improving our existing services strengthening our network and creating new services in response to our customers’ needs and market demand as described in “our solutions” and “the akamai platform” above as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 152 employees in our research and development organization many of whom hold advanced degrees in their field our research and development expenses were 218 million 448 million and 382 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively competition   the market for our services remains relatively new intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service installations we expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants we compete primarily on the basis of    we compete primarily with companies offering products and services that address internet performance problems including companies that provide internet content delivery and hosting services streaming content delivery services and equipmentbased solutions to internet performance problems such as load balancers and server switches some of these companies resell our services we also compete with companies that host online conferences using proprietary conferencing applications we do not believe that any other company currently offers the range of solutions that we offer through our edgesuite service proprietary rights and licensing   our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely on a combination of patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology we currently have numerous issued united states patents covering our content delivery technology and we have numerous additional patent applications pending in october 1998 we entered into a license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology or mit under which we were granted a royaltyfree worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of mit under various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology two of these patent applications have now issued we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 6   to enforce our intellectual property rights we have filed a number of lawsuits against certain of our competitors additional litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our rights in addition we aggressively defend our technology and business against claims of infringement or invalidity brought by others for a further discussion of this litigation see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology any failure by us to meaningfully protect our property could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition see “factors affecting future operating results” employees   as of december 31 2002 we had a total of 567 fulltime and parttime employees our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom competition is intense our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we believe our relations with our employees are good factors affecting future operating results   the following important factors among other things could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

 

   we have never been profitable we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the future we have large fixed expenses and we expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth sales and marketing product development administrative interest and other expenses therefore we will need to generate significantly higher revenue to achieve and maintain profitability there are numerous factors that could impede our ability to increase revenue and moderate expenses including  our failure to significantly increase our revenue would seriously harm our business and operating results and could cause us to fail to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness 

 

   as of december 31 2002 our total longterm debt was approximately 3010 million and our stockholders’ deficit was 1681 million our 5 12 convertible subordinated notes due 2007 which we refer to as our 5 12 notes do not restrict our ability or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness 7 including debt that ranks senior to the 5 12 notes our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future performance which is subject to many factors including factors beyond our control the conversion price for the 5 12 notes is 11547 per share the current market price for shares of our common stock is significantly below the conversion price of our convertible subordinated notes if the market price for our common stock does not exceed the conversion price the holders of the notes are unlikely to convert their securities into common stock 

  historically we have had negative cash flow from operations for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash used in operating activities was approximately 658 million annual interest payments on our debentures assuming no securities are converted or redeemed is approximately 165 million unless we are able to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service the notes we will be required to raise additional funds or default on our obligations under the debentures and notes 

 

   if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue we may need to obtain funding from outside sources if we are unable to obtain this funding our business would be materially and adversely affected in addition even if we were to find outside funding sources we might be required to issue securities with greater rights than the securities we have outstanding today we might also be required to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common stock including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 

 

   we compete in markets that are new intensely competitive highly fragmented and rapidly changing we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition many of our current competitors as well as a number of our potential competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition broader customer relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements some of our current or potential competitors may bundle their services with other services software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing any service we offer or isps from installing our servers increased competition could result in price and revenue reductions loss of customers and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

   we expect that the prices we charge for our services may decline over time as a result of among other things existing and new competition in the markets we address consequently our historical revenue rates may not be indicative of future revenue based on comparable traffic volumes if we are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs our revenue and gross margins will decrease and our business and financial results will suffer 

 

   our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast efficient and reliable internet distribution application and content delivery services for our core services we currently provide a guarantee that our networks will deliver internet content 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year if we do not meet this standard our customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that day our network or services could be disrupted by numerous things including among other things natural disasters failure or refusal of our third party network providers to provide the capacity power losses and intentional disruptions of our 8 services such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by hackers any widespread loss or interruption of our network or services would reduce our revenue and could harm our business financial results and reputation 

 

   our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by thirdparty telecommunications network providers we believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our services however there can be no assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our customers in addition the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons for example a number of these network providers have recently filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws as a result there is uncertainty about whether such providers or others that enter into bankruptcy will be able to continue to provide services to us any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity we require due to financial or other reasons may result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers if we do not have access to thirdparty transmission capacity we could lose customers if we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us our business and financial results could suffer in addition our telecommunications and network providers typically provide rack space for our servers damage or destruction of or other denial of access to a facility where our servers are housed could result in a reduction in or interruption of service to our customers 

 

   our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex networks from time to time we have needed to correct errors and defects in our software in the future there may be additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely affect our services if we are unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be identified we could experience loss of revenues and market share damage to our reputation increased expenses and legal actions by our customers 

 

   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us such as those made in connection with our restructurings and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance however that our estimates or the assumptions underlying them will be correct as a result our actual results could vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals which could adversely affect our stock price 

 

   the price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to substantial fluctuations the following factors may contribute to the instability of our stock price  9  class action litigation is often brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their common stock if such litigation were brought against us it could be expensive and divert our management’s attention and resources that could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

   we have licensed from mit technology covered by various patent applications and copyrights relating to internet content delivery technology some of our technology is based in part on the technology covered by these patent applications and copyrights our license is effective for the life of the patent and patent applications however under limited circumstances such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the license agreement mit has the right to terminate our license a termination of our license agreement with mit could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

   other companies or individuals including our competitors may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our services as a result we may be found to infringe the proprietary rights of others in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology our business and operating results would be significantly harmed companies in the internet market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights particularly patent rights we have been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging that we have violated other companies’ intellectual property rights any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to do one or more of the following  if we are forced to take any of these actions our business may be seriously harmed 

 

   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights these legal protections afford only limited protection monitoring unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states although we have licensed and proprietary technology covered by patents we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented furthermore we cannot be certain that any pending or future patent applications will be granted that any future patent will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to us 10 

 

   our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technology sales marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that they rely on in implementing our business plan none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term we have a “key person” life insurance policy covering only the life of f thomson leighton the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our services 

 

   we have expanded our international operations to japan germany england and france in addition we are part of a joint venture in australia we expect to continue to expand our sales and support organizations internationally therefore we expect to commit significant resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities we are increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention these risks include  

 

   we have made acquisitions of other companies in the past and may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the potential distraction of management expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future we may be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources without a productive result in addition with future acquisitions we could use substantial portions of our available cash or make dilutive issuances of securities future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our ability to become profitable 

 

   laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent in particular the growth and development of the market for online commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax consumer protection and privacy laws both in the united states and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online this could negatively affect the businesses of our customers and reduce their demand for our services we could also be negatively affected by tax laws that might apply to our servers which are located in many different jurisdictions internetrelated laws however remain largely unsettled even in areas where there has been some legislative action the 11 adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or our operations or interpretations of existing law could adversely affect our business 

 

   terrorist attacks in new york pennsylvania and washington dc in september 2001 disrupted commerce throughout the united states and other parts of the world the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and abroad and the potential for military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market sell or operate our services and software our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

   provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders in addition in september 2002 our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plans the provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer of akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction 

 

   we are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection with our ipo in violation of the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 this litigation could be expensive and divert the attention of our management and other resources we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this action any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 

 

   in the ordinary course of business we may become involved in litigation administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses furthermore there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 








 item 2 properties tableend   our headquarters are located in approximately 89000 square feet of leased office space in cambridge massachusetts our primary west coast office is located in approximately 47000 square feet of leased office space in san mateo california we are attempting to sublease a substantial portion of our san mateo facility we maintain offices in several other locations in the united states including in or near each of los angeles california atlanta georgia chicago illinois new york new york fairfax virginia and seattle washington we also maintain offices in europe and asia including in or near munich germany paris france london england and tokyo japan all of our facilities are leased 


 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 12   between july 2 2001 and august 31 2001 purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us and several of our officers and directors as well as against the underwriters of our october 28 1999 initial public offering of common stock the complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during different time periods all beginning on october 28 1999 and ending on various dates the complaints are similar and allege violations of the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public offering on april 19 2002 a single consolidated amended complaint was filed reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions the consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period as october 28 1999 through december 6 2000 on july 15 2002 we joined in an omnibus motion to dismiss filed by all issuer defendants named in similar actions which challenges the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ claims including those in the consolidated amended complaint plaintiffs opposed the motion and the court heard oral arguments on the motion in november 2002 on february 19 2003 the court ruled against us on this motion and the case may now proceed to discovery in addition in october 2002 the plaintiffs dismissed without prejudice all of the individual defendants from the consolidated complaint although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint an adverse resolution of the action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved we are not presently able to estimate potential losses if any related to this lawsuit   in june 2002 we filed suit against speedera networks inc or speedera in california superior court alleging theft of akamai trade secrets from an independent company that provides website performance testing services in connection with this suit in september 2002 the court issued a preliminary

unfair competition we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in speedera’s crossclaim and intend to contest the allegations vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to this crossclaim   in july 2002 cable and wireless internet services or cw formerly known as digital island filed suit against us in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that certain akamai services infringe a cw patent issued in that month cw is seeking a preliminary injunction restraining us from offering services that infringe such patent subsequently in august 2002 cw filed a suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that certain akamai services infringe a second cw patent we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaints and intend to contest the lawsuits vigorously however there can be no assurance that we will be successful we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses if any related to these lawsuits   in september 2002 teknowledge corporation or teknowledge filed suit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against akamai cw and inktomi corporation alleging that certain services offered by

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview   the following sets forth as a percentage of revenue consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated    since our inception we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology build our worldwide network sell and market our services and software and support our operations we have also incurred significant amortization expense and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets from the acquisition of businesses in recent years we have incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments and vacated facilities under longterm leases since our inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses over at least the next 12 to 18 months as of december 31 2002 we had 300 million of convertible notes outstanding which become due in 2007 we ended the year with cash and marketable securities of 1252 million of which 134 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash   we believe that our success is dependent on increasing our net monthly recurring revenue developing new services and software that leverage our proprietary technology and achieving and maintaining a proper alignment between our revenue and our cost structure we consider net additions to monthly recurring revenue to be a critical success factor for our business we define net monthly recurring revenue as new bookings of recurring revenue less lost recurring revenue due to customer cancellations nonrenewals or collections issues a typical recurring revenue contract has a term of one to two years as of december 31 2002 our net monthly recurring revenue under contract was greater than such amount at december 31 2001 we continue to sell our services and software into a depressed information technology market we are also experiencing competitive pricing pressures on our service offerings due to these and other factors our ability to predict our future revenue results is limited and there is no guarantee that net monthly recurring revenue under contract will continue to increase 16   our ability to maintain gross margins that fall within our target range is also critical to our success accordingly we are continuously managing our network costs by entering into competitively priced bandwidth and colocation contracts that are aligned with our revenue forecasts and our estimates as to the amount of traffic we expect to carry over our network as a result we have been successful in maintaining our gross margins despite pricing pressure on our service offerings   we have taken steps to align our recurring operating expenses with our revenue and gross margins our recurring operating expenses include research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses these expenses were 1845 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 2596 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 2397 million for the year ended december 31 2000 during the year ended december 31 2002 we undertook actions to reduce our overall cost structure including employee severances while maintaining a high level of employee productivity and customer service as a result we expect the downward trend in these operating expenses to continue   our operating expenses also include restructuring charges we incurred restructuring charges of 458 million and 405 million during the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively these expenses relate to actual and estimated termination and modification costs on leases for excess facilities and employee severance costs we may incur restructuring charges in the future depending on several factors including the timing and amount of any lease modifications and terminations the timing and amount of any sublease receipts and any future employee severances we expect that if successful our efforts to terminate and modify our excess facility leases will require a significant amount of cash in the future recent events   in october 2002 we reduced our workforce by 29 or approximately 200 employees across all functional areas accordingly we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 of 36 million for onetime benefit payments to affected employees as a result of these actions we expect operating costs to decline in 2003 from previous levels   in november 2002 robert cobuzzi became our chief financial officer following the resignation of our former chief financial officer timothy weller   in november 2002 we settled a stock price appreciation guarantee to cnn news group or cnn by making a 27 million cash payment to cnn and allowing cnn to draw on a 38 million letter of credit previously issued by us we acquired the obligation as part of our acquision of intervu inc in april 2000 the settlement was accounted for as an adjustment to the fair value of the common stock for the amount of additional cash issued consequently the total purchase price was not adjusted   in december 2002 we sold our 40 joint venture interest in akamai technologies japan kk to softbank broadmedia corporation or sbbm prior to the sale sbbm had owned a 60 interest in akamai technologies japan kk we expect that sbbm will operate the entity as a nonexclusive reseller of our services in japan as a result of the sale we recorded a gain of 400000 in loss on investments net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 in january 2003 we formed a new whollyowned subsidiary in japan through which we sell our services and support our reseller arrangements the results of operations financial position and cash flows of the new subsidiary will be consolidated into our future quarterly and annual financial statements   in january 2003 we paid 25 million including interest to a former employee of an acquired company as a result of an april 2001 judgment against the acquired company for breach of contract we have included this amount in accrued expenses as of december 31 2002 in february 2003 we settled an employmentrelated lawsuit with multiple claims brought by a former employee for a cash payment of 36 million our insurance carrier reimbursed us for 18 million of such settlement expense as of december 31 2002 to reflect this settlement we have included 36 million in accrued expenses and 18 million in current assets and we recorded the net amount of 18 million in general and administrative expenses 17 change in presentation of consolidated statement of operations expense categories   in 2002 we modified the presentation of our consolidated statements of operations all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation these modifications had no impact on loss from operations or net loss we modified certain expense categories as follows    in addition we simplified the presentation of the consolidated statement of operations as follows  application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts investments intangible assets income taxes depreciable lives of property and equipment restructuring accruals and contingent obligations we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates for a complete description of our accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

   we define our “critical accounting policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the specific manner that we apply those principals that require us to make critical accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we define a “critical accounting estimate” as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 18 

 

 

 

   we recognize revenue from our services when    at the inception of a customer contract we make a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably assured we base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check financial review or the receipt of a deposit from the customer upon the completion of these steps we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy assuming the other criteria are met if we subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably assured we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received we also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we recognize 

 

   from time to time we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with an enterprise at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprise if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor unless the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be established objectively and realization of such value is assumed probable 

 

   we periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is otherthantemporary we consider several factors that may trigger an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time the investment’s value has been below cost and the financial results of the entity in which we invest when we conclude that the reduction is otherthantemporary the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is otherthantemporary would increase loss on investments 

 

   we review our longlived assets such as fixed assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset when such a triggering event occurs we compare the carrying amount of the longlived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis the critical accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the longlived assets and the useful lives of these assets changes in these estimates could increase loss from operations materially 

 

   when we vacate a facility subject to a noncancelable longterm lease we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred 19 under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us in the latter case we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income to date we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan beginning in 2003 in accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard we will record a restructuring liability discounted at the appropriate rate for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 

  when we record a restructuring liability we make critical estimates related to the amount of rent or termination costs that we will pay and the amount of sublease income that we will receive related to the vacant property as of december 31 2002 we had 375 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities our estimates are based in part on the most recent negotiations with the landlords of these properties and current market conditions we expect that approximately 236 million of the amount accrued as of december 31 2002 will be paid within twelve months should the actual amounts or the timing of restructuring payments differ from our estimate we would adjust the restructuring liability through a charge or benefit to restructuring charges on the consolidated statement of operations if we are not able to successfully modify these leases the total contractual payout for these properties would be approximately 640 million over the next seven years if we are not successful in subleasing these facilities the total incremental restructuring charge would be approximately 270 million 

 

   we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the collectibility of accounts receivable we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

   we provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a change in our estimate of the future realization of deferred tax assets would result in a material income tax benefit 

 

   we capitalize the salaries and payrollrelated costs of employees who devote time to the application development stage of internaluse software projects if the project is an enhancement to previously developed software we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software thus qualifying the work incurred during the application development stage for capitalization we must gather employee data for the amount of time incurred during the application development phase once the project is complete we must estimate the useful life of the internaluse software and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired changes in our estimates related to internaluse software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded in during the period results of operations   revenue total revenue decreased 11 or 182 million to 1450 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 1632 million for the year ended december 31 2001 total revenue was 898 million for the year ended december 31 2000 for 2002 and 2001 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of revenue for 2000 one customer apple computer accounted for 12 of our total revenue for 2002 13 of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states for 2001 20 and 2000 less than 10 of our total revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the united states 

  service revenue decreased 5 or 67 million to 1287 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 1353 million for the year ended december 31 2001 service revenue was 810 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in service revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue contracts partially offset by an increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer the increase in service revenue in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to an increase in customers under recurring revenue contracts although we have achieved positive net monthly recurring revenue during 2002 we are not able to reasonably predict future service revenue given the uncertainty of competition customer cancellations and the current macroeconomic environment   license and other revenue decreased 47 or 59 million to 65 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 124 million for the year ended december 31 2001 license and other revenue was 57 million for the year ended december 31 2000 license and other revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under longterm contracts the decrease in license and other revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a reduction in the amount of software and other technology licensed to customers in contrast we increased our license and other revenue in 2001 as compared to 2000 principally as a result of the introduction of our edgescape license offering in 2001   service and license revenue from related parties decreased 37 or 56 million to 98 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 154 million for the year ended december 31 2001 service and license revenue from related parties was 30 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in revenue from related parties between 2002 and 2001 was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue from sockeye networks inc or sockeye as a result of a reduction in 2001 of sockeye’s minimum monthly revenue commitment and the cancellation in november 2002 of sockeye’s contract with us the increase in revenue from related parties between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sockeye compared to the prior year as a result of sockeye’s cancellation of its service agreement and the sale of our equity interest in akamai technologies japan kk we do not expect significant revenues from related parties in the future   cost of revenue cost of revenue includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and monthly fees for housing our servers in thirdparty network data centers cost of revenue also includes network operation employee costs cost of licenses depreciation on the network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internaluse software costs during the year ended december 31 2002 we capitalized 174000 of payroll costs for network operations personnel related to the development of internaluse software used to operate and monitor our network no payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000   cost of revenue decreased 21 or 230 million to 853 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1083 million for the year ended december 31 2001 cost of revenue was 722 million for the year ended december 31 2000 cost of revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our network lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic cost of revenue increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation on network assets and an increase in the amount of traffic delivered over our network 21   cost of revenue is comprised of the following in millions    research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries equityrelated compensation and related expenses for the design development testing and enhancement of our services and our network research and development costs are expensed as incurred except certain software development costs eligible for capitalization during the year ended december 31 2002 we capitalized 60 million net of impairments of payroll and payrollrelated costs related to the development of internaluse software used to deliver our services and operate our network no payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000   research and development expenses decreased 51 or 231 million to 218 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 448 million for the year ended december 31 2001 research and development expenses were 382 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in salaries as a result of reduced headcount and reduced equityrelated compensation due to employee terminations in the research and development organization and an increase in capitalization of internal use software development costs the increase in research and development in 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payrollrelated costs as a result of increases in headcount and an increase in equityrelated compensation as a result of the issuance of restricted stock at below market value these effects are quantified as follows in millions    sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries equityrelated compensation commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing sales and service support functions as well as advertising and promotional expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased 30 or 281 million to 648 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 929 million for the year ended december 31 2001 sales and marketing expenses were 1109 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a reduction in payroll payrollrelated costs and equity compensation attributable to a reduction in headcount the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2001 as compared to 2000 was primarily due to a reduction in advertisingrelated expenditures partially offset by an increase in payroll and payrollrelated costs 22 attributable to an increase in headcount and an increase in equity compensation as a result of the issuance of restricted stock at below market value these effects are quantified as follows in millions 

   general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of depreciation and impairment of network equipment and property and equipment used by us internally salaries equityrelated compensation and related expenses for executive finance information technology or it human resources and other administrative personnel fees for professional services telecommunications costs the provision for doubtful accounts rent and other facilityrelated expenditures for leased properties during the year ended december 31 2002 we capitalized 732000 of payroll costs for it personnel related to the development of internaluse software no payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000   general and administrative expenses decreased 20 or 240 million to 979 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 1219 million for the year ended december 31 2001 general and administrative expenses were 906 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts reduced payrollrelated costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of facility restructurings the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in 2002 compared to 2001 reflects an improvement in the financial health of our customer base reflecting our strategy to target permanent enterprise customers the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due to an increase in provision for doubtful accounts an increase in payroll and payrollrelated costs an increase in facility costs due to an expansion of our operations and an increase in depreciation depreciation increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a result of increased purchases of property and equipment by us in 2001 these effects are quantified as follows in millions    aggregate research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses were 1845 million 2596 million and 2397 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively as a result of our actions undertaken in 2002 to reduce our overall cost structure including employee severances and lease terminations we expect aggregate research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative costs to decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002   amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets decreased 35 or 66 million to 119 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 185 million for the year ended december 31 2001 amortization of other intangible assets was 126 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the discontinuance of assembled workforce amortization in 2002 partially offset by an 23 impairment to intangible assets in 2002 the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2001 compared to 2000 was attributable to the recognition of a full year of amortization recorded in 2001 due to acquisitions of businesses in 2000 we expect to amortize approximately 23 million of intangible assets in 2003 

  amortization of goodwill we no longer amortize goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” on january 1 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately 10 million to goodwill the resulting balance of goodwill was 49 million on january 1 2002 for purposes of performing an impairment test we determined that we had one reporting unit and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of january 1 2002 and 2003 the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of january 1 2002 and 2003 respectively the fair value on january 1 2002 and 2003 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill as of both dates accordingly we concluded that no impairment existed on these dates unless changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required we will next test goodwill for impairment as of january 1 2004 amortization of goodwill was 2373 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 6635 million for the year ended december 31 2000 amortization expense declined between 2001 and 2000 as a result of an impairment to the balance of goodwill in march 2001    restructuring charges we recorded restructuring charges of 458 million for the year ended december 31 2002 these charges included 36 million for employee severance benefits and 422 million for restructuring charges attributable to facility leases and longlived asset impairments during the year ended december 31 2001 we recorded restructuring charges of 405 million these charges included 51 million for severance benefits and 354 million for restructuring charges attributable to facility leases and longlived asset impairments we did not have restructuring charges in 2000 our restructuring expenses are summarized as follows in millions    for the year ended december 31 2001 management approved an exit plan for excess and vacant facilities under longterm noncancelable leases we recorded a restructuring charge of 341 million for the estimated amount of future lease payments and termination fees less estimated sublease income for these facilities we also impaired 13 million of leasehold improvements located at these facilities the impairment was recorded as a noncash restructuring charge   during 2002 we terminated our facility leases for 500 and 600 technology square in cambridge massachusetts at an aggregate cost of 159 million including brokerage and legal fees as of the termination date the accrued restructuring liability attributable to these leases was 79 million accordingly we recorded an additional restructuring charge of 80 million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued also during 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 297 million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under noncancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties in addition we impaired leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures deposits deferred rent and other longlived assets related to these facilities in the amount of 45 million 24   the following table summarizes the establishment and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases in millions    the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases has been estimated based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors in the event that these facility leases are terminated at a higher or lower cost than the amount accrued as of december 31 2002 we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable if we are not able to successfully terminate or modify these leases the total payout for these properties would be approximately 640 million over the next seven years of which 375 million is accrued as of december 31 2002   impairment of goodwill during the first quarter of 2001 we reviewed goodwill and other longlived assets for impairment under the guidance of sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” we considered several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred including our market capitalization compared to book value the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses a review of these factors as of march 31 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was required for longlived assets of acquired businesses we grouped all longlived assets for acquired businesses including goodwill and other intangible assets and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these longlived assets the discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses as a result of this analysis we recorded an impairment charge of 19128 million during the first quarter of 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value as of march 31 2001   acquired inprocess research and development acquired inprocess research and development which we refer to as iprd consists of a charge for the value of development projects of acquired businesses in 2000 that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of business acquisition the value of iprd of 14 million was determined based on each project’s stage of development the time and resources needed for completion the contribution of core technology and the projected discounted cash flows of completed projects   interest income interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on notes receivable for stock interest income decreased 75 or 92 million to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 123 million for the year ended december 31 2001 interest income was 229 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in interest income for 2002 as compared with 2001 was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments likewise the decrease in interest income for 2001 as compared with 2000 was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments   interest expense interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations interest expense was 184 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 189 million for the year ended 25 december 31 2001 and 89 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the increase in net interest expense for each of 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 is a result of recognizing a full year of interest on our 300 million debt obligation which was incurred in june 2000 

  other income we received 10 million in proceeds on a keyperson life insurance policy as a result of the death in september 2001 of daniel m lewin akamai’s cofounder   loss on investments loss on investments for the year ended december 31 2002 was 61 million as compared to 150 million for the year ended december 31 2001 loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of 43 million related to our investment in netaxs inc a related party which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between netaxs and fastnet corporation in april 2002 loss on investments includes a gain of 400000 on our sale of our equity interest in akamai technologies japan kk to sbbm in addition loss on investments in 2002 consists of a loss of 24 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value and approximately 149000 of realized investment gains for the year ended december 31 2001 loss on investments includes a loss of 102 million for the adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment that was determined to be otherthantemporary realized losses of 28 million and a related party loss of 20 million in an investment accounted for under the equity method liquidity and capital resources   to date we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of capital stock and the issuance in april 1999 of senior subordinated notes which we repaid in 1999 totaling approximately 1246 million in net proceeds an initial public offering of our common stock in october 1999 that provided 2176 million after underwriters’ discounts and commissions and the sale in june 2000 of 300 million in 5 12 convertible subordinated notes due july 2007 which generated net proceeds of 2902 million we have also entered into capital lease agreements to fund the acquisition of property and equipment as of december 31 2002 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 1252 million of which 134 million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash   cash used in operating activities decreased 45 or 535 million to 658 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1193 million for the year ended december 31 2001 cash used in operating activities was 1229 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the decrease in cash used in operating activities in the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 41 decrease in net losses before noncash expenses such as depreciation amortization impairment charges loss on investments and equityrelated compensation cash used in operating expense in 2001 as compared to 2000 was consistent we expect that cash used in operating activities will continue to decline in 2003 as a result of actions we undertook in 2002 to reduce operating costs however the timing and amount of any lease termination payments and other working capital changes will affect the actual amount of cash used in operating activities   cash provided by investing activities was 961 million for the year ended december 31 2002 and 396 million for the year ended december 31 2001 cash used in investing activities was 3161 million for the year ended december 31 2000 cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 reflects net purchases sales and maturities of investments of 1165 million less capital expenditures of 72 million consisting primarily of leasehold improvements for our new corporate office facility and internal infrastructure purchases and 69 million for the capitalization of internaluse software development costs net of impaired projects cash provided by investing activities also includes a payment of 65 million to cnn to settle an obligation resulting from our acquisition of intervu in april 2000 see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion cash provided by and used in investing activities in 2001 and 2000 includes 645 million and 1319 million used for the purchase of property and equipment respectively we expect capital expenditures including internal costs for the development of internaluse software to be approximately 5 to 10 of revenue in 2003 we may enter into capital lease arrangements or use our available cash to fund these expenditures   cash provided by financing activities was 12 million for the year ended december 31 2002 85 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 3200 million for the year ended december 31 2000 cash 26 provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of 28 million and payments on our capital lease obligations of 16 million cash payments on capital lease obligations increased in 2002 due to 33 million of new capital leases we expect to make payments including interest of 13 million in 2003 and 11 million thereafter on these lease obligations cash received from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans declined in the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to prior years as a result of fewer option exercises in 2002 cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2000 included 2902 million in net proceeds from the issuance of 300 million in convertible subordinated notes due 2007 

  we believe based on our present business plan that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 1252 million will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 24 months if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenditures change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities these securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders see “factors affecting future operating results” contractual obligations and commercial commitments   the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2002 over the next five years and thereafter in millions  letters of credit   as of december 31 2002 we had issued 134 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of thirdparty beneficiaries primarily related to longterm facility leases the letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities of which 102 million are classified as longterm and 32 million are classified as shortterm on the consolidated balance sheet the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations as provided by the letters of credit offbalance sheet arrangements   we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties including vendors customers landlords our officers and directors shareholders of acquired companies joint venture partners and third parties to whom we license technology generally these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence these indemnification obligations are considered offbalance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 27 recent accounting pronouncements   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” which is effective in january 2003 sfas no 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting requirements for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs weare assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 143 will have on our consolidated financial statements   in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” sfas no 145 rescinds several statements including sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” the statement also makes several technical corrections to other existing authoritative pronouncements sfas no 145 was effective in may 2002 except for the rescission of sfas no 4 which is effective in january 2003 the adoption of sfas no 145 did not have and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements   in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas no 146 requires that a liability be recognized when it is incurred and should initially be measured and recorded at fair value in accordance with sfas no 146 a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit shall be recognized and measured at its fair value when the company ceases using the right conveyed by the contract for a real estate lease the fair value of the liability at the ceaseuse date is determined based on the contractual future lease payments reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 146 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation 45 or fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit it also clarifies that at the time a entity issues a guarantee the entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value or market value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin 45 apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 we are currently evaluating the impact that initial measurement provisions of interpretation 45 will have on our consolidated financial statements the disclosure provisions of fin 45 are effective for this annual report on form 10k accordingly we have included a discussion of our guarantees in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements   in november 2002 the emerging issues task force or eitf reached a consensus on issue 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf 0021 addresses the revenue recognition for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the deliverables in these revenue arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting when the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a standalone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements and if the arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered element delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable the relative fair value of each unit should be determined and the total consideration of the arrangement should be allocated among the individual units based on their fair value the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into after june 30 2003 we do not expect that the adoption of eitf 0021 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased 28 compensation” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results sfas no 148 is effective for annual periods ending after december 15 2002 and interim periods beginning after december 15 2002 the adoption of sfas no 148 will require us to include additional disclosures of equityrelated compensation in our consolidated financial statements including this annual report on form 10k 

  in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46 or fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entitiesan interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties and the equity investors lack one or more essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 we are currently evaluating the impact that fin 46 will have on our consolidated financial statements
